criminal
profiling
is
a
pretty
controversial
topic
among
professionals
for
every
criminal
profile
that
is
right
there
is
usually
one
that
is
wrong
the
efficacy
of
criminal
profiling
is
hotly
debated
it
does
n't
help
that
shows
misrepresent
what
it
is
and
how
well
is
works
in
certain
situations
","
it
may
be
possible
to
infer
some
psychological
traits
or
characteristics
of
the
criminal
through
profiling
with
a
reasonable
degree
of
accuracy
based
on
factors
such
as
who
the
targeted
victim
(
s
)
were
","
where
the
crime
took
place
","
what
evidence
was
left
at
the
crime
scene
","
whether
the
crime
scene
was
left
neat
/
clean
or
messy
dirty
","
etc
the
degree
to
which
these
profiles
are
accurate
tends
to
increase
with
the
number
of
data
points
(
e.g
crime
scenes
)
that
the
profiler
has
to
work
with
(
i.e
that
are
believed
to
be
linked
to
the
same
offender
)
profiling
specific
details
(
e.g
a
particular
car
model
)
can
not
be
done
with
any
sort
of
accuracy
unless
the
profiler
has
additional
information
(
e.g
physical
evidence
or
eye
witness
accounts
)
which
leads
him
/
her
to
make
such
a
conclusion
it
is
possible
","
however
","
that
certain
evidence
may
lead
the
profiler
to
suspect
the
criminal
drives
a
certain
type
of
vehicle
for
example
","
evidence
may
suggest
that
the
crime
was
politically
motivated
and
the
offender
is
an
environmental
protection
activist
it
may
therefore
be
predicted
that
the
offender
drives
an
environmentally
friendly
electric
/
hybrid
car
if
","
on
the
other
hand
","
the
criminal
is
suspected
of
being
a
hunter

it
may
be
predicted
that
he
drives
a
utility
truck

criminal
profiling
is
still
a
hotly
debated
topic
in
because
although
many
profiles
do
turn
out
to
be
quite
accurate
there
are
many
criminals
who
are
eventually
caught
and
do
n't
end
up
matching
the
predicted
profile
the
forensic
utility
of
profiling
is
still
questioned
and
it
's
important
for
people
to
realize
that
these
profiles
are
merely
educated
guesses
and
law
enforcement
should
not
eliminate
or
ignore
suspects
who
do
n't
fit
the
suspected
profile
source
in
&
most
of
the
traditional
real
life
profiles
are
more
demographic
based
than
psychology
based
that
is
","
they
figured
out
that
most
rapists

other
predatory
sexual
criminals

at
around

grew
more
criminally
sophisticated

often
more
violent

behaviors

let

it

an
audience

grew
up
with
that
audience
the
themes
in

progressively
more
mature

","
it
's
success
is
hardly
unrivaled

's
honestly
the

basic
story

been
told

centuries
a

other
very
successful
spins
on
this
basic
story
(

","
its
success
stems
from
rowling
's
ability
to
create
a
unique
world
and
populate
it
with
characters
we
can
root
for
and
against
i
think
what
separates
rowling
is
that
even
though
her
story
is
in
a
very
fantastical
universe

it
's
still
relatable
to
all

we
all

it
's
easy
to
recognize
the
awkward

who

learn

school
in

is
one
of
the
more
awkward

miserable
times

an
alternate
reality

school

actually
fun
","
your
best

really
are
forever
and
you
are
empowered
to
actually
change

i
think
the
franchise
's
success
came
from
the
fact
that
it
was
the
first
of
its
kind
there
really
was
no

such
an
overreaching
success
there
really
has
n't
been
a
story
quite
like
it

it
's
largely
politics
unions
tend
to
be
very
strong
supporters
of
the
party
","
and
that
does
n't
sit
well
with
republicans
but
","
for
some
specific
points
of
contention
*
unions
fight
for
what
they
think
is
a
fair
wage
some
people
think
that
wage
is
unreasonably
high
*
unions
support
closed
shop
laws
","
which
make
it
illegal
to
hold
certain
jobs
if
you
're
not
in
a
union
others
support
right
to
work
laws
","
because
they
do
n't
think
union
membership
should
be
mandatory
*
in
theory
","
unions
work
for
better
conditions
for
workers
however
","
some
unions
are
corrupt
","
linked
to
organized
crime
","
and
hold
nonunion
workers
in
contempt
what
i
know
of
my
company
is
that
i
make
much
more
money
than
my
unionized
counterparts
at
other
company
locations
and
my
benefits
are
far
superior
we
produce
a
larger
quantity
and
higher
quality
product
as
well
because
we
do
n't
have
senseless
union
red
tape
that
allows
us
to
perform
our
jobs
efficiently
for
instance
if
my
line
is
down
because
of
an
electric
motor
and
there
are
4
bolts
that
mount
it
to
the
floor
i
can
do
whatever
it
takes
to
compete
the
task
in
a
union
shop
i
would
have
to
wait
for
an
available
mechanic
to
remove
any
bolts
or
fasteners
so
that
i
could
remove
the
wires
if
i
were
to
do
it
myself
to
get
it
back
running
and
make
the
company
more
profitable
i
would
be
fined
or
fired
for
taking
work
from
another
worker
's
craft
and
violating
the
union
contract
a
union
is
essentially
a
representative
that
sits
between
you
and
your
employer
when
it
comes
to
matters
such
as
hiring
(
workplace
agreements
and
wages
)
","
termination
(
fair
dismissal
","
severance
)
","
strikes
and
so
on
for
workers
unions
are
usually
a
good
thing
","
because
the
union
represents
a
large
number
of
people
in
an
industry
they
're
in
a
good
position
to
negotiate
better
wages
and
working
conditions
than
any
individual
would
be
able
to
get
the
union
will
also
represent
you
in
workplace
disputes
","
and
can
sometimes
provide
legal
representation
unions
do
have
some
downsides
for
example
if
there
are
non
unioned
workers
in
an
industry
it
effectively
weakens
the
union
's
position
(
why
would
an
employer
agree
to
the
union
's
demands
when
they
can
just
hire
non
union
people
instead
)
therefore
in
some
industries
there
is
a
lot
of
pressure
on
workers
to
join
unions
if
you
look
around
you
'll
find
stories
of
strong
arm
tactics
or
even
open
hostility
employers
also
find
unions
difficult
to
work
with
an
employer
needs
to
consider
the
financial
situation
of
their
company
when
considering
things
like
wages
","
the
union
does
n't
have
the
same
concern
and
so
could
make
demands
greater
than
the
employer
can
cover
","
if
the
employer
does
n't
meet
the
demands
or
negotiate
them
down
then
they
risk
their
staff
going
on
strike
the
pro
union
counterargument
is
that
without
unions
the
employers
will
have
minimal
pressure
to
actually
raise
wages
","
and
that
factors
such
as
workplace
favouritism
could
end
up
with
two
employees
doing
the
same
work
for
different
amounts
of
pay
","
therefore
it
is
better
to
have
the
employer
and
the
union
negotiate
the
wage
for
everyone
we
could
now

weight

the

out

pretty
useless

often
you

the
bigger
a
ship
the
bigger

might
wait

he
might
wait

dock

become
a
sitting

a
third
choice

to
cruise

nautical
choke

range

offered

and
ships
tried
to
avoid
sailing

there
tended
to
be
a
good
deal

activity
when
it
was
optimal
for
sailing
once
a
ship
was
in

it
was
then
just
a
matter

who
was

better
seaman

which

in

cases
some
luck

20
miles

still
be

interesting
places
are
not
i
'll
assume
here
that
the
sail
is
n't
on

horizon

we
're
starting
from
scratch
write
a
letter
to
everyone
you
know

every
possible
port

ship
your
target
might
encounter
then
make
copies
leave
the
letters
for
the
packets

pick
up
packets
were
small

robust

fairly
fast
ships
that
were
the
stagecoaches
of
the
day
bus
","
part
mail
service
","
and
always
smelly
and
cramped
the
packets
would
run
a
route
picking
up
your
letters
and
dropping
them
off
at
the
destinations
some
packets
would
n't
make
it
or
the
mail
would
simply
be
destroyed
enroute
is
why
you
made
copies
other
times
the
packet
would
leave
a
letter
in
every
port
intended
for
a
specific
ship
is
why
you
made
copies
with
luck
and
few
weeks
or
a
few
months
later
the
letters
would
be
read
your
friends
write
back
and
describe
the
condition
of
the
ship
","
where
it
was
seen
","
and
what
activity
it
may
be
up
to
you
'll
read
weeks
or
months
later
however
now
you
have
a
reasonable
idea
where
to
start
the
search
if
the
ship
has
weed
on
the
hull
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
if
the
ship
's
rigging
is
old
and
frayed
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
if
the
ship
's
sails
are
thin
and
patched
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
so
now
you
have
an
estimate
of
the
speed
then
does
the
ship
have
enough
water
is
the
ship
using
gunpowder
excessively
or
conservatively
now
you
can
start
to
guess
how
well
supplied
the
ship
is
this
gives
an
idea
of
intent
once
the
search
region
is
known
then
it
's
all
about
guessing
where
the
ship
will
head
next
does
the
ship
head
for
fresh
water
does
the
ship
head
to
a
port
for
food
or
supplies
does
the
ship
head
to
sea
for
mischief
there
are
only
so
many
interesting
places
to
go
the
most
direct
routes
between
these
places
form
routes

the
destination
and
either
get
there
first
or
attempt
to
intercept
the
ship
at
sea
between
destinations
for
days
or
weeks
right
and
the
sail
should
appear
on
the
horizon
now
the
chase
begins
the
winner

the
faster
ship

the
one
that
does
n't
make
the
mistake

such
as
with
the
weather
gauge

plays
a
huge
factor

who
chases

spend
the

weeks

economic
harm

obligates
those

use
the
pesticides
monsanto

drives
those

they
had
a
pretty

then

with

hi
i
'm
from
you
've
gotten
some
good
answers
","
but
maybe
i
can
help
go
more
in
depth
the
very
first
thing
to
remember
is
that
in
more
expensive
cities
","
wages
rise
with
cost
inflation
now
","
it
's
not
a
perfect
scale
most
of
the
cost
inflation
comes
because
many
people
are
*
very
*
rich
","
not
necessarily
because
the
poor
are
less
poor
however
","
it
's
still
a
factor
there
are
fewer
minimum
wage
jobs
","
and/or
you
're
more
likely
to
get
a
job
whose
wages
are
above
the
federal
minimum
in
other
words
","
chances
are
the
same
job
netting
you
$
7.25
in
will
get
you
around
$
10
in
now
that
's
not
100
%
true
there
are
still
some
minimum
wage
jobs
here
how
do
people
get
by
","
about
like
anywhere
else
","
i
suppose
they
do
n't
get
to
enjoy
many
aspects
of
the
city
where
inflation
has
taken
hold
they
do
n't
get
to
go
out
to
dinner
at
the
nice
restaurants
or
go
drinking
in
bars
they
ca
n't
go
to
","
they
have
to
go
to
cheaper
grocery
stores
they
have
to
curb
themselves
more
","
and
they
get
government
assistance
*
*
like
anywhere
else
","
the
farther
you
go
from
the
cheaper
things
get
","
so
many
times
people
will
live
far
away
from
the
city
if
they
do
n't
make
a
lot
and
if
they
're
living
far
away
from
the
city
","
and
working
a
minimum
wage
job
they
can
just
as
easily
find
one
near
where
they
live
","
like
i
said
","
there
being
less
minimum
wage
jobs
in
the
city
it
all
*
kinda
*
evens
out
you
're
not
likely
to
live
in
and
have
a
minimum
wage
job
as
an
adult
matter
of
fact
i
ca
n't
think
of
a
single
minimum
wage
job
i
've
had
","
and
i
've
made
the
rounds
as
a
student
worker
","
busboy
","
waiter
","
receptionist
they
all
paid
around
$
10
and
one
last
thing
to
remember
the
cost
of
living
does
n't
*
have
*
to
be
high
in
this
city
it
's
totally
doable
on
less
money
the
reason
it
seems
higher
is
that
it
*
can
*
be
higher
and
most
people
making
very
little
tend
to
have
a
social
circle
where
people
make
standard
(
remember
how
i
said
there
are
n't
many
minimum
wage
jobs
here
it
's
rare
)
so
what
happens
is
most
of
your
friends
can
go
do
things
and
spend
money
where
you
ca
n't
so
it
*
seems
*
like
everything
has
to
be
so
expensive
here
but
it
does
n't
","
really
like
i
said
earlier
","
there
are
cheap
places
to
live
","
there
are
cheap
restaurants
","
cheap
grocery
stores
there
are
plenty
of
free
activities
for
entertainment
this
city
actually
caters
very
well
to
the
poor
","
it
's
just
difficult
if
your
social
circle
is
n't
as
poor
as
you
","
who
is
actually
in
right
now

in

platoon
it
is
the
's
job
to
maintain
accountability

does
this
by
maintaining
a

by
the

when

signed
out
from
the

injured

killed
during
combat
operations
he

put

","
whether
it
be
a

some
form

transportation

stripped
off

retained

crucial

a
machine

higher
rate
of
fire
than
the
standard
","
it
will
be
given
to
the
next
most
qualified
person
along
with
all
the
ammo
this
is
to
try
and
maintain
the
combat
effectiveness
","
how
many
bullets
you
can
throw
at
people
","
despite
having
less
people
as
for
the
gear
","
after
it
is
recovered
back
to
a
(
)
all
gear
that
was
worn
by
a
casualty
is
inspected
by
people
certified
to
determine
whether
it
is
serviceable
if
an
item
is
not

and
the
casualty

still
alive
the
inspectors
will
make
an
effort

send

home
it
is
not
uncommon
for
soldiers
who
received
gunshots

get

another
story
in
a
perfect
scenario

we
eliminate

have
time
to
investigate
any

the

makes
a
reasonable

the

a
high
priority
item

what

every
attempt

is
made
it
's
because
the
price
of
oil
is
dropping

it
went
from
a
high
of
around
$
100

barrel
in
down

","
so
that
's
more

the
cost

the

reasons

two
of
the
biggest
are
that

down

lowers
prices

refiners
do

have
to
put

it
's
seasonal

prices
will
surge
a
bit
for
the
winter
when
it
gets
cold

then
drop
off
again
in
the
spring
before
going
back
up
again
in

there
are
other
factors

the
past

natural
gas

have
some
similar
applications

have
had
a
downward
effect

we
're

use
oil
from

give
up

even

still
rise

population
growth
electrical
companies
spend
billions

if

they

they
charge
prices

some

right
there

because
they
were
so
close
to
the
end
zone
that
simply
running
it
in
with
(
an
amazing
running
back
)
would
have
almost
guaranteed
the
a
superbowl
win
my
understanding
is
that
the
decision
itself
was
n't
bad
the
patriots
were
arrayed
for
a
defense
against
a
running
play
that
is
","
they
were
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
a
running
play
would
face
more
resistance
the
knew
this
","
and
knew
that
the
expected
play
would
be
a
run
so
they
decided
to
try
a
pass
play
","
which
would
defeat
the
pats
defense
because
they
were
n't
ready

that
worked

it
would
have
been
a
brilliant
play

one
of
the
players
broke
at
exactly
the
right
time
to
intercept
it
good
play
","
shitty
luck
","
is
my
summary
they
were
so
close
to
the
goal
line
that
they
probably
could
have
just
run
it
in
not
have
worked
on
the
first
try
","
but
they
had
four
downs
to
move
just
a
yard
or
two
forward
","
which
seems
doable
","
and
which
would
have
won
the
game
instead
","
threw
a
risky
pass
which
turned
into
an
interception
","
effectively
losing
the
game
i
think
someone
made
a
bad
judgement
call
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
they
place
a
grid
on
your
body
usually
your
back
16
or
so
common
allergens
are
then
applied
to
your
back
and
they
see
what
your
body
reacts
to
answering
from
personal
experience
they
have
a
kit
containing
hundreds
of
different
common
allergens
and
use
a
special
tool
to
inject
the
allergens
into
your
skin
","
in
my
case
they
injected
my
back
then
they
wait
10
15
minutes
for
a
reaction
to
occur
the
areas
that
turn
red
indicate
you
are
allergic
to
whatever
was
injected
there
for
allergies
like
peanuts
many
people
find
out
by
accident
usually
when
they
are
young
and
the
allergy
has
not
yet
fully
developed
they
swell
up
and
feel
funny
after
eating
whatever
it
is
then
go
to
the
doctor
who
tells
them
they
had
an
allergic
reaction
tests
if
someone
has
a
reaction
but
it
needs
to
be
pinpointed
sometimes
allergies
are
discovered
during
treatment
as
a
paramedic
i
always
ask
for
allergies
in
a
patient
's
history
","
i
also
ask
(
even
if
they
say
they
do
not
have
allergies
)
before
i
administer
a
medication
every
patient
is
monitored
for
a
reaction
after
drug
administration
to
ensure
there
is
not
a
reaction
for
some
there
is
a
dedicated
test
","
other
times
we
'll
find
out
during
treatment
of
all
the
things
that
mutations
cause
(
that
is
","
mutations
that
happen
*
after
*
a
person
has
been
born
)
","
most
of
them
probably
just
end
up
with
the
mutated
getting
repaired
or
removed
","
or
the
cell
that
contains
it
being
destroyed
through
programmed
cell
death
is
the
result
of
a
mutation
that
removes
the
cell
's
ability
to
repair
or
quarantine
mutations
it
is
n't
that
so
much
of
is
devoted
to
reproduction
that
any
one
mutation
is
likely
to
damage
that
section
of
the
dna
it
's
that
","
of
all
the
mutations
that
happen
","
the
ones
that
can
survive
and
reproduce
are
necessarily
the
ones
that
alter
the
normal
reproduction
cell
death
processes
(
and
these
are
the
mutations
that
cause
cancer
)
other
mutations
exist
","
but
one
cell
having
some
odd
mutation
does
n't
do
much
mutations
that
lead
to
uncontrolled
cell
division
cause
that
one
cell
to
become
exponentially
more
cells
so
","
with
cancer
","
what
is
actually
happening
is
a
few
things
of
all
its
not
just
one
mutation
your
body
mutates
constantly
","
is
always
messed
up
","
and
even
then
your
gets
spliced
up
and
you
are
making
faulty
proteins
all
the
time
mutation
is
actually
how
things
evolve
partly
the
concept
with
cancer
is
actually
different
than
just
mutation
of
a
car
if
you
cut
the
gas
","
well
it
wo
n't
move
will
mutate
and
your
body
will
find
it
and
wo
n't
make
it
duplicate
or
be
transcribed
during
transcription
now
also
can
actually
not
be
picked
up
by
scanners
when
it
mutates
sometimes
we
can
call
this
cutting
the
breaks
so
during
transcription
lots
of
crap
happens
that
's
not
supposed
to
","
and
so
we
just
let
it
go
inside
the
cell
and
push
everything
that
has
been
made
out
of
the
nucleus
to
get
eaten
up
by
lysosomses
(
cell
stomachs
)
now
normally
for
actually
cancer
to
happen
","
we
need
about
5
breaks
cut
and
10
gas
pedals
broken
it
takes
a
lot
of
fuckup
to
actually
cause
cancer
and
if
it
does
happen
","
we
have
this
awesome
enzyme
called
p53
","
which
is
actually
one
and
i
mean
protein
made
to
just
deal
with
cancer
an
about
5000
different
enzymes
to
detect
it
and
stop
it
also
realize
there
is
cancerous
cells
and
go
about
trying
to
kill
it
","
but
then
if
we
cut
another
5
break
lines
and
another
4
gas
pedals
in
that
cancerous
cell
","
it
wo
n't
tell
other
cells
its
cancerous
after
that
there
s
a
tint
threshold
were
the
cell
will
try
to
kill
itself
","
but
one
more
break
line
cut
","
and
that
's
it
its
pretty
hard
for
this
process
to
occur
but
realize
mutations
happen
like
a
thousand
times
a
minute
","
and
the
gas
pedals

break
lines
of
replication

transcription

","
are
happening
all
the
time
they
do

quite
advantageous
in

the
more
wings
you
put
on

the
more
lift
you
get

the
more
drag

strengthing
structure
you
need
to
add

the
company

down

possible

using
the
smallest
amount

","
of

","
it
has
to
be
structurally
sound
the
plane
in
the
picture

probably
collapse
the
wings

creating
drag

they
are
all

pushed
backward

those
skinny
pylons

break

the
drag

be

backward

it

fly
well

if
at
all

do
work

did

all
of
","

a
more
powerful
engine
","
a
stronger
single
wing
","
and
a
swept
back
wing
shape
are
all
designed
for
strength

efficiency
the
most
efficient
design
is
two
long
skinny
wings
","
but
material
strength
has
n't
quite
made
that
possible
for
commercial
use
it
's
not
so
much
that
they
ca
n't
work
","
but
rather
that
there
's
no
need
your
question
is
sort
of
like
asking
why
do
n't
cars
have
8
wheels
early
airplane
prototypes
lacked
solid
aerodynamic
information
for
how
to
design
wings
and
","
as
a
result
","
had
very
inefficient
wings
(
very
little
lift
generated
)
rather
than
redesign
the
wings
","
many
early
aviators
simply
tried
adding
more
wings
of
course
","
the
problem
with
this
was
making
sure
that
the
structure
to
support
all
the
wings
was
strong
enough
","
which
it
often
was
n't
for
example
","
here
's
some
newsreel
footage
of
the
same
plane
in
the
image
you
linked
(
the
[
(
)
)
url_0
once
aerodynamics
were
more
well
understood
","
the
need
for
multiple
wings
declined
and
eventually
disappeared
it
's
also
worth
noting
that
planes
with
multiple
sets
of
wings
can
have
problems
if
one
set
produces
much
more
lift
than
the
others
the
i
(
better
known
as
simply
the
or
the
's
plane
)
","
for
example
","
had
problems
with
the
top
wing
producing
so
much
more
lift
than
the
other
two
wings
that
the
top
wing
would
rip
itself
off
of
the
aircraft
at
high
speeds
this
behavior
tended
to
cause
problems
and
was
one
of
many
reasons
why
","
despite
its
prevalence
in
popular
lore
","
the
i
saw
only
limited
use
in
actual
combat
so
","
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is
that
","
with
our
ability
to
generate
more
than
enough
lift
with
a
single
set
of
wings
","
the
need
for
multiple
sets
of
wings
has
passed
a
more
accurate
way
to
phrase
the
question
","
a
way
that
would
also
more
or
less
answer
it
","
is
to
ask
","
what
is
the
evolutionary
disadvantage
of
wisdom
teeth
to
someone
who
has
not
yet
procreated
the
answer
is
not
much
it
's
tempting
to
think
that
evolution
means
useless
things
should
disappear
over
time
","
sort
of
like
a
genetic
atrophy
","
but
they
do
n't
work
that
way
something
has
to
specifically
select
against
the
useless
feature
if
having
wisdom
teeth
made
people
less
attractive
","
or
raised
the
likelihood
of
them
dying
before
reproducing
","
then
we
could
postulate
that
there
would
be
evolutionary
pressure
against
larger
wisdom
teeth
and
that
","
over
time
","
more
and
more
people
with
smaller
wisdom
teeth
would
be
selected
","
leading
to
a
gradual
evolutionary
decline
in
wisdom
teeth
since
that
's
not
the
case
","
they
're
here
to
stay
an
analogue
to
help
cement
the
idea
would
be
the
appendix
if
it
's
so
useless
and
so
(
potentially
)
lethal
","
why
do
we
still
have
it
because
by
the
time
someone
's
appendix
becomes
inflamed
","
they
've
probably
already
had
kids
and
passed
the
genes
along
if
the
median
age
for
appendicitis
over
the
last
couple
thousand
years
was
more
in
the
range
of
five
years
old
","
there
would
be
much
greater
selective
pressure
to
eliminate
it
they
are
a
holdover
from
a
time
when
our
jaws
were
different
prior
to
modern
dentistry
","
most
people
would
lose
some
teeth
or
grind
some
down
by
the
time
they
reached
adulthood
so
it
was
helpful
to
have
some
extra
teeth
come
in
later
","
to
pick
up
the
slack
they
're
only
a
problem
now
because
we
have
such
good
dental
hygiene
that
we
do
n't
lose
teeth
","
so
there
's
nowhere
for
the
wisdom
teeth
to
go
because
those
are
the
people
who
live
in
less
desirable
neighborhoods
(
for
both
environmental
and
safety
factors
)
they
are
more
likely
to
be
under
insured
and
will
forgo
preventative
care
because
they
can
not
afford
it
","
so
the
first
time
they
see
a
doctor
about
a
health
issue
is
when
it
has
grown
too
serious
to
ignore
any
longer
factors
of
poorer
nutrition
options
","
lack
of
access
to
quality
prenatal
care

general
stress

living

poverty

contribute
to
an
increase
in
disease

empty

jury

part
of
a
normal
trial
(
at
least
for
some
kinds
of
cases
it
varies
by
state

a
grand
jury
is
a
group
of
people
that

prosecutor
has
to
convince
he
has
a
case
he
does
n't
have
to
prove
that

guilty

just
that
there
's
enough
evidence

idea
here
is
that
the
trial
itself

not
be
inflicted

someone
who
is
obviously
innocent

charges

not
be
a
weapon

innocent
charges
charging
innocent
people

still
happen

but
this
step
is
intended
to
minimize
it
the
controversy
is
that
generally
grand
juries
are
very
easy
to
convince
and
many
see
them
as
a
formality
more
than
anything
when
a
high
profile
case
does
n't
get
an
indictment
(
i.e
a
formal
accusation
against
someone
that
a
crime
was
committed
pronounced
in
dight
ment
)
it
raises
a
question
of
whether
the
prosecutor
was
really
trying
to
get
the
grand
jury
to
indict
many
feel
that
even
though
the
officer
in
the
case
would
likely
have
been
found
innocent
that
it
was
not
the
prosecutor
's
place
to
present
such
a
weak
case
to
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
stop
the
case
then

there
the

the

a
preliminary
proceeding
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
there
is
a
good
enough
reason
to
have
a
trial
the
difference
between
a
grand
jury
and
a
normal
jury
(
i.e
","
a
trial
)
is
that
a
grand
jury
is
a
closed
","
one
sided
hearing
where
the
prosecutor
is
tasked
with
demonstrating
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
defendant
committed
the
particular
crime
usually
","
a
two
thirds
supermajority
agreement
among
the
jurors
is
required
to
indict
the
defendant
(
i.e

two
thirds

agree
that

probable
cause

","
thus
warranting
a
full
trial
)
if
two
thirds
of
the
jurors
indict
the
defendant
","
it
does
not
mean
he
is
convicted
it
means
there
is
enough
evidence
that
there
should
be
a
full
trial
unlike
during
the
grand
jury
","
at
a
full
trial
the
defendant
enjoys
his
sixth
amendment
rights
to
counsel
","
to
confront
his
accusers
","
and
to
a
public
proceeding
what
i
mean
is
that
during
a
grand
jury
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
call
his
own
witnesses
","
nor
cross
examine
witnesses
that
testify
against
him
(
or
more
accurately
have
a
lawyer
do
those
things
)
","
and
he
has
no
right
to
public
oversight
during
a
trial
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
","
who
can
introduce
evidence
and
call
witnesses
on
his
behalf
and
cross
examine
opposing
witnesses
in
an
a
hearing
opened
to
public
oversight
also
","
the
trial
requires
the
jury
to
unanimously
vote
that
he
committed
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
convict
him
this
is
a
much
harder
standard
than
the
grand
jury
's
2/3
's
majority
vote
for
probable
cause
it
's
also
worth
noting
that
not
all
states
employ
grand
juries
for
example
","
in
my
state
a
preliminary
hearing
substitutes
for
the
grand
jury
during
my
state
's
preliminary
hearings
","
the
prosecutor
is
tasked
with
introducing
evidence
before
a
judge
(
without
a
jury
)
","
and
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
argue
against
that
evidence
and
cross
examine
the
prosecutor
's
witnesses
in
this
scenario
the
judge
(
and
not
a
jury
)
decides
whether
there
is
enough
probable
cause
for
the
case
to
go
to
trial
this
is
not
to
say
that
some
states
only
do
grand
juries
","
and
other
states
only
do
preliminary
hearings
my
state
has
certain
policies
where
it
will
use
a
grand

rather

a
preliminary

e.g
","
where
there
is

know

use

a
capital

cop
it
would
be
at
the
's
discretion

it
's
probably
really
just
politics

it
should
be
noted
that
the
rules

whether

not

must
be

what

sexual
selection
seems
to
be
one
of

key
factors

the

characteristics

","
men

broader
shoulders
conversely
women
have
wider
hips
","
are
shorter

have
a
higher
fat

men
historically
have
been
considered
the
better

women

better

in

reproductive

would
have
influenced
the
sexual
selection

either
sex

in
laments
terms
men
with
more
masculine
features

more
sexually
desirable

and
women
with
more
feminine
features

more
sexually
desirable

speaking

these

characteristics

also
influenced
other

we
have
associated

better
mates
men
having
wider

squarer
jaw
lines

females
having
the

a

investigator
in

situation

determine
the
difference

i
do
think
there
are
certain
aspects

are
absolute

like
nose

eye
width

so
on
men

have
hard

rugged
facial

nerves
in

activated

those
nerves
meet
at
several
junctions

'
gates
'
at
those
junctions
","
bunches
of
nerves
coming
from
nearby
all
gather
together
on
the
way
to
the
brain
at
each
gate
","
the
signals
from
all
the
bundled
nerves
are
processed
together

","
two
nerves
work
together
to
increase

nerves
coming
from
the

as

central
control

change
the

signal

on

sometimes
the
signal
is
increased

and
sometimes
it
's
decreased

the
history

their
development
","
our
brains
have
gotten
good
at
learning
what
signals
they
should
pay
attention
to
","
and
what
signals
they
can
ignore
one
of
the
signals
the
brain
has
learned
to
ignore
is
self
touch
it
is
n't
dangerous
","
and
we
usually
only
need
to
be
partially
aware
of
it
walking
through
a
spider
web
and
touching
your
hand
to
your
face
are
two
different
experiences
","
and
for
good
reason
when
the
brain
identifies
self
touch
","
it
uses
those
feedback
fibers
i
mentioned
before
to
suppress
the
intensity
of
sensation
","
which
makes
it
easier
to
ignore
also
","
when
a
signal
arrives
in
the
brain
","
several
regions
cooperate
to
figure
out
exactly
what
it
is
","
where
it
came
from
","
and
what
to
do
about
it
when
we
identify
self
touch
","
there
are
regions
of
our
brain
that
are
trained
to
say
ignore
it
as
a
result
","
we
suppress
the
intensity
of
those
signals
to
put
it
simply
","
our
nerves
have
gates
that
allow
certain
information
to
pass
","
when
your
scratching
the
itch
yourself
those
gates
are
competing
with
each
other
to
send
information
about
pleasure
","
as
well
as
touch
and
muscle
contraction
having
someone
else
do
it
means
there
is
only
the
pleasure
sensation
needing
to
be
sent
through
those
gates
","
so
the
pleasure
is
stronger
an
example
of
this
is
when
your
foot
falls
asleep
and
it
feels
like
there
are
hot
pins
and
needles
in
it
when
the
flow
stops
the
nerves

react
to
touch
and
pressure
stop
","
but
the
various
pain
receptors
maintain
priority
and
get
what
little
oxygen
is
in
the
blood
so
once
you
start
using
it
those
pain
receptors
are
n't
competing
with
anything

all
you

than
shimmying

up

wide
most
of
the
time
you
'd
be
fine
but
on
occasions
you
could
find
yourself
landing
in
downtown
i
can
think
of
three
reasons
firstly
","
lakes
are
smaller
","
and
therefore
there
is
a
greater
chance
that
the
capsule
might
miss
the
lake
if
the
capsule
aimed
for
the
","
and
missed
","
it
might
fall
on
","
","
","
and
other
large
cities
also
","
the
smaller
size
of
the
lakes
means
the
many
ships
travelling
within
them
are
more
compact
the
odds
of
hitting
a
random
cargo
ship
in
the
ocean
is
small
","
but
the
chance
of
hitting
a
cargo
ship
in
the
lakes
is
a
bit
higher
secondly
","
there
are
not
nearly
as
many
recovery
ships
in
lakes
as
there
are
in
the
ocean
if
the
capsule
got
lost
","
they
could
send
a
whole
fleet
of
warships
from
many
nations
to
find
it
on
the
lakes
","
there
are
only
a
few
coast
guard
vessels
available
thirdly
","
inland
waterways
","
such
as
lakes
","
have
strict
anti
pollution
regulations
","
more
so
than
in
the
open
ocean
if
the
capsule
sank
in
the
lakes
","
then
could
face
repercussion
form
the
a
person
's
net
worth
is
the
value
of
all
their
assets
","
minus
debts
it
's
all
your
assets
(
cash
","
investments
","
houses
","
stuff
)
minus
all
your
liabilities
(
credit
cards
","
mortgages
","
etc
)
your
net
worth
is
a
snapshot
of
your
*
present
financial
status
it
's
calculated
pretty
easily
","
add
up
the
value
of
everything
you
own

)
and
subtract
the
value
of
everything
you
owe
(
mortgage
","

card
debt

etc

i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
government
is
n't
really
anything
like
personal
debt
but
it
might
help
put
things
in
perspective
using
a
more
familiar
idea
we
can
grasp
of
the
problem
with
the
perception
of
our
debt
being
a
big
problem
is
that
the
numbers
are
big
bogglingly
big
scary
big
our
debt
is
roughly
$
"17,000,000,000,000"
and
","
yes
","
that
is
a
big
number
but
let
me
show
you
another
number
$
"17,000,000,000,000"
why
","
yes
that
is
the
same
number
$
"17,000,000,000,000"
also
happens
to
be
our
or
","
which
is
what
our
country
produces
in
a
year
of
the
as
our
annual
salary
as
a
country
now
if
you
met
a
person
who
made
$
"170,000"
a
year
(
a
much
easier
number
to
get
your
head
around
)
and
that
person
was
in
debt
to
the
tune
of
$
"170,000"
say
with
a
house
a
couple
of
credit
cards
and
that
person
always
paid
all
of
his
bills
all
the
time
","
most
people
would
say
that
person
has
very
good
credit
and
is
n't
at
risk
of
going
bankrupt
and
would
likely
be
a
particularly
good
candidate
if
they
decided
to
get
another
loan
and
so
long
as
their
income
grows
proportionally
with
their
debt
and
they
keep
paying
their
bills
","
they
'll
continue
to
be
a
safe
bet
to
continue
to
receive
loans
in
other
words
","
if
their
debt
rose
to
$
"200,000"
","
that
'd
be
okay
if
their
income
was
also
in
the
neighborhood
of
$
"200,000"
now
what
you
want
to
know
is
can
the
debt
ever
be
repaid
and
the
simple
answer
is
","
yes
","
but
you
would
n't
really
want
to
keeping
our
house
metaphor
in
tact
for
the
time
being
","
if
we
wanted
to
get
out
of
debt
","
we
could
pay
less
for
the
stuff
we
use
and
use
the
difference
to
pay
down
our
debt
but
there
's
a
problem
what
do
we
cut
everything
we
're
spending
money
on
we
more
or
less
need
sure
","
we
could
nibble
around
the
edges
and
find
a
few
dollars
here
and
there
","
but
not
enough
to
make
a
really
big
difference
going
back
to
our
full
scale
debt
","
it
sounds
good
to
say
you
're
going
to
cut
our
$
10
million
budget
for
ketchup
research
or
$
6
million
in
pork
for
a
courthouse
in
","
but
that
's
like
saying
you
're
going
to
pay
off
your
mortgage
by
rummaging
around
for
spare
change
in
your
couch
when
trillions
are
on
the
table
","
millions
wo
n't
cut
it
and
billions
will
barely
touch
it
is
n't
to
say
it
's
impossible
just
about
20
years
ago
the
administration
had
a
plan
to
pay
down
the
national
debt
by
raising
taxes
and
cutting
spending
according
to
that
plan
","
we
would
have
paid
off
the
national
debt
by
the
far
off
future
year
of
2011
unfortunately
","
when
we
went
to
war
in
and
in
2002
and
2003
","
that
added
expense
sidelined
the
debt
repayment
and
ballooned
our
debt
and
then
in
2008
and
2009
the
financial
crisis
happened
and
various
stimulus
packages
and
tax
relief
packages
meant
our
debt
ballooned
again
it
's
really
been
a
lousy
decade
for
debt
and
deficit
but
have
no
fear
should
we
do
the
obvious
yet
politically
suicidal
thing
of
raising
taxes
and
cutting
spending
we
can
get
our
debt
under
control
again
(
until
the
next
big
crisis
","
at
least
)
but
we
do
n't
want
to
pay
it
off
","
mostly
because
a
lot
of
our
debt
is
n't
owned
by
foreign
countries
it
's
owned
by
people
like
you
and
me
in
the
form
of
government
bonds
(
you
buy
xx
in
from
the
government
and
they
'll
pay
you
back
xx
plus
interest
after
a
given
amount
of
time
and
these
are
generally
seen
as
safe
but
low
(
er
)
return
parts
of
many
investment
portfolios
for
individuals
and
businesses
)
if
the
government
is
debt
free
","
that
means
there
are
no
bonds
to
invest
in
","
which
is
n't
very
good
for
the
economy
economists
might
disagree
on
how
much
debt
is
good
and
how
much
is
bad
but
most
would
agree
that
it
's
best
to
have
some
so
that
it
our
debt
is
big
","
but
it
's
not
concerning
because
it
's
about
the
same
size
as
our
it
should
probably
be
at
least
a
little
smaller
","
which
is
simple
and
hard
because
everyone
knows
what
needs
to
be
done
(
higher
taxes
and
lower
spending
)
but
nobody
is
willing
to
do
it
but
much
like
needing
to
lose
weight
you
ca
n't
just
exercise
more
cut
calories

you
've
got
to
do
both
and
while
we
could
one
day
","
20
","
30
years
from
now
slowly
get
to
zero
with
modest
cuts
and
tax
hikes
","
we
do
n't
really
need
to
or
want
to
because
it
would
mean
lower
","
slower
economic
growth
as
a
nation
and
fewer
quality
investment
opportunities
for
individuals
and
businesses
yeah
","
you
could
","
but
it
would
be
immensely
stupid
","
given
that
the
value
of
money
always
drops
due
to
inflation
borrows
with
interest
rates
less
than
global
inflation
","
which
means
basically
makes
money
by
borrowing
money
when
the
dollar
loses
value
","
dollars
become
cheaper
that
is
when
large
chunks
will
be
paid
off
there
are
other
things
too
but
","
ya
it
could
be
that
there
is
good
debt

bad
debt
if
you
owe
me
50

do
n't

more

people

get
that

feeders

to
be
fair
if
someone
does

repay
their
debts

the
principle
amount

they

it

fiscally
profitable

anything

a
matter
of

sensing
sciences
","
which
we
can
not
(

yet

surmount

theory

that
it

impossible
to
know

principle
sounds
very
simple

it
is
really
","
really
counter
intuitive
to
understand
at
first
let
's
say
i
'm
at
the
top
of
a
tower
and
i
drop
a
book
without
really
looking
","
i
can
pretty
much
guess
it
's
position
after
1
second
","
given
it
's
size
","
weight
","
wind
speed
","
earth
's
gravity
pull
etc
etc
you
can
find
any
of
those
attributes
","
given
the
others
so
that
's
the
expectation
of
us
taking
stuff
from
the
macro
world
and
trying
to
apply
it
to
the
micro
world
moving
on
now
this
book
","
say
the
physicists
consists
of
atoms
","
and
those
atoms
consist
of
various
particles
so
you
may
think
ok
","
if
i
take
all
the
individual
particles
into
account
","
all
their
momentum
","
positions
","
enviromental
factors
etc
","
then
i
will
basically
be
able
to
predict
the
movent
in
the
macro
level
right
well
yes
that
's
*
*
if
you
can
do
that
*
's
uncertainty
principle
basically
says
*
*
you
ca
n't
really
know
everything
about
a
particle
at
any
given
time
if
you
predict
it
's
position
","
you
ca
n't
predict
it
's
momentum
and
the
more
accurate
you
can
predict
it
's
position
","
the
less
accurate
you
can
predict
it
's
momentum
(
and
vice

*
*
you
ca
n't
know
both
where
something
is

how
fast
it
