a

its
success

create
a
unique

populate
it
with
characters
we
can
root

it
's
still
relatable

we
all

it

Q
Q
school

is
one
of
the
more
awkward

miserable
times

rowling
offered
an
alternate

Q
i
think
the
franchise

success
came
from
the
fact

was
no

Q
the
quality

overreaching
success
Q
there
really
has
n't
been
a
story
quite
like
it
since
Q
it
's
largely
politics
Q
unions
tend
to
be
very
strong
supporters

the
Q
party
","
and
that
does
n't
sit
well
with
republicans
Q
but
","
for
some
specific
points
of
contention
Q
*
unions
fight
for
what
they
think
is
a
fair
wage
Q
some
people
think
that
wage
is
unreasonably
high
Q
*
unions
support
closed
shop
laws
","
which
make
it
illegal
to
hold
certain
jobs
if
you
're
not
in
a
union
Q
others
support
right
to
work
laws
","
because
they
do
n't
think
union
membership
should
be
mandatory
Q
*
in
theory
","
unions
work
for
better
conditions
for
workers
Q
however
","
some
unions
are
corrupt
","
linked
to
organized
crime
","
and
hold
nonunion
workers
in
contempt
Q
what
i
know
of
my
company
is
that
i
make
much
more
money
than
my
unionized
counterparts
at
other
company
locations
and
my
benefits
are
far
superior
Q
we
produce
a
larger
quantity
and
higher
quality
product
as
well
because
we
do
n't
have
senseless
union
red
tape
that
allows
us
to
perform
our
jobs
efficiently
Q
for
instance
if
my
line
is
down
because
of
an
electric
motor
and
there
are
4
bolts
that
mount
it
to
the
floor
Q
i
can
do
whatever
it
takes
to
compete
the
task
Q
in
a
union
shop
i
would
have
to
wait
for
an
available
mechanic
to
remove
any
bolts
or
fasteners
so
that
i
could
remove
the
wires
Q
if
i
were
to
do
it
myself
to
get
it
back
running
and
make
the
company
more
profitable
i
would
be
fined
or
fired
for
taking
work
from
another
worker
's
craft
and
violating
the
union
contract
Q
a
union
is
essentially
a
representative
that
sits
between
you
and
your
employer
when
it
comes
to
matters
such
as
hiring
(
workplace
agreements
and
wages
)
","
termination
(
fair
dismissal
","
severance
)
","
strikes
and
so
on
Q
for
workers
unions
are
usually
a
good
thing
","
because
the
union
represents
a
large
number
of
people
in
an
industry
they
're
in
a
good
position
to
negotiate
better
wages
and
working
conditions
than
any
individual
would
be
able
to
get
Q
the
union
will
also
represent
you
in
workplace
disputes
","
and
can
sometimes
provide
legal
representation
Q
unions
do
have
some
downsides
Q
for
example
if
there
are
non
Q
unioned
workers
in
an
industry
it
effectively
weakens
the
union
's
position
(
why
would
an
employer
agree
to
the
union
's
demands
when
they
can
just
hire
non
Q
union
people
instead
)
Q
therefore
in
some
industries
there
is
a
lot
of
pressure
on
workers
to
join
unions
Q
if
you
look
around
you
'll
find
stories
of
strong
Q
arm
tactics
or
even
open
hostility
Q
employers
also
find
unions
difficult
to
work
with
Q
an
employer
needs
to
consider
the
financial
situation
of
their
company
when
considering
things
like
wages
","
the
union
does
n't
have
the
same
concern
and
so
could
make
demands
greater
than
the
employer
can
cover
","
if
the
employer
does
n't
meet
the
demands
or
negotiate
them
down
then
they
risk
their
staff
going
on
strike
Q
the
pro
Q
union
counterargument
is
that
without
unions
the
employers
will
have
minimal
pressure
to
actually
raise
wages
","
and
that
factors
such
as
workplace
favouritism
could
end
up
with
two
employees
doing
the
same
work
for
different
amounts
of
pay
","
therefore
it
is
better
to
have
the
employer
and
the
union
negotiate
the
wage
for
everyone

might
be
in
sight

20
miles
away
and
still
be
in
a
chase
Q
the
ocean
is
endless
but
interesting
places
are
not
Q
i
'll
assume
here
that
the
sail
is
n't
on
the
horizon
and
we
're
starting
from
scratch
Q
write
a
letter
to
everyone
you
know

every
possible
port

ship
your
target
might
encounter
Q
then
make
copies
Q
leave
the
letters
for
the
packets
to
pick
up
Q
packets
were
small
","
robust
","
but
fairly
fast
ships
that
were
the
stagecoaches
of
the
day
Q
Q
bus
","
part
mail
service
","
and
always
smelly
and
cramped
Q
the
packets
would
run
a
route
picking
up
your
letters
and
dropping
them
off
at
the
destinations
Q
some
packets
would
n't
make
it
or
the
mail
would
simply
be
destroyed
enroute
Q
Q
is
why
you
made
copies
Q
other
times
the
packet
would
leave
a
letter
in
every
port
intended
for
a
specific
ship
Q
Q
is
why
you
made
copies
Q
with
luck
and
few
weeks
or
a
few
months
later
the
letters
would
be
read
Q
your
friends
write
back
and
describe
the
condition
of
the
ship
","
where
it
was
seen
","
and
what
activity
it
may
be
up
to
Q
Q
you
'll
read
weeks
or
months
later
Q
however
now
you
have
a
reasonable
idea
where
to
start
the
search
Q
if
the
ship
has
weed
on
the
hull
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
Q
if
the
ship
's
rigging
is
old
and
frayed
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
Q
if
the
ship
's
sails
are
thin
and
patched
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
Q
so
now
you
have
an
estimate
of
the
speed
Q
then
does
the
ship
have
enough
water
Q
is
the
ship
using
gunpowder
excessively
or
conservatively
Q
now
you
can
start
to
guess
how
well
supplied
the
ship
is
Q
this
gives
an
idea
of
intent
Q
once
the
search
region
is
known
then
it
's
all
about
guessing
where
the
ship
will
head
next
Q
does
the
ship
head
for
fresh
water
Q
does
the
ship
head
to
a
port
for
food
or
supplies
Q
does
the
ship
head
to
sea
for
mischief
Q
there
are
only
so
many
interesting
places
to
go
Q
the
most
direct
routes
between
these
places
form
routes
Q
guess
the
destination
and
either
get
there
first
or
attempt
to
intercept
the
ship
at
sea
between
destinations
Q
Q
for
days
or
weeks
Q
Q
right
and
the
sail
should
appear
on
the
horizon
Q
now
the
chase
begins
Q
the
winner
is
the
faster
ship
or
the
one
that
does
n't
make
the
mistake
Q
Q
","
such
as
with
the
weather
gauge

plays
a
huge
factor

who
chases

Q
Q
wrong

spend
the
next

weeks

the
process
Q
Q

mixing

thus
the
collective

in
this
case
","
the
material
absorbs
some
wavelengths

reflects
others
Q
no
new
wavelengths
are
added
Q
thus
mixing
colored

it

absorb
more
colors

fewer
wavelengths

think

additive
sources

Q
the
light
you
see

reflected

you
shine
green

you

mixing
red

yellow
lights

reflects
red

now
watch
me
get
accused

there

one
of
them

that
they

large

hate
on

Q
another
is
that
they
have
become
the
public
face

foods
Q
more
in
depth
reasons
involve
their
business
practices
which
forbid
the
replanting
of
seed
from
crops
owned
by
a
farmer
Q
many
view
this
as
an
injustice
which
greatly
harms
farmers
","
especially
small
farmers
who
may
not
be
able
to
afford
yearly
purchases
and
can
not
compete
with
the
yields
and
qualities
that
monsanto
seeds
allow
Q
the
final
one
that
i
'm
aware
of
is
that
monsanto
's
use
of
Q
technology
is
to
create
resistance
to
round
Q
up
and
other
pesticides
Q
this
has
two
implications
Q
the
first
ties
into
the
economic
harm
to
farmers
Q
it
obligates
those
who
use
monsanto
seeds
to
use
the
pesticides
monsanto
sells
and
allows
monsanto
even
more
control
of
their
market
Q
the
second
is
the
ecological
harm
that
may
be
caused
by
using
the
massive
quantities
of
pesticides
that
their
seeds
will
tolerate
Q
tl
Q
Q
lots
of
reasons
ranging
from
alarmist
wharrgarble
to
legitimate
economic
and
ecological
concerns
Q
yes
","
but
the
reason
why
it
is
darker
is
due
to
there
being
larger
sized
particles
in
the
clouds
Q
as
they
are
getting
closer
to
what
we
know
as
rain
Q
this
absorbs
light
differently
light
differently
","
thus
making
the
cloud
appear
darker
Q
it
is
just
water
particles
","
but
stormclouds
are
thicker
","
and
they
completely
block
out
the
sun
Q
when
it
's
raining
and
you
look
up
","
you
're
not
seeing
the
clouds
","
you
're
seeing
the
shadow

clouds
Q
the
clouds
are
thicker

thus
in
shadow
instead

glowing
with
refracted
sunlight
Q
the
tops
of
them
will
still
be

bright

white

you

just
need

cheery
bright

good

Q

"40,000"

inefficient

redesign
the

","
many
early
aviators

tried
adding
more

","
the
problem
with
this
was
making
sure

once

more
well
Q
understood
","
the
need
for
multiple
wings
declined
and
eventually
disappeared
Q
it
's
also
worth
noting
that
planes
with
multiple
sets
of
wings
can
have
problems
if
one
set
produces
much
more
lift

","

","
had
problems

the

much
more
lift

the
other
two
wings

the
top
wing
would
rip
itself
off

the

","
the
short
answer

that

with

the

what

the
answer
is
Q
not
much

it
's
tempting
to
think
that
evolution

useless
things

disappear
over
time
","
sort
of
like
a
genetic
atrophy

they
do
n't
work
that
way

something
has
to
specifically
select
Q
against

the
useless
feature

if
having
wisdom
teeth
made
people
less
attractive
","

raised
the
likelihood

them

then
we
could
postulate

evolutionary
pressure

larger
wisdom
teeth

that
","
over
time
","
more
and
more
people
with
smaller
wisdom
teeth

be
selected

a
gradual
evolutionary
decline

wisdom
teeth

since
that
's
not
the
case
","
they
're
here
to
stay
Q
an
analogue
to
help
cement
the
idea
would
be
the
appendix
Q
if
it
's
so
useless
and
so
(
potentially
)
lethal
","
why
do
we
still
have
it
Q
because
by
the
time
someone
's
appendix
becomes
inflamed
","
they
've
probably
already
had
kids
and
passed
the
genes
along
Q
if
the
median
age
for
appendicitis
over
the
last
couple
thousand
years
was
more
in
the
range
of
five
Q
years
Q
old
","
there
would
be
much
greater
selective
pressure
to
eliminate
it
Q
they
are
a
holdover
from
a
time
when
our
jaws
were
different
Q
prior
to
modern
dentistry
","
most
people
would
lose
some
teeth
or
grind
some
down
by
the
time
they
reached
adulthood
Q
so
it
was
helpful
to
have
some
extra
teeth
come
in
later
","
to
pick
up
the
slack
Q
they
're
only
a
problem
now
because
we
have
such
good
dental
hygiene
that
we
do
n't
lose
teeth
","
so
there
's
nowhere
for
the
wisdom
teeth
to
go
Q

those
are
the
people

live
in

desirable
neighborhoods

one
of

it
uses

when

there

we

our

an
example

","

the
smaller
size

the
odds

small
","

the
chance

hitting

cargo
ship

a
bit
higher
Q
secondly
","
there
are
not
nearly
as
many
recovery
ships
in
lakes
as
there
are
in
the
ocean
Q
if

only
a
few

guard

thirdly

the

Q
i
think
it
goes
without

that

really
anything

it
might
help
put
things
in
perspective

more
familiar
idea

can
grasp
Q
Q
of
the
problem

that
the
numbers

our

is
roughly

big

let

you
another
number

$
"17,000,000,000,000"
Q
why
","
yes
Q
that
is
the

number
Q
$
"17,000,000,000,000"

Q
Q
Q

is
what
our

produces
in

Q
of

Q
as

country

now
if
you
met
a
person

made
$
"170,000"
a
year
(
a
much
easier
number
to
get
your
head
around
)
and
that
person
was
in
debt
to
the
tune
of
$
"170,000"

with
a
house
a
couple
of
credit
cards
and
that
person
always
paid
all
of
his
bills
all
the
time
","
most
people
would
say
that
person
has
very
good
credit
and
is
n't
at
risk
of
going
bankrupt
and
would
likely
be
a
particularly
good
candidate
if
they
decided
to
get
another
loan
Q
and
so
long
as
their
income
grows
proportionally
with
their
debt
and
they
keep
paying
their
bills
","
they
'll
continue
to
be
a
safe
bet
to
continue
to
receive
loans
Q
in
other
words
","
if
their
debt
rose
to
$
"200,000"

that
'd
be
okay

their
income
was
also
in
the
neighborhood

$
"200,000"
Q
now
what
you
want
to
know
is
Q
can
the
debt
ever
be
repaid
Q
and
the
simple
answer
is
","
yes
","
but
you
would
n't
really
want
to
Q
keeping
our
house
metaphor
in
tact

the
time

","
if

wanted

get
out

we

difference

there
's
a
problem

what
do

cut

Q
Q
Q
Q
Q
Q
Q
Q
everything

're

more

we
could
nibble
around
the
edges

find
a
few

not
enough
to
make
a
really
big
difference

going
back

it
sounds
good

10
million

ketchup
research

$
6
million

pork

Q
is
n't
to
say
it
's
impossible
Q
just
about
20
years
ago
the
Q
administration
had
a
plan
to
pay
down
the
national
debt

raising
taxes

cutting
spending

according
to
that
plan

we
would
have
paid
off
the
national
debt

far
off
future

Q
unfortunately
","
when
we
went
to
war
in
Q
and
Q
in
2002
and
2003
","
that
added
expense
sidelined
the
debt
repayment
and
ballooned
our
debt
Q
and
then
in
2008
and
2009
the
financial
crisis
happened
and
various
stimulus
packages
and
tax
relief
packages
meant
our
debt
ballooned
again
Q
it
's
really
been
a
lousy
decade
for
debt
and
deficit
Q
but
have
no
fear
Q
should
we
do
the
obvious
yet
politically
suicidal
thing
of
raising
taxes
and
cutting
spending
we
can
get
our
debt
under
control
again
(
until
the
next
big
crisis
","
at
least
)
Q
but
we
do
n't
want
to
pay
it
off
","
mostly
because
a
lot
of
our
debt
is
n't
owned
by
foreign
countries

it
's
owned

people

at
the
intent

it
does
n't
really
make
much
difference
whether
the
silent

either
way
it

it

still
something

close

it

make
sense

give
it
the

protection

the
Q
and
especially
the
Q
of
rights
(
first
ten
amendments

outline
the
basic
rules
on
how
the
government
should
be
run
Q
more
than
rules

though
","
they
lay
out
a
basic
philosophy
on
what
's
most
important
(
freedom
of
speech

freedom

right
to
bear

Q
in
cases
that
deal
with
Q
issues

the

are
trying

determine

is
true

now

there
are
2

both
fixes

um
Q
not

Q
getting
the
game
on
steam
was
Q
luck
Q
magic
Q
no
Q
one
knew
how
it
worked

why

but
unless
you
were
being
published
by
the
likes
of
Q

Q
","
getting
your
game
on
steam
was
impossible
Q
this
basicly
culled
out
indies
Q
so
they
added
greenlight
as
a
sort
of
popularity
system
Q
it
got
abused
(
suprise
Q
)
and
so
they
went
back
to
the
drawing
board
Q
Q
they
added
early
Q
Q
(
which
seems
to
work
more
or
less
)
but
they
never
removed
greenlight
Q
which
they
stated
they
were
planning
on
removing
Q
so
we
'll
see
when
that
happens
Q
lastly
","
they
then
opened
the
gates
to
publishes

all
kinds

push
their
back
Q
log
catelogue
(

Q
their
bargain
bin
shit
)
to
steam
Q
which
resulted
in
steam
having
to
redesign
their
frontpage

took
them
6
months

yay

if

remember
right

Q
himself
said
on

that
he
is

it

he
wants
to
give
everyone
the
opportunity

sell
games
on
steam
without
any
voting
process
Q
that
's
why
my
guess
is
that
Q
is
just
a
stepping
stone
towards
a
system
that
allows
you
to
sell
games
on
steam
without
effort

to
try
out
if
such
a
system
could
work

in

it
will
make
money

in
the

all

will
be

does
so

refer

it
sounds
more
mature

real

i
get

to
be
fair

repay

they
ultimately
stole

counter

let
's

'm
at

i
drop
a
book

looking

i
can
pretty

's
gravity
pull

you
can
find

the
expectation

us
taking
stuff

macro
world

apply
it

the
micro
world

moving
on
Q
now
this
book
","
say
the
physicists
consists

atoms

those
atoms
consist

various
particles

you
may
think
Q
ok

if
i
take
all
the
individual
particles
into
account
","
all
their
momentum
","
positions
","
enviromental
factors

i
will
basically
be
able
to
predict
the
movent

level

well
Q
yes

that
's
*
*
if
you
can
do
that

Q
Q
Q
's
uncertainty
principle
basically
says
Q
*

you
ca
n't
really
know
everything
about
a
particle
at
any
given
time
Q
if
you
predict
it
's
position

you
ca
n't
predict
it
's
momentum
Q
and
the
more
accurate
you
can
predict

the
less
accurate
you
can
predict

momentum

you
ca
n't
know
both
where
something
