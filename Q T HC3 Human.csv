an
alternate

the

politics

to

Q
party
","
and
that
does
n't
sit
well
with
republicans
T
but
","
for
some
specific
points
of
contention
T
*
unions
fight
for
what
they
think
is
a
fair
wage
T
some
people
think
that
wage
is
unreasonably
high
T
*
unions
support
closed
shop
laws
","
which
make
it
illegal
to
hold
certain
jobs
if
you
're
not
in
a

T
others
support
right

laws

T
*
in
theory
","
unions
work

conditions
for
workers
T
however
","
some
unions
are
corrupt
","
linked
to
organized
crime
","
and
hold
nonunion
workers
in
contempt
T
what
i
know
of
my
company
is
that
i
make
much
more
money
than
my
unionized
counterparts
at
other
company
locations
and
my
benefits
are
far
superior
T
we
produce
a
larger
quantity
and
higher
quality
product
as
well
because
we
do
n't
have
senseless
union
red
tape
that
allows
us
to
perform
our
jobs
efficiently
T
for
instance
if
my
line
is
down
because
of
an
electric
motor
and
there
are
4
bolts
that
mount
it
to
the
floor
T
i
can
do
whatever
it
takes
to
compete
the
task
T
in
a
union
shop
i
would
have
to
wait
for
an
available
mechanic
to
remove
any
bolts
or
fasteners
so
that
i
could
remove
the
wires
T
if
i
were
to
do
it
myself
to
get
it
back
running
and
make
the
company
more
profitable
i
would
be
fined
or
fired
for
taking
work
from
another
worker
's
craft
and
violating
the
union
contract
T
a
union
is
essentially
a
representative
that
sits
between
you
and
your
employer
when
it
comes
to
matters
such
as
hiring
(
workplace
agreements
and
wages
)
","
termination
(
fair
dismissal
","
severance
)
","
strikes
and
so
on
T
for
workers
unions
are
usually
a
good
thing
","
because
the
union
represents
a
large
number
of
people
in
an
industry
they
're
in
a
good
position
to
negotiate
better
wages
and
working
conditions
than
any
individual
would
be
able
to
get
T
the
union
will
also
represent
you
in
workplace
disputes
","
and
can
sometimes
provide
legal
representation
T
unions
do
have
some
downsides
T
for
example
if
there
are
non
T
unioned
workers
in
an
industry
it
effectively
weakens
the
union
's
position
(
why
would
an
employer
agree
to
the
union
's
demands
when
they
can
just
hire
non
T
union
people
instead
)
T
therefore
in
some
industries
there
is
a
lot
of
pressure
on
workers
to
join
unions
T
if
you
look
around
you
'll
find
stories
of
strong
T
arm
tactics
or
even
open
hostility
T
employers
also
find
unions
difficult
to
work
with
T
an
employer
needs
to
consider
the
financial
situation
of
their
company
when
considering
things
like
wages
","
the
union
does
n't
have
the
same
concern
and
so
could
make
demands
greater
than
the
employer
can
cover
","
if
the
employer
does
n't
meet
the
demands
or
negotiate
them
down
then
they
risk
their
staff
going
on
strike
T
the
pro
T
union
counterargument
is
that
without
unions
the
employers
will
have
minimal
pressure
to
actually
raise
wages
","
and
that
factors
such
as
workplace
favouritism
could
end
up
with
two
employees
doing
the
same
work
for
different
amounts
of
pay
","
therefore
it
is
better
to
have
the
employer
and
the
union
negotiate
the
wage

everyone

might
be
in
sight
but
20
miles
away
and
still
be
in
a
chase
T
the
ocean
is
endless
but
interesting
places
are
not
T
i
'll
assume
here
that
the
sail
is
n't
on
the
horizon
and
we
're
starting
from
scratch
T
write
a
letter
to
everyone
you
know
to
every
possible
port
and
ship
your
target
might
encounter
T
then
make
copies
T
leave
the
letters
for
the
packets
to
pick
up
T
packets
were
small
","
robust
","
but
fairly
fast
ships
that
were
the
stagecoaches
of
the
day
T
Q
bus
","
part
mail
service
","
and
always
smelly
and
cramped
T
the
packets
would
run
a
route
picking
up
your
letters
and
dropping
them
off
at
the
destinations
T
some
packets
would
n't
make
it
or
the
mail
would
simply
be
destroyed
enroute
T
Q
is
why
you
made
copies
T
other
times
the
packet
would
leave
a
letter
in
every
port
intended
for
a
specific
ship
T
Q
is
why
you
made
copies
T
with
luck
and
few
weeks
or
a
few
months
later
the
letters
would
be
read
T
your
friends
write
back
and
describe
the
condition
of
the
ship
","
where
it
was
seen
","
and
what
activity
it
may
be
up
to
T
Q
you
'll
read
weeks
or
months
later
T
however
now
you
have
a
reasonable
idea
where
to
start
the
search
T
if
the
ship
has
weed
on
the
hull
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
T
if
the
ship
's
rigging
is
old
and
frayed
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
T
if
the
ship
's
sails
are
thin
and
patched
then
it
will
be
slow
and
easier
to
catch
T
so
now
you
have
an
estimate
of
the
speed
T
then
does
the
ship
have
enough
water
T
is
the
ship
using
gunpowder
excessively
or
conservatively
T
now
you
can
start
to
guess
how
well
supplied
the
ship
is
T
this
gives
an
idea
of
intent
T
once
the
search
region
is
known
then
it
's
all
about
guessing
where
the
ship
will
head
next
T
does
the
ship
head
for
fresh
water
T
does
the
ship
head
to
a
port
for
food
or
supplies
T
does
the
ship
head
to
sea
for
mischief
T
there
are
only
so
many
interesting
places
to
go
T
the
most
direct
routes
between
these
places
form
routes
T
guess
the
destination
and
either
get
there
first
or
attempt
to
intercept
the
ship
at
sea
between
destinations
T
Q
for
days
or
weeks
T
Q
right
and
the
sail
should
appear
on
the
horizon
T
now
the
chase
begins
T
the
winner
is
the
faster
ship
or
the
one
that
does
n't
make
the
mistake
T
Q
","
such
as
with
the
weather
gauge

plays
a
huge
factor

who

T
Q
wrong
and
spend
the
next
few
weeks

months
repeating
the
process
T
Q
routes
T
highways
on
the
sea
T
ships
were
flagged

country
and

mixing
light
together

simple
addition
T
Q

you
yellow

in
this
case

the
material
absorbs
some
wavelengths

reflects
others
T
no
new
wavelengths

added
T
thus
mixing
colored
paints

it
will
absorb
more
colors

fewer
wavelengths

reflected
back
T
if
mathematically
inclined

think
of
additive
sources

union

an
intersect
T
the
light
you
see
is
a
result
of
what
light
is
being
reflected
by
an
object
T
so
if
you
shine
green
with
red
","
you
see
yellow
in
light
T
but
paints
differ
in
the
color
they
absorb
T
so
mixing
red
(
which
absorbs
blue
and
yellow
lights
but
reflects
red
)
and
green
(
which
absorbs
red
and
reflects
blue
and
yellow
)
together
gives
you
something
that

blue

yellow
T
if
they

perfectly
opposed

you
'd
make
black

up

now
watch
me
get
accused

shill

there
are
several
reasons

one
of
them
is
that
they

large

to
hate
on

T
another
is
that
they

T
more
in
depth
reasons
involve
their
business
practices
which
forbid
the
replanting
of
seed
from
crops
owned
by
a
farmer
T
many
view
this
as
an
injustice
which
greatly
harms
farmers
","
especially
small
farmers

may
not
be
able
to
afford
yearly
purchases

can
not
compete
with
the
yields
and
qualities
that
monsanto
seeds
allow
T
the
final
one
that
i
'm
aware
of
is
that
monsanto
's
use
of
Q
technology
is
to
create
resistance
to
round
T
up
and
other
pesticides
T
this
has
two
implications
T
the
first
ties
into
the
economic
harm
to
farmers
T
it
obligates
those
who
use
monsanto
seeds
to
use
the
pesticides
monsanto
sells
and
allows
monsanto
even
more
control
of
their
market
T
the
second
is
the
ecological
harm
that
may
be
caused
by
using
the
massive
quantities
of
pesticides
that
their
seeds
will
tolerate
T
tl
T
Q
lots
of
reasons
ranging
from
alarmist
wharrgarble
to
legitimate
economic
and
ecological
concerns
T
yes
","
but
the
reason
why
it
is
darker
is
due
to
there
being
larger
sized
particles
in
the
clouds
T
as
they
are
getting
closer
to
what
we
know
as
rain
T
this
absorbs
light
differently
light
differently
","
thus
making
the
cloud
appear
darker
T
it
is
just
water
particles

but
stormclouds

thicker

and
they
completely
block
out
the
sun

when
it

you
look
up

the
tops

's

postulate

that
","
over

more
and
more
people

smaller
wisdom
teeth

be
selected

a

evolutionary
decline

that
's
not
the
case
","
they
're
here

stay
T
an
analogue
to
help
cement
the
idea

be
the
appendix

if
it
's
so
useless

so
(
potentially
)
lethal
","
why
do
we
still
have
it
T
because
by
the
time
someone
's
appendix
becomes
inflamed

they
've
probably
already
had
kids

passed
the
genes
along
T
if
the
median
age
for
appendicitis
over
the
last
couple
thousand
years
was
more
in
the
range

five
T
years
T
old
","
there
would
be
much
greater
selective
pressure
to
eliminate
it
T
they
are
a
holdover
from
a
time
when
our
jaws
were
different
T
prior

modern
dentistry
","
most
people
would
lose
some
teeth

grind
some
down

the
time
they
reached
adulthood

so
it
was
helpful
to
have
some
extra
teeth
come
in
later

to
pick
up
the
slack

they
're
only
a
problem
now

we
have
such
good
dental
hygiene

we
do
n't
lose
teeth

so
there
's
nowhere
for
the
wisdom

live

the

the
chance

secondly
","
there
are
not

ships

good
candidate

what
you
want

T
can
the

be

the
simple

just
about
20
years

a
plan

pay
down

national

when
we
went
to
war

Q
in

that
added
expense
sidelined
the
debt
repayment

ballooned
our
debt

and
then
in
2008
and
2009
the
financial
crisis
happened
and
various
stimulus
packages
and
tax
relief
packages
meant
our
debt
ballooned
again
T
it
's
really
been
a
lousy
decade
for
debt
and
deficit
T
but
have
no
fear
T
should
we
do
the
obvious
yet
politically
suicidal
thing
of
raising
taxes
and
cutting
spending
we
can
get
our
debt
under
control
again
(
until
the
next
big
crisis
","
at
least
)
T
but
we
do
n't
want
to
pay
it
off

because

basic
rules

more
than

lay
out

getting
your

was

T
this
basicly
culled
out
indies

so
they
added
greenlight

a
sort

popularity
system

it
got
abused
(
suprise
T
)

so
they
went
back

the

Q

added
early

(

seems
to
work

they
never
removed
greenlight

we
'll
see

wants

give

the
opportunity

any
voting
process

that
's
why
my
guess
is
that
Q
is
just
a
stepping
stone
towards
a
system
that
allows
you
to
sell
games

effort

to
try
out

such
a
system
could
work

get
