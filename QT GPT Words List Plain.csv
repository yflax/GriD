introduction
T
Q
school
days
have
become
a
controversial
issue
as
of
late
T
while
some
argue
that
extending
school
days
would
have
educational
and
social
benefits
","
i
am
against
the
idea
of
adding
one
and
a
half
hour
to

days
T
this
essay

detail
four
main
reasons
why
this
should
not
be

T
Q
1
T
we
are
already
in
school
for
8
hours

it
is
too
much
T
Q
hours
is
already
a
long
time
to
spend
in
school
T
times
are
different
since
the
introduction
of
digital
devices
in
education
","
and
children
may
struggle
to
focus
on
tasks

activities
so
long
into
the
day
T
as
their
brains
tire
","
so
does
their
capacity
for
learning.reason
2
T
we
do
n't
have
enough
time
for
personal
activities
T
having
a
longer
school
day
would
mean
less
free
time
in
the
afternoon
for
students
to
learn
valuable
activities
","
like
how
to
manage
their
finances
","
pursue
hobbies
","
cooking
","
time
with
family
","
and
much
more
T
Q
3
T
too
much
homework
T
having
a
longer
school
day
means
more
homework
for
students
and
puts
greater
pressure
on
them
T
even
if
teachers
spread
out
assignments
and
give
manageable
homework
","
a
longer
school
day
will
result
in
massive
piles
of
assignments
T
Q
4
T
appointments

missed
T
students

their
families
may
find
it
almost
impossible
to
juggle
appointments

medical
","
and
a
range
of
other
services
in

around

longer
school
day

such
appointments
are
crucial
","
and
an
impossibly
long
school
day
could
lead
to
missed
opportunities

numerous
students
T
in
conclusion
","
i
believe
the
idea
of
adding
another
one
and
a
half
hours
to

be
abandoned
in

shorter
days

better
educational
methods
T
the
additional
time
taken
up
by

school
days

unnecessary

detrimental
consequences

highlighted

beauty

importance

the
heavy
reliance

be
detrimental

mental

the

the

increase

lead

difficult

add
additional
strain

more
material

frames.in

fewer

work
hours

primary
instructors
being
asked

take
on
additional
roles

school

this
would
detract

complex
tasks

fewer
work
hours.lastly
","
reducing
the
amount
of
time
teachers
spend
in
the
classroom
could
unintentionally
devalue
the
profession
as
a
whole
T
teachers
dedicate
a
great
deal
of
time
to
their
work

","
by
painting
it

something

short

we
risk
giving
the
impression

less
worthy
profession

less

reasons

not

my
essay

about
a
situation

junior
in

school

had
been
very
interested

the
school

theater
department

but
i
was
too
intimidated
to
audition

any
shows
T
i
knew
that
if
i
auditioned
","
i
would
likely
be
cast
in
a
smaller
role
","
and
i
was
afraid
i
would
n't
do
well
enough
T
i
talked
to
a
close
friend

was
very
passionate
about
theater

i
could
see
that
they
wanted
to
encourage
me
to
audition
","
but
i
could
n't
work
up
the
courage
to
actually
do
it
T
i
believe
the
reason
i
was
unsuccessful
with
participating
in
the
school
theater
productions
was
because
i
was
afraid
of
failure
and
i
did
n't
have
enough
confidence

my
own
abilities

my
lack
of
self-confidence
kept
me
from
taking
action

me

fulfilling

potential
passion

pushed
myself

decision

the
risk

auditioning

gained

often

the
precursor

Q
Q

famously
quoted

remarking

is
the
courage

continue
that
counts.
”
this
simple
quotation
succinctly
illustrates
an
important
truth-
failure
should
not
be
feared
","

embraced
T
it
is
difficult
to
succeed

first
having
failed

important

Q
","
failure
can
often
provide
valuable
insight

the
knowledge

gains

failing

help
them

better

themselves

success

example
","
Q
Q
famously
remarked
that
failure
taught
him
a
thousand
ways
not
to
build
a
lightbulb
T
this
perspective
allowed
him
to
look
at
each
instance
of
failure
as
a
lesson
","
rather
than
an
impediment
to
success
T
another
example
of
this
notion
is
when
Q
Q
failed
a
major
quiz
in
high
school
T
Q
originally
considering
it
a
disappointment
","
Q
remarked
later
that
“
it
was
the
best
thing
”
","

it
changed
her
attitude
towards
learning

inspired
her
to
take
courses

was
genuinely
passionate

","
failure

provide
an
emotional
sense

resilience

is
necessary

T
those
that

effectively
learn

mistakes

failures

source

resilient

example

this
","
Q
Q
was
famously
cut
from

team

through
hard
work

dedication

became

basketball

a
concept

the
controversy

Q

complex

multifaceted

there
are
valid
arguments
on
both
sides

there
are
a
few
reasons
why
we
might
not
have
high
resolution
color
cameras
on
some
space
probes

T
one
reason
is
that
these
devices
often
need
to
be
small
and
lightweight
in
order
to
be
launched
into
space
T
adding
a
high
resolution
color
camera
would
add
extra
weight
and
complexity
to
the
design
","
which
could
make
it
more
difficult
and
expensive
to
launch
T
another
reason
is
that
the
cameras
need
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
harsh
conditions
of
space
","
including
extreme
temperatures
","
radiation
","
and
micrometeoroid
impacts
T
these
conditions
can
be
tough
on
electronic
devices
","
so
the
cameras
need
to
be
robust
and
reliable
in
order
to
function
properly
T
finally
","
it
can
also
be
expensive
to
design
and
build
high
resolution
color
cameras
that
are
specifically
designed
for
use
in
space
T
there
are
also
many
other
scientific
instruments

sensors
that
are
needed
on
these
probes

satellites

so
there
may
not
be
enough
room

resources

include

high
resolution
color
camera

explain

the

reason

","
the
cost
of
sending

also
be
lower

transcripts
typically
contain
more
information

single
Q
score

be
more
expensive
for
the
organization

process

transmit
this
additional
information

one
reason

in

languages

all
nouns

either

T
the
notion

the
Q
's
rejection
of

be
attributed
to
several
factors
T
the
belief

not
a
widely
held
belief

the
concept

be
