three
index

keep
track

store

the

enters
a
loop

a

the
loop
ends

the
program
moves

calculating
the
average

the

method
is
used
to
validate
the
rating
entered
by
the
user
T
if
the
rating
is
valid

the
program
stores
it

appropriate
array

the

prompts
the

enter
a

once

the
program
uses
a
recursive
algorithm

calculate
the
average
rating

product

the
calculateaverage
(
)
method
takes
an
array
","
an
index

a
sum
as
parameters
T
the
index
variable

used

iterate

the
sum
variable

used
to
keep
track

total
sum

array
T
the
method
adds
each
rating

the
sum
if
it
is
not
equal
to
0
(
which
indicates
an
empty
slot

those

Q
the
use
of
square
boxes
for
pizza
packaging
can
be
traced
back
to
the
origins
of
pizza
delivery
in
the
Q
states
T
in
the
1960s
","
pizza
began
to
gain
popularity
as
a
convenient
and
affordable
meal
option
","
and
many
pizza
restaurants
began
offering
delivery
services
T
the
square
pizza
box
was
introduced
as
a
practical
and
efficient
way
to
transport
multiple
pizzas
at
once
","
as
they
could
be
stacked
easily
on
top
of
each
other
without
damaging
the
pizzas.the
square
shape
of
pizza
boxes
also
made
them
easier
to
store
in
delivery
vehicles
and
on
shelves
","
as
they
could
be
neatly
arranged
in
rows
T
additionally
","
the
flat
shape
of
the
box
made
it
easier
to
cut
and
serve
the
pizza
directly
from
the
box
","
without
needing
to
transfer
it
onto
a
separate
plate.in
terms
of
cultural
background
","
pizza
has
become
a
ubiquitous
part
of
american
cuisine
and
is
often
associated
with
casual
","
family-friendly
dining
T
the
square
shape
of
the
pizza
box
reflects
this
casual
and
practical
nature
","
as
it
is
designed
for
easy
and
convenient
use
in
a
variety
of
settings.other
shapes
of
pizza
boxes
","
such
as
round
or
triangular
boxes
","
have
also
been
used
in
the
past
","
but
they
are
less
common
T
Q
pizza
boxes
were
popular
in
the
1980s
and
1990s
and
were
designed
to
accommodate
the
increasingly
popular
trend
of
deep-dish
pizzas
T
however
","
the
round
shape
made
them
less
practical
for
stacking
and
storage
","
and
they
have
largely
fallen
out
of
use.triangular
pizza
boxes
","
on
the
other
hand
","
are
often
used
for
novelty
or
specialty
pizzas
","
such
as
those
with
unique
toppings
or
shapes
T
they
are
also
popular
in
some
european
countries
where
pizzas
are
typically
cut
into
slices
rather
than
squares
T
however

they
