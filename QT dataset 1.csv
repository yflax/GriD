three
index

keep
track

store

the

enters
a
loop

rate

a
rating

product

the
loop
ends

the
program
moves

calculating
the
average

the

method
is
used
to
validate
the
rating
entered
by
the
user
T
if
the
rating
is
valid

the
program
stores
it

appropriate
array

the
program
displays

prompts
the

enter
a

once

the
program
uses
a
recursive
algorithm

calculate
the
average
rating

product

the
calculateaverage
(
)
method
takes
an
array
","
an
index

a
sum
as
parameters
T
the
index
variable

used

iterate

the
sum
variable

used
to
keep
track

total
sum

array
T
the
method
adds
each
rating

the
sum
if
it
is
not
equal
to
0
(
which
indicates
an
empty
slot

those
