Historical

a
humorous
exaggeration

some
degree
of
self-governance

it
is
incorrect
to
portray
them
as
completely
autonomous

their
noble
lords

Bread
in

wheat

flour

The
way

often
introduced

historical
events

figures

simplified
manner

Another
reason
is
the
evolving
understanding
of
history
Historical
research

emerge
The
tradition
of
placing
coins
in

The
practice

began

Egyptian

The

are
several
reasons

Power
plants

developed
specialized
respiratory
systems

The
estimate
that
we

only
discovered
about

all
living
species
is
based
on
scientific
studies

","
have
a
deep
understanding
of

they
can
identify
gaps

to
note
that
the

influenced
by
several
factors

including
wind
speed

vision
Firstly
","
eagles
have
eyes
that
are
larger

more
light
to

gives
them
better

The
reason
small

due

Anatomy
Animals

their
throat

digestive
system
that
make
it
easier
for
them
to
consume
fish
bones

","
so
every

it
falls
behind

a
tiny
bit
","
like
minutes
Over
the
course
of
a
single
day
","
those
minutes

minutes
behind

it

roughly
hours
and

behind
When
blood
comes
into
contact
with
your
skin
","
it
does
n't
stick
like
a
permanent
marker
because
your
skin
has
a
natural
barrier
called
the
stratum
corneum
This
layer

acts
as
a
protective
barrier

prevents
substances

Small
animals
like
squirrels
have
adapted
to
survive
in
cold
temperatures
without
losing
their
appendages
to
frostbite
Here
's
how
it
works:1
Fur
Squirrels
have
a
thick
coat
of
fur
that
acts
as
insulation
It
helps
to
trap
warm
air
close
to
their
bodies

prevents
heat
loss
This
fur
layer

When

to
oats
","
the
term

Steel-cut
oats

made
by

blades
This
differs
from
other
types

instant
oats
","
which
are
processed
differently
The
reason
why

composition
When

The
restaurant
industry
did
not
convince
the
American
population
to
pay
their
employees
rather
","
it
is
a
result
of
the
way
the
industry
operates
and
the
laws
surrounding
it
In
the
States
","
the
restaurant
industry
operates
under
a
system
called
the
tipped
minimum
wage
This
means
that
employers
are
allowed
to
pay
their
tipped
employees
(
like
waitstaff
)
a
lower
hourly
wage
with
the
expectation
that
tips
from
customers
will
make
up
the
difference
and
bring
their
earnings
up
to
at
least
the
regular
minimum
wage
there
are
many
different
best
seller
lists
that
are
published
by
various
organizations
and
the
is
just
one
of
them
the
best
seller
list
is
a
weekly
list
that
ranks
the
best selling
books
in
the
states
based
on
sales
data
from
a
number
of
different
retailers
the
list
is
published
in
the
newspaper
and
is
widely
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
influential
best
seller
lists
in
the
book
industry
it
s
important
to
note
that
the
best
seller
list
is
not
the
only
best
seller
list
out
there
and
there
are
many
other
lists
that
rank
the
top selling
books
in
different
categories
or
in
different
countries
so
it
s
possible
that
a
book
could
be
a
best
seller
on
one
list
but
not
on
another
additionally
the
term
best
seller
is
often
used
more
broadly
to
refer
to
any
book
that
is
selling
well
regardless
of
whether
it
is
on
a
specific
best
seller
list
or
not
so
it
s
possible
that
you
may
hear
about
a
book
being
a
best
seller
even
if
it
is
not
specifically
ranked
as
a
number
one
best
seller
on
the
list
or
any
other
list
is
used
on
roads
to
help
melt
ice
and
snow
and
improve
traction
during
the
winter
months
when
it
s
cold
outside
water
can
freeze
on
the
roads
and
make
them
very
slippery
which
can
be
dangerous
for
cars
and
people
helps
to
melt
the
ice
and
snow
by
lowering
the
freezing
point
of
water
which
means
that
it
can
help
keep
the
roads
clear
and
safe
to
travel
on
there
are
other
options
for
melting
ice
and
snow
on
roads
such
as
using
chemicals
like
calcium
chloride
or
magnesium
chloride
or
using
mechanical
methods
like
plows
or
sand
however
salt
is
often
the
most
effective
and
affordable
option
for
many
communities
especially
when
it
s
used
in
combination
with
other
methods
it
s
important
to
note
that
while
salt
can
be
helpful
for
making
roads
safer
during
the
winter
it
can
also
have
negative
effects
on
the
environment
and
on
the
cars
themselves
can
cause
corrosion
on
metal
surfaces
including
cars
and
it
can
also
harm
plants
and
animals
if
it
washes
into
nearby
waterways
however
despite
these
potential
downsides
many
communities
continue
to
use
salt
as
a
way
to
keep
roads
clear
and
safe
during
the
winter
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
we
still
have
standard
definition
tv
channels
some
people
still
use
older
tvs
that
are
not
compatible
with
high
definition
signals
these
tvs
can
only
display
channels
so
if
we
only
had
channels
those
people
would
n t
be
able
to
watch
tv
channels
take
up
more
bandwidth
than
channels
so
it
s
not
possible
to
have
as
many
channels
as
we
have
channels
this
means
that
if
we
only
had
channels
some
channels
might
not
be
available
channels
also
require
more
expensive
equipment
to
produce
so
some
tv
stations
might
not
be
able
to
afford
to
upgrade
to
it
s
important
to
have
both
and
channels
so
that
everyone
can
watch
tv
regardless
of
what
kind
of
tv
they
have
or
how
much
money
they
have
it
is
generally
not
acceptable
or
ethical
to
advocate
for
or
condone
the
assassination
of
any
individual
regardless
of
their
actions
or
beliefs
there
are
also
practical
considerations
at
play
in
this
situation
and
foremost
it
is
important
to
remember
that
assassination
is
a
violent
and
extreme
act
that
can
have
serious
consequences
both
for
the
person
being
targeted
and
for
those
around
them
it
can
also
lead
to
further
conflict
and
instability
in
the
region
additionally
the
north
korean
government
is
known
for
being
highly
secretive
and
heavily
guarded
making
it
difficult
for
outsiders
to
carry
out
such
an
action
there
may
also
be
legal
and
diplomatic
implications
for
any
country
or
individual
that
attempts
to
assassinate
the
leader
of
another
sovereign
state
it
is
important
to
seek
peaceful
and
diplomatic
solutions
to
conflicts
and
differences
rather
than
resorting
to
violence
and
assassination
after
the
brothers
made
the
first
powered
flight
in
people
all
around
the
world
became
interested
in
building
and
flying
airplanes
many
people
started
working
on
designing
and
building
airplanes
and
as
a
result
airplane
technology
began
to
advance
quickly
one
reason
for
this
rapid
advancement
was
the
fact
that
airplanes
were
very
useful
for
a
number
of
different
purposes
for
example
airplanes
were
used
for
transportation
for
carrying
mail
for
crop
dusting
and
for
military
purposes
this
meant
that
there
was
a
lot
of
demand
for
airplanes
which
in
turn
encouraged
more
people
to
work
on
developing
and
improving
airplane
technology
during
i
airplanes
became
even
more
important
because
they
were
used
for
fighting
in
the
war
this
led
to
even
more
rapid
development
of
airplane
technology
as
people
tried
to
build
airplanes
that
were
faster
more
maneuverable
and
more
durable
so
in
short
the
reason
that
airplane
technology
was
able
to
advance
so
quickly
was
because
there
was
a
lot
of
interest
in
airplanes
and
a
lot
of
people
working
on
developing
and
improving
them
this
was
especially
true
during
i
when
the
need
for
effective
military
airplanes
was
particularly
pressing
the
color
of
your
eyes
is
determined
by
the
amount
and
type
of
pigments
in
your
iris
which
is
the
colored
part
of
your
eye
and
by
the
way
that
the
iris
scatters
light
the
iris
contains
two
types
of
pigment
one
called
melanin
which
gives
your
skin
hair
and
eyes
their
color
and
another
called
lipochrome
which
is
a
yellowish
pigment
the
combination
of
these
pigments
along
with
the
structure
of
the
iris
determines
the
color
of
your
eyes
there
are
many
different
shades
of
eye
color
ranging
from
dark
brown
to
light
blue
and
the
most
common
eye
colors
are
brown
blue
and
green
the
color
of
your
eyes
is
determined
by
your
genes
which
are
the
instructions
that
you
inherit
from
your
parents
that
tell
your
body
how
to
grow
and
function
there
is
no
scientific
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
color
of
your
eyes
has
any
special
meaning
or
significance
however
many
people
believe
that
the
color
of
your
eyes
can
reveal
certain
things
about
your
personality
or
your
health
but
these
beliefs
are
not
supported
by
scientific
evidence
in
short
the
color
of
your
eyes
is
simply
a
result
of
the
combination
of
pigments
and
the
way
that
light
is
scattered
by
your
iris
and
it
has
no
special
meaning
or
significance
the
to
the
states
protects
the
freedom
of
religion
which
means
that
you
have
the
right
to
believe
and
practice
whatever
religion
you
choose
however
this
freedom
is
not
absolute
and
can
be
limited
in
certain
circumstances
to
protect
the
rights
and
safety
of
others
in
the
case
you
described
going
to
school
is
not
a
matter
of
personal
belief
or
religious
practice
it
is
a
legal
requirement
for
children
of
a
certain
age
to
attend
school
in
order
to
receive
an
education
by
not
going
to
school
you
would
be
breaking
the
law
and
could
be
charged
for
truancy
or
failing
to
comply
with
compulsory
education
laws
even
if
you
tried
to
claim
that
your
religion
prevents
you
from
going
to
school
the
government
has
the
right
to
regulate
certain
activities
that
could
interfere
with
the
education
of
children
or
the
functioning
of
schools
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
ensuring
that
children
receive
a
proper
education
and
the
does
not
protect
actions
that
would
disrupt
or
interfere
with
this
important
goal
so
while
you
have
the
right
to
freely
practice
your
religion
you
still
have
to
follow
the
laws
and
regulations
that
apply
to
everyone
else
including
those
related
to
education
there
are
a
few
different
factors
that
can
contribute
to
the
trend
of
throwing
away
products
instead
of
fixing
them
one
factor
is
the
quality
of
the
products
themselves
some
products
are
designed
in
a
way
that
makes
them
difficult
or
impossible
to
repair
for
example
if
a
product
is
made
with
very
cheap
materials
or
is
put
together
in
a
way
that
makes
it
hard
to
access
the
parts
that
need
to
be
repaired
it
may
be
easier
or
cheaper
to
just
throw
it
away
and
buy
a
new
one
rather
than
try
to
fix
it
another
factor
is
cultural
in
origin
in
some
societies
it
is
more
common
or
acceptable
to
throw
away
things
that
are
broken
or
no
longer
wanted
rather
than
trying
to
repair
them
or
give
them
to
someone
else
who
might
be
able
to
use
them
this
can
be
influenced
by
things
like
the
availability
of
cheap
new
products
and
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
just
buy
a
new
item
instead
of
trying
to
fix
the
old
one
finally
in
some
cases
the
cost
of
repairing
a
product
might
be
more
expensive
than
buying
a
new
one
this
can
happen
if
the
product
is
very
old
or
if
the
parts
needed
to
fix
it
are
hard
to
find
or
very
expensive
in
these
cases
it
might
make
more
sense
to
just
buy
a
new
product
instead
of
trying
to
repair
the
old
one

prions
are
tiny
particles
that
can
cause
serious
and
often
fatal
diseases
in
people
and
animals
they
are
made
up
of
proteins
which
are
important
building
blocks
in
the
body
normally
proteins
have
a
specific
shape
that
helps
them
do
their
job
but
prions
are
abnormal
proteins
that
have
a
different
shape
and
they
can
cause
other
proteins
around
them
to
change
shape
too
when
this
happens
it
can
cause
problems
in
the
body
because
the
proteins
are
not
able
to
work
properly
prions
are
not
viruses
and
they
do
not
contain
any
genetic
material
like
or
like
viruses
do
instead
they
are
thought
to
be
able
to
change
the
shape
of
proteins
by
acting
as
a
kind
of
template
for
other
proteins
to
copy
prion
diseases
can
be
very
serious
and
are
often
fatal
some
examples
of
prion
diseases
include
creutzfeldt jakob
disease
in
humans
and
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
also
known
as
mad
cow
disease
in
cows
these
diseases
can
be
transmitted
through
contaminated
food
or
medical
equipment
but
they
can
also
occur
spontaneously
in
some
people
there
is
currently
no
cure
for
prion
diseases
and
they
can
be
difficult
to
diagnose
researchers
are
working
to
better
understand
how
prions
cause
disease
and
to
find
ways
to
prevent
and
treat
these
conditions
a
hacker
is
someone
who
uses
their
computer
skills
to
try
to
gain
access

without

hackers
might
do
this
for
a
variety
of
reasons
such
as
to
steal
information
to
cause
damage
or
disruption
or
just
for
the
challenge
of

hacking
can
involve
a

this
can
involve
a

of

which
is
why
hackers
might
seem
to
be
jamming
on
their

as
they
try
different

overall
hacking
can
be
a
complex
and
technical
activity
that
requires
a
lot
of
knowledge
and
skill
hackers
might
use
a
wide
range
of
techniques
and
tools
to
try
to
achieve
their

a
medical
condition
that
affects
the
way
you
feel
it
can
be
caused
by
a
combination
of
physical
psychological
and
environmental
factors
in
the
brain
depression
is
thought
to
be
caused
by
an
imbalance
of
certain
chemicals
called
neurotransmitters
these
chemicals
help
transmit
messages
between
nerve
cells
in
the
brain
when
there
is
an
imbalance
of
neurotransmitters
it
can
affect
your
mood
and
behavior
symptoms
of
depression
can
be
both
physical
and
psychological
physical
symptoms
may
include
changes
in
appetite
and
sleep
patterns
fatigue
and
body
aches
symptoms
may
include
feeling
sad
or
hopeless
losing
interest
in
activities
you
used
to
enjoy
and
difficulty
concentrating
it
s
important
to
note
that
everyone
experiences
depression
differently
and
treatment
may
involve
a
combination
of
therapy
medication
and
lifestyle
changes
if
you
think
you
or
someone
you
know
may
be
experiencing
depression
it
s
important
to
speak
with
a
healthcare
provider
for
a
proper
evaluation
and
treatment
plan
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
movie
companies
might
choose
to
build
sets
rather
than
film
on
location
control
building
a
set
allows
the
filmmakers
to
have
complete
control
over
the
look
and
feel
of
the
environment
in
which
they
are
shooting
this
can
be
especially
important
if
the
story
takes
place
in
a
fantastical
or
fictional
world
or
if
the
filmmakers
want
to
create
a
specific
mood
or
atmosphere
cost
while
it
may
seem
like
it
would
be
cheaper
to
film
on
location
this
is
not
always
the
case
renting
a
location
can
be
expensive
especially
if
the
filmmakers
need
to
use
it
for
an
extended
period
of
time
additionally
the
filmmakers
may
need
to
pay
to
use
certain
locations
or
they
may
have
to
pay
to
have
the
location
altered
in
some
way
to
suit
their
needs
logistics
filming
on
location
can
also
be
logistically
challenging
the
filmmakers
may
need
to
deal
with
crowds
noise
and
other
distractions
which
can
make
it
difficult
to
get
the
shots
they
need
additionally
the
filmmakers
may
not
have
access
to
all
of
the
resources
they
need
on
location
such
as
electricity
water
or
special
equipment
safety
finally
building
a
set
can
be
safer
for
the
cast
and
crew
filming
on
location
can
involve
dealing
with
hazards
such
as
traffic
unstable
terrain
or
inclement
weather
by
building
a
set
the
filmmakers
can
create
a
controlled
environment
where
these
hazards
are
minimized
overall
building
sets
can
be
more
expensive
upfront
but
it
can
also
be
more
cost effective
in
the
long
run
as
it
allows
the
filmmakers
to
have
greater
control
over
their
shooting
environment
and
reduce
the
risk
of
delays
or
unexpected
costs

a
group
of
computers

to
prevent
unauthorized

there
are
many
different
ways
that
can

implemented
but
generally
it
works
by
encrypting
the

and
requiring
users
to
authenticate
themselves
before
they
can
access
it
for
example
if
you

you
may
need
to
enter
a
special

it
can
make
it
more
difficult
for
people
to
use
the

that
they
have
purchased
in
the
way
that
they
want
to
for
example
if
you
buy

and
it
has
drm
on

you
may
not
be
able
to
play
it
on
all
of
your

or
you
may
have
to
jump
through
some
hoops
to
get
it
to

this
can
be
frustrating
for
users
especially
if
they
feel
like
they
are
paying
for
something
that
they
ca

there
are
also
concerns
about
being
used
to
track
users
or
limit
their
freedom
to
use
the
content
in
certain
ways
some
people
believe
that
is
unnecessary
and
that
it
does
more
harm
than
good
while
others
argue
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the

it

dogs
bark
for
a
variety
of
reasons
such
as
to
alert
their
owners
of
something
to
communicate
with
other
dogs
or
to
express
excitement
or
frustration
some
dogs
are
more
prone
to
barking
than
others
and
some
breeds
are
known
for
being
more
vocal
than
others
people
can
only
scream
for
a
short
period
of
time
because
our
bodies
are
not
built
to
handle
the
strain
of
screaming
for
long
periods
of
time
screaming
uses
a
lot
of
energy
and
can
be
very
tiring
which
is
why
people
can
only
do
it
for
a
short
period
of
time
before
they
need
to
rest
on
the
other
hand
are
built
differently
and
are
able
to
bark
for
longer
periods
of
time
without
getting
as
tired
dogs
also
have
different
vocal
cords
than
humans
which
may
make
it
easier
for
them
to
bark
for
longer
periods
of
time
without
damaging
their
vocal
cords
it
s
important
for
countries
just
like
people
to
manage
their
debts
responsibly
if
a
country
has
too
much
debt
it
can
be
difficult
for
it
to
borrow
money
in
the
future
and
investors
may
be
less
likely
to
lend
it
money
this
can
make
it
harder
for
the
country
to
fund
things
like
infrastructure
education
and
healthcare
if
a
country
is
not
able
to
pay
off
its
debts
it
could
default
on
its
loans
this
means
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
required
payments
to
its
lenders
and
could
potentially
lead
to
financial
problems
for
the
country
it
s
important
for
countries
to
try
to
pay
off
their
debts
but
it
s
not
always
possible
to
do
it
all
at
once
instead
they
might
make
a
plan
to
gradually
pay
off
their
debts
over
time
this
is
called
a
debt
repayment
plan
in
the
case
of
the
states
the
government
has
a
lot
of
debt
but
it
also
has
a
strong
economy
and
is
able
to
borrow
money
at
low
interest
rates
this
means
that
it
can
afford
to
pay
back
its
debts
over
time
however
it
s
still
important
for
the
government
to
be
careful
about
how
much
it
borrows
and
to
try
to
live
within
its
means
as
much
as
possible
it
s
important
to
note
that
not
all
republicans
are
against
giving
the
community
equality
in
fact
many
republicans
support
equal
rights
for
the
community
however
there
are
some
conservatives
who
may
not
support
equal
rights
for
the
community
for
a
variety
of
reasons
one
reason
may
be
due
to
their
religious
beliefs
some
conservatives
may
believe
that
being
gay
lesbian
bisexual
or
transgender
goes
against
their
interpretation
of
certain
religious
texts
and
therefore
they
may
oppose
laws
that
would
give
these
groups
equal
rights
another
reason
may
be
due
to
a
belief
in
traditional
gender
roles
and
sexual
orientations
some
conservatives
may
believe
that
there
are
only
two
genders
male
and
female
and
that
people
should
only
be
attracted
to
members
of
the
opposite
sex
they
may
therefore
oppose
laws
that
would
give
equal
rights
to
those
who
do
not
fit
into
these
traditional
gender
roles
or
sexual
orientations
it
s
also
possible
that
some
conservatives
may
simply
not
understand
or
agree
with
the
experiences
and
perspectives
of
the
community
and
therefore
may
not
support
equal
rights
for
them
overall
it
s
important
to
remember
that
there
are
many
different
viewpoints
on
this
issue
and
that
not
everyone
may
agree
on
the
best
way
to
ensure
equal
rights
for
all
people
including
those
in
the
community
the
sensation
of
falling
in
dreams
is
actually
a
very
common
experience
and
can
be
caused
by
a
variety
of
factors
one
reason
people
may
experience
this
sensation
is
due
to
changes
in
their
body
position
while
they
are
sleeping
when
you
are
lying
down
your
body
is
in
a
state
of
relative
stillness
however
if
you
move
or
shift
positions
while
you
are
sleeping
your
body
may
perceive
this
movement
as
falling
this
can
trigger
a
reflex
that
causes
you
to
feel
like
you
are
falling
or
to
experience
a
sensation
of
vertigo
another
reason
people
may
experience
the
sensation
of
falling
in
their
dreams
is
due
to
changes
in
their
brain
activity
while
they
are
sleeping
during
the
dreaming
stage
of
sleep
known
as
rapid
eye
movement
sleep
the
brain
is
more
active
and
may
produce
vivid
and
sometimes
strange
or
surreal
dreams
in
some
cases
the
sensation
of
falling
may
be
part
of
the
dream
content
and
may
be
related
to
the
dreamer
s
feelings
or
emotions
finally
the
sensation
of
falling
in
dreams
may
be
related
to
the
way
our
brains
process
and
interpret
sensory
information
while
we
are
asleep
during
sleep
our
brains
are
still
receiving
and
processing
sensory
information
from
our
surroundings
even
though
we
are
not
consciously
aware
of
it
this
sensory
information
may
be
incorporated
into
our
dreams
and
may
contribute
to
the
vividness
and
realism
of
the
dream
experience
overall
the
sensation
of
falling
in
dreams
is
a
normal
and
common
experience
that
is
caused
by
a
combination
of
factors
related
to
body
position
brain
activity
and
sensory
processing
during
sleep
holding
a
knife
with
the
blade
facing
down
is
generally
a
more
stable
and
secure
grip
especially
when
the
knife
is
being
used
for
thrusting
or
stabbing
motions
when
the
blade
is
facing
up
it
is
more
likely
to
slip
out
of
the
hand
or
be
deflected
by
an
opponent
in
addition
holding
a
knife
with
the
blade
facing
down
allows
the
user
to
have
better
control
over
the
blade
and
to
apply
more
force
when
making
a
strike
imagine
that
you
are
holding
an
apple
in
your
hand
and
you
want
to
cut
it
in
half
with
a
knife
if
you
hold
the
knife
with
the
blade
facing
up
it
might
be
more
difficult
to
control
the
blade
and
keep
it
from
slipping
as
you
make
the
cut
on
the
other
hand
if
you
hold
the
knife
with
the
blade
facing
down
it
will
be
easier
to
keep
the
blade
steady
and
apply
more
force
as
you
cut
through
the
apple
in
movies
and
games
assassins
and
other
characters
who
use
knives
may
hold
them
with
the
blade
facing
down
for
these
same
reasons
it
allows
them
to
have
better
control
over
the
weapon
and
to
make
more
precise
and
powerful
strikes
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
a
carton
of
beer
might
cost
less
than
four
wine
glasses
quantity
a
carton
of
beer
contains
bottles
while
you
are
only
buying
four
wine
glasses
when
you
buy
in
larger
quantities
the
cost
per
unit
in
this
case
per
bottle
or
per
glass
is
often
lower
materials
wine
glasses
are
typically
made
from
materials
like
glass
or
crystal
which
can
be
more
expensive
to
produce
than
the
materials
used
to
make
beer
bottles
such
as
glass
or
aluminum
brand
the
specific
brand
of
wine
glasses
and
beer
that
you
are
comparing
might
also
have
an
impact
on
the
price
some
brands
are
known
for
using
higher quality
materials
or
have
a
more
premium
image
which
can
result
in
higher
prices
production
and
distribution
costs
the
process
of
producing
and
distributing
wine
and
beer
also
involves
different
costs
for
example
the
process
of
making
wine
involves
fermenting
grapes
and
aging
the
finished
product
which
can
be
more
time consuming
and
costly
than
the
process
of
brewing
beer
additionally
wine
is
often
shipped
and
stored
at
specific
temperatures
to
preserve
quality
which
can
also
add
to
the
overall
cost
overall
the
price
of
a
product
is
determined
by
a
combination
of
factors
including
the
materials
used
the
brand
the
quantity
and
the
costs
involved
in
production
and
distribution
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
the
same
products
or
brands
might
have
different
names
in
different
countries
one
reason
is
that
different
countries
often
have
different
languages
and
it
can
be
easier
for
people
to
recognize
and
remember
a
brand
name
if
it
is
written
in
their
own
language
for
example
is
a
brand
of
toothpaste
that
is
popular
in
the
states
and
is
a
brand
of
toothpaste
that
is
popular
in
brands
make
toothpaste
but
they
have
different
names
because
they
are
marketed
to
people
who
speak
different
languages
another
reason
why
products
might
have
different
names
in
different
countries
is
because
different
countries
have
different
regulations
about
what
can
be
sold
and
how
it
can
be
marketed
for
example
some
countries
have
laws
that
require
products
to
have
certain
types
of
labels
or
warning
messages
or
that
prohibit
certain
types
of
advertising
in
order
to
comply
with
these
laws
companies
might
need
to
use
different
names
for
their
products
in
different
countries
some
companies
simply
choose
to
use
different
names
for
their
products
in
different
countries
in
order
to
appeal
to
different
markets
for
example
a
company
might
use
a
more
traditional
or
classic
name
for
its
products
in
one
country
and
a
more
modern
or
trendy
name
in
another
country
in
order
to
better
match
the
preferences
of
consumers
in
those
markets
forensic
psychologists
use
a
variety
of
techniques
to
create
criminal
profiles
but
they
do
not
typically
include
very
specific
details
like
the
make
model
and
color
of
a
suspect
s
car
or
their
hobbies
instead
they
focus
on
analyzing
the
characteristics
of
the
crime
and
the
behavior
of
the
perpetrator
to
create
a
profile
of
the
person
who
is
most
likely
to
have
committed
the
crime
to
create
a
criminal
profile
forensic
psychologists
may
consider
factors
such
as
the
type
of
crime
that
was
committed
the
age
and
gender
of
the
victim
and
any
other
details
about
the
crime
scene
that
may
be
relevant
they
may
also
review
police
reports
and
interviews
with
witnesses
to
gather
additional
information
about
the
crime
once
they
have
gathered
this
information
forensic
psychologists
use
their
training
in
psychology
and
criminal
behavior
to
make
educated
guesses
about
the
characteristics
of
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
for
example
they
may
consider
whether
the
crime
was
committed
in
a
very
organized
or
a
very
disorganized
manner
which
can
provide
clues
about
the
personality
and
level
of
intelligence
of
the
perpetrator
overall
the
goal
of
creating
a
criminal
profile
is
to
help
law
enforcement
narrow
down
their
list
of
suspects
and
ultimately
identify
and
catch
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
it
s
important
to
note
that
a
company
can
still
be
successful
and
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
economy
even
if
it
experiences
losses
in
some
quarters
or
years
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
a
company
like
might
continue
to
operate
despite
reporting
losses
the
company
may
have
a
strong
financial
foundation
amd
may
have
a
large
cash
reserve
or
access
to
credit
that
allows
it
to
continue
operating
despite
experiencing
losses
the
company
may
be
investing
in
growth
sometimes
a
company
will
report
losses
because
it
is
investing
in
new
products
technologies
or
markets
that
it
expects
will
generate
profits
in
the
future
this
can
be
seen
as
a
long term
investment
in
the
company
s
growth
and
success
the
company
may
be
facing
short term
challenges
a
company
might
experience
losses
due
to
temporary
issues
such
as
increased
competition
changes
in
market
conditions
or
supply
chain
disruptions
these
challenges
can
be
addressed
over
time
and
the
company
may
return
to
profitability
once
they
are
resolved
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
not
all
types
of
losses
are
created
equal
for
example
some
losses
may
be
due
to
one time
expenses
such
as
legal
settlements
or
restructuring
costs
while
others
may
be
ongoing
operational
expenses
this
can
affect
how
a
company
s
losses
are
perceived
and
whether
they
are
seen
as
a
long term
concern
or
a
temporary
issue
is
a
series
of
books
and
movies
about
a
young
boy
named
who
discovers
that
he
is
a
wizard
and
goes
to
a
school
for
magic
the
series
became
very
popular
because
it
had
an
exciting
and
engaging
story
with
relatable
characters
and
it
was
able
to
appeal
to
readers
and
viewers
of
all
ages
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
series
success
was
that
it
was
able
to
capture
the
imagination
of
readers
and
keep
them
engaged
with
its
complex
and
well developed
plot
the
books
and
movies
also
featured
memorable
characters
such
as
and
who
readers
could
root
for
and
relate
to
additionally
the
series
was
able
to
build
a
strong
and
dedicated
fan
base
through
its
immersive
and
detailed
world building
the
series
featured
a
rich
and
detailed
magical
universe
with
its
own
rules
customs
and
history
which
made
it
easy
for
readers
to
get
lost
in
the
story
and
become
invested
in
the
characters
and
their
adventures
the
combination
of
an
exciting
and
engaging
story
relatable
characters
and
immersive
world building
helped
make
a
massively
successful
series
that
continues
to
be

by
readers
and

around
the
world
unions
are
organizations
that
workers
can
join
to
advocate
for
better
working
conditions
wages
and
benefits
some
people
believe
that
unions
are
important
because
they
help
workers
have
a
stronger
voice
in
the
workplace
and
can
help
improve
the
lives
of
workers
other
people
believe
that
unions
can
be
harmful
because
they
can
make
it
harder
for
companies
to
do
business
and
can
lead
to
higher
prices
for
goods
and
services
the
controversy
surrounding
unions
in
often
stems
from
differing
beliefs
about
the
role
of
government
and
business
in
society
some
people
believe
that
the
government
should
do
more
to
protect
the
rights
of
workers
and
that
unions
are
an
important
way
to
do
this
others
believe
that
the
government
should
stay
out
of
business
decisions
and
that
unions
can
get
in
the
way
of
a
company
s
ability
to
be
competitive
and
successful
there
are
also
often
differing
beliefs
about
the
role
of
unions
in
the
economy
some
people
believe
that
unions
help
to
create
a
more
balanced
distribution
of
wealth
and
power
while
others
believe
that
unions
can
hurt
the
economy
by
making
it
harder
for
companies
to
operate
and
compete
the
controversy
surrounding
unions
in
is
complex
and
multifaceted
and
there
are
valid
arguments
on
both
sides
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
we
might
not
have
high
resolution
color
cameras
on
some
space
probes
and
satellites
one
reason
is
that
these
devices
often
need
to
be
small
and
lightweight
in
order
to
be
launched
into
space
adding
a
high
resolution
color
camera
would
add
extra
weight
and
complexity
to
the
design
which
could
make
it
more
difficult
and
expensive
to
launch
another
reason
is
that
the
cameras
need
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
harsh
conditions
of
space
including
extreme
temperatures
radiation
and
micrometeoroid
impacts
these
conditions
can
be
tough
on
electronic
devices
so
the
cameras
need
to
be
robust
and
reliable
in
order
to
function
properly
finally
it
can
also
be
expensive
to
design
and
build
high
resolution
color
cameras
that
are
specifically
designed
for
use
in
space
there
are
also
many
other
scientific
instruments
and
sensors
that
are
needed
on
these
probes
and
satellites
so
there
may
not
be
enough
room
or
resources
to
include
a
high
resolution
color
camera
i
hope
this
helps
to
explain
why
we
might
not
have
high
resolution
color
cameras
on
some
space
probes
and
satellites
it
is
not
true
that
glands
in
the
breast
that
have
produced
milk
can
not
get
cancer
any
part
of
the
body
including
the
breasts
can
potentially
develop
cancer
the
breast
is
made
up
of
various
types
of
cells
including
glandular
cells
which
produce
milk
and
connective
tissue
cells
can
develop
in
either
of
these
types
of
cells
as
well
as
in
other
cells
in
the
breast
the
most
common
type
of
breast
cancer
is
ductal
carcinoma
which
starts
in
the
cells
lining
the
milk
ducts
it
is
important
for
all
individuals
to
be
aware
of
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
breast
cancer
and
to
practice
regular
self exams
and
seek
medical
care
if
they
notice
any
changes
in
their
breasts
it
is
also
important
to
get
regular
mammograms
and
other
screenings
as
recommended
by
a
healthcare
provider
in
order
to
detect
breast
cancer
early
and
increase
the
chances
of
successful
treatment
or
the
is
a
network
that
allows
users
to
browse
the
internet
anonymously
by
routing
their
traffic
through
multiple
layers
of
servers
or
nodes
before
it
reaches
its
destination
this
makes
it
difficult
for
anyone
to
trace
the
traffic
back
to
the
original
user
however
is
not
completely
foolproof
and
there
are
ways
that
an
attacker
could
potentially
deanonymize
a
victim
using
the
network
one
way
this
could
happen
is
if
the
attacker
is
able
to
compromise
a
node
in
the
network
and
monitor
the
traffic
passing
through
it
if
the
victim
is
using
a
vulnerable
device
or
operating
system
the
attacker
may
be
able
to
exploit
a
security
flaw
to
reveal
the
victim
s
address
or
other
identifying
information
another
way
an
attacker
could
potentially
deanonymize
a
victim
using
is
by
setting
up
a
fake
node
on
the
network
and
enticing
the
victim
to
connect
to
it
the
attacker
could
then
monitor
the
victim
s
traffic
and
potentially
reveal
their
identity
it
s
important
to
remember
that
while
can
help
protect
your
anonymity
online
it
is
not
a
guarantee
of
complete
anonymity
it
s
always
a
good
idea
to
use
caution
and
take
steps
to
secure
your
device
and
protect
your
personal
information
when
using
the
internet
whether
you

or
not

are
two
different
types
of
services
and
they
operate
in
different
ways
is
a
subscription based
service
which
means
you
pay
a
monthly
fee
to
access
the
content
they
offer
this
content
is
usually
exclusive
and
not
available
for
free
on
other
platforms
in
exchange
for
this
exclusivity
and
the
cost
of
producing
and
acquiring
this
content
charges
a
subscription
fee
on
the
other
hand
is
a
free
platform
that
is
supported
by
advertising
when
you
watch
a
video
you
may
see
ads
before
during
or
after
the
video
these
ads
help
generate
revenue
which
is
used
to
cover
the
costs
of
hosting
and
streaming
the
videos
on
their
platform
in
short
charges
a
fee
for
access
to
exclusive
content
while
is
free
but
displays
ads
to
generate
revenue
both
models
have
their
pros
and
cons
and
it
s
up
to
you
to
decide
which
one
you
prefer
before
radar
and
sonar
were
invented
pirates
and
navies
used
a
variety
of
methods
to
track
down
other
ships
one
common
method
was
to
use
visual
clues
such
as
looking
for
the
sails
or
smoke
from
the
ship
s
chimney
they
might
also
use
telescopes
or
other
instruments
to
help
them
spot
ships
at
a
distance
another
method
was
to
use
the
stars
and
other
celestial
bodies
as
navigation
aids
by
looking
at
the
position
of
the
stars
and
other
celestial
objects
sailors
could
determine
their
own
location
and
the
direction
they
were
heading
they
could
then
use
this
information
to
figure
out
where
other
ships
might
be
located
sailors
also
used
maps
and
charts
to
help
them
navigate
the
oceans
these
could
show
them
the
locations
of
land
masses
reefs
and
other
hazards
as
well
as
the
directions
of
the
currents
and
winds
by
using
these
tools
sailors
could
plan
their
routes
and
figure
out
the
best
way
to
reach
their
destination
finally
sailors
might
use
their
own
senses
such
as
hearing
and
smell
to
help
them
locate
other
ships
for
example
they
might
be
able
to
hear
the
sound
of
another
ship
s
anchor
being
dropped
or
the
smell
of
wood
smoke
from
its
chimney
overall
while
tracking
down
other
ships
was
difficult
before
the
invention
of
modern
technology
sailors
were
still
able
to
use
a
variety
of
tools
and
techniques
to
navigate
the
oceans
and
locate
other
ships
mixing
different
colors
of
light
actually
does
result
in
a
different
color
just
like
mixing
paint
does
the
difference
is
in
how
our
eyes
and
brains
interpret
the
colors
when
you
mix
two
colors
of
paint
together
the
pigments
in
the
paint
absorb
certain
wavelengths
of
light
and
reflect
others
for
example
red
paint
reflects
red
light
and
absorbs
other
colors
when
you
mix
red
and
green
paint
together
the
resulting
color
is
a
brownish
color
because
the
pigments
in
the
paint
are
absorbing
all
of
the
colors
of
light
except
for
brown
on
the
other
hand
when
you
mix
two
colors
of
light
together
like
red
and
green
the
resulting
color
is
a
bright
yellow
because
the
light
is
actually
adding
together
this
is
because
light
is
made
up
of
different
wavelengths
of
energy
and
when
you
mix
two
colors
of
light
together
you
are
adding
the
wavelengths
of
energy
together
so
the
reason
why
mixing
paint
results
in
a
different
color
than
mixing
light
is
because
paint
absorbs
certain
wavelengths
of
light
while
light
adds
different
wavelengths
of
energy
together
is
a
company
that
produces
agricultural
products
including
seeds
and
chemicals
some
people
believe
that
is
an
evil
company
because
they
have
been
involved
in
several
controversial
practices
one
reason
some
people
view
as
evil
is
because
they
have
been
accused
of
producing
genetically
modified
organisms
that
may
have
negative
impacts
on
the
environment
and
human
health
these
are
plants
or
animals
that
have
had
their
dna
altered
in
a
laboratory
in
order
to
give
them
certain
desired
traits
such
as
resistance
to
pests
or
the
ability
to
grow
in
certain
conditions
some
people
are
concerned
that
these
genetically
modified
organisms
could
harm
the
natural
environment
and
have
unintended
consequences
for
human
health
another
reason
some
people
view
as
evil
is
because
the
company
has
been
accused
of
using
questionable
tactics
to
promote
their
products
and
protect
their
patents
for
example
has
been
accused
of
suing
farmers
who
saved
and
replanted
seeds
from
their
crops
even
though
this
is
a
common
practice
among
farmers
the
company
has
also
been
accused
of
attempting
to
influence
the
scientific
research
and
regulatory
processes
related
to
their

storm
clouds
are
gray
because
they
contain
a
lot
of
water
droplets
that
are
very
close
together
when
light
from
the
sun
or
other
sources
passes
through
these
droplets
it
scatters
in
all
directions
this
is
what
makes
the
clouds
appear
white
however
storm
clouds
are
often
much
denser
and
contain
a
lot
more
water
droplets
than
normal
clouds
this
means
that
more
light
is
scattered
in
all
directions
which
can
make
the
clouds
appear
darker
this
is
why
storm
clouds
are
often
gray
normal
clouds
are
white
because
they
also
contain
water
droplets
but
these
droplets
are
farther
apart
from
each
other
this
means
that
less
light
is
scattered
in
all
directions
which
makes
the
clouds
appear
white
overall
the
color
of
clouds
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
water
droplets
they
contain
and
how
these
droplets
scatter
light
clouds
appear
gray
because
they
contain
a
lot
of
water
droplets
that
scatter
a
lot
of
light
in
all
directions
while
normal
clouds
appear
white
because
they
contain
fewer
water
droplets
that
scatter
less
light
it
is
not
clear
from
your
question
where
the
figure
comes
from
or
what
the
context
is
for
this
expenditure
however
it
is
possible
that
someone
could
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
trying
to
develop
a
new
alphabet
letter
or
symbol
to
represent
the
word
the
as
part
of
a
larger
project
to
create
a
new
writing
system
or
modify
an
existing
one
this
could
involve
research
design
work
prototyping
testing
and
marketing
among
other
things
it
could
also
involve
paying
for
the
services
of
experts
or
consultants
in
fields
such
as
linguistics
typography
or
communication
design
however
it
is
important
to
note
that
creating
a
new
alphabet
letter
or
symbol
is
a
complex
and
challenging
task
that
would
likely
require
a
significant
investment
of

and
expertise

as
a
user
it
s
important
to
know
that
and
are
not
directly
competing
technologies
they
are
simply
two
different
ways
of
creating
and
displaying
content
on
the
internet
and
each
has
its
own
strengths
and
weaknesses
here
are
some
key
differences
between

requires
a
separate

to
be
installed
in
your
web
browser
in
order
to
work
while
is
built
into
most
modern
browsers
and
does
not
require
any
additional
software
this
means
that

is
generally
more
widely
compatible
and
can
be
accessed
on
a
wider
range
of
devices
including
smartphones
and
tablets
performance
content
tends
to
perform
better
than
content
especially
on
mobile
devices
this
is
because
content
is
designed
to
be
lightweight
and
efficient
while
content
can
be
more
resource intensive
and
may
not
run
as
smoothly
on
some
devices
security
has
a
reputation
for
being
less
secure
than
as
it
is
more
susceptible
to
malware
and
other
types
of
online
threats
on
the
other
hand
has
built in
security
features
that
help
to
protect
against
these
types
of
threats
ultimately
which
technology
is
better
for
you
as
a
user
will
depend
on
your
specific
needs
and
preferences
if
you
need
to
access
interactive
content
or
games
on
the
internet
then
may
be
a
good
option
for
you
if
you
are
primarily
interested
in
accessing
static
content
such
as
text
and
images
or
using
web based
applications
then
may
be
a
better
choice
preheating
the
oven
is
important
because
it
ensures
that
the
oven
has
reached
the
proper
temperature
before
you
start
cooking
your
pizza
if
you
put
the
pizza
in
an
oven
that
is
not

enough
it
will
take
longer
to
cook
and
the

like
as
for
the
instructions
to
keep
the
pizza
frozen
while
preheating
the
oven
this
is
probably
because
the
pizza
will
cook
more
evenly
if
it
goes
into
the
oven
frozen
when
the
pizza
is
frozen
the
heat
of
the
oven
will
thaw
and
cook
it
gradually
rather
than
going
straight
from
cold
to
hot
and
potentially
cooking
unevenly
overall
following
the
instructions
on
the
pizza
box
such
as
preheating
the
oven
and
keeping
the
pizza
frozen
can
help
you
achieve
the
best
possible
results
when
cooking
your
pizza
has
a
very
efficient
system
for
getting
items
shipped
to
customers
quickly
here
s
how
it
works
when
you
order
something
from
the
company
uses
its
computer
systems
to
find
the
item
you
want
in
one
of
its
many
warehouses
around
the
world
these
warehouses
are
like
giant
stores
where
keeps
all
of
the
items
it
sells
once
the
computer
finds
the
item
it
tells
a
worker
to
pick
it
up
and
put
it
in
a
box
the
box
is
then
sent
to
a
sorting
facility
where
it
is
sorted
and
sent
to
a
package
delivery
company
like
or
the
delivery
company
then
takes
the
box
and
brings
it
to
your
house
so
does
n t
necessarily
have
big
factories
in
every
state
but
it
does
have
a
network
of
warehouses
around
the
world
where
it
keeps
a
wide
variety
of
items
when
you
order
something
from
the
company
is
able
to
quickly
find
the
item
and
get
it
shipped
to
you
through
this
system
is
a
tactic
used
by
politicians
in
some
countries
including
the
states
to
try
to
block
or
delay
a
vote
on
a
bill
or
proposal
it
s
called
filibustering
because
it
can
involve
a
politician
giving
a
very
long
speech
or
talking
for
a
long
time
in
order
to
delay
the
vote
is
considered
a
valid
tactic
in
politics
because
it
allows
politicians
to
have
a
say
in
the
decision making
process
and
to
express
their
views
and
concerns
it
can
also
be
used
as
a
way
to
force
a
compromise
or
a
change
in
the
proposal
being
considered
however
filibuster
can
also
be
used
as
a
way
to
block
or
delay
important
decisions
or
progress
on
important
issues
some
people
argue
that
filibuster
should
be
reformed
or
limited
in
order
to
allow
the
government
to
function
more
efficiently
and
to
make
sure
that
important
issues
are
not
held
up
for
too
long
overall
filibuster
can
be
a
useful
tactic
for
ensuring
that
all
voices
are
heard
and
for
allowing
for
discussion
and
debate
but
it
can
also
be
abused
and
used
to
obstruct
the
work
of
the
government
a
rubber
chicken
is
a
toy
that
is
often
used
for
comedic
purposes
it
is
made
of
rubber
and
is
shaped
like
a
chicken
people
often
use
rubber
chickens
as
props
in
jokes
or
as
part
of
a
comedy
routine
they
might
make
silly
noises
or
gestures
with
the
rubber
chicken
to
make
people
laugh
chickens
are
also
sometimes
used
as
party
decorations
or
given
as
gifts
they
are
meant
to
be
fun
and
silly
and
they
are
not
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
movies
and
tv
shows
often
use
newborn
babies
as
actors
for
scenes
that
require
a
baby
to
be
shown
on
screen
these
babies
are
usually
provided
by
baby
casting
agencies
which
are
companies
that
specialize
in
finding
and
hiring
babies
and
young
children
for
roles
in
the
entertainment
industry
the
babies
used
in
movies
and
tv
shows
are
typically
a
few
weeks
or
months
old
and
they
are
usually
accompanied
by
a
parent
or
guardian
on
set
the
babies
are
carefully
supervised
by
the
production
team
and
are
only
used
for
short
periods
of
time
to
ensure
their
safety
and
well being
in
some
cases
filmmakers
may
use
props
or
special
effects
to
create
the
appearance
of
a
newborn
baby
on
screen
rather
than
using
a
real
baby
this
can
be
done
using
dolls
animatronics
or
computer generated
imagery
however
it
is
often
more
realistic
to
use
real
babies
when
they
are
needed

a
scene
acid
diethylamide
is
a
powerful
hallucinogenic
drug
that
can
cause
changes
in
a
person
s
perception
of
reality
thoughts
and
emotions
it
is
often
taken
in
the
form
of
small
squares
of
paper
that
have
been
soaked
in
the
drug
when
someone
takes
they
may
experience
hallucinations
which
are
vivid
and
distorted
perceptions
of
things
that
are
not
really
there
they
may
see
hear
and
feel
things
that
are
not
real
they
may
also
have
altered
perceptions
of
time
and
space
and
may
feel
disconnected
from
their
own
body
it
is
important
to
note
that
can
be
very
unpredictable
and
the
effects
can
vary
greatly
from
person
to
person
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
is
illegal
in
many
countries
and
it
is
not
safe
to
use
in
the
states
the
phrase
is
commonly
used
to
wish
someone
a
happy
holiday
season
in
other
english speaking
countries
such
as
the
and
the
phrase
happy
is
more
commonly
used
the
origins
of
these
phrases
can
be
traced
back
to
the
early
history
of
the
holiday
is
an
adjective
that
means
joyful
and
light hearted
and
happy
is
an
adjective
that
means
feeling
or
showing
pleasure
both
words
are
used
to
describe
the
feelings
of
joy
and
happiness
that
are
associated
with
the
holiday
the
use
of
these
phrases
varies
from
country
to
country
and
is
influenced
by
a
variety
of
factors
including
cultural
and
regional
traditions
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
both
phrases
are
used
in
different
parts
of
the
world
and
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
wish
someone
a
happy
holiday
season
which
stands
for
the
and
is
based
in
for
a
few
reasons
one
reason
is
because
is
close
to
the
equator
which
makes
it
easier
to
launch
rockets
into
space
this
is
because
the
s
rotation
is
faster
at
the
equator
which
means
that
rockets
can
get
a
little
extra
boost
when
they
launch
another
reason
is
because
has
a
long
history
with
space
travel
the
first
american
astronaut
launched
into
space
from
in
since
then
many
other
important
space
missions
have
launched
from
including
the
missions
to
the
and
the
space
shuttle
program
finally
has
a
lot
of
open
space
and
good
weather
which
makes
it
a
good
place
to
test
and
launch
rockets
the
which
is
located
on
the
east
coast
of
is
the
main
launch
site
for
and
has
been
used
for
many
important
space
missions
so
in
short
is
a
good
place
for
to
launch
rockets
because
it
s
close
to
the
equator
has
a
long
history
with
space
travel
and
has
a
lot
of
open
space
and
good
weather
it
s
important
to
remember
that
is
a
country
with
a
rich
and
diverse
culture
and
like
any
other
country
it
has
a
range
of
cultural
practices
and
expressions
while
it
is
true
that
has
a
reputation
for
being
a
more
traditional
and
conservative
culture
it
is
also
home
to
a
vibrant
and
creative
media
industry
the
japanese
media
industry
is
known
for
producing
a
wide
variety
of
content
including
video
games
tv
shows
and
music
that
often
incorporates
elements
of
japanese
culture
and
history
this
can
include
things
like
traditional
japanese
instruments
and
themes
as
well
as
more
modern
and
unconventional
elements
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
different
parts
of
japanese
culture
can
have
different
levels
of
conservatism
for
example
some
aspects
of
japanese
culture
such
as
traditional
family
structure
or
gender
roles
may
be
more
conservative
while
other
parts
of
japanese
culture
such
as
the
media
industry
may
be
more
open
to
experimentation
and
innovation
overall
it
s
important
to
remember
that
is
a
complex
and
multifaceted
culture
and
it
s
not
fair
to
generalize
or
stereotype
all
aspects
of
japanese
culture
based
on
a
few
specific
examples
it
can
be
difficult
for
people
with
minimum
wage
jobs
to
get
by
in
cities
like
and
where
the
cost
of
living
is
high
these
cities
have
high
costs
for
things
like
housing
food
and
transportation
which
can
make
it
hard
for
people
who
do
n t
have
a
lot
of
money
to
afford
the
things
they
need
one
way
that
people
with
minimum
wage
jobs
can
try
to
make
ends
meet
is
by
finding
ways
to
save
money
for
example
they
might
look
for
cheaper
places
to
live
such
as
shared
apartments
or
homes
or
they
might
try
to
find
ways
to
save
money
on
food
such
as
by
cooking
at
home
instead
of
eating
out
another
way
that
people
with
minimum
wage
jobs
can
try
to
get
by
is
by
finding
ways
to
make
more
money
this
might
involve
getting
a
second
job
finding
ways
to
earn
extra
money
on
the
side
or
even
starting
their
own
business
it
s
also
important
for
people
with
minimum
wage
jobs
to
be
smart
about
their
money
and
to
make
a
budget
to
help
them
stay
on
track
this
might
involve
setting
aside
money
for
important
expenses
like
rent
and
bills
and
cutting
back
on
unnecessary
expenses
like
going
out
to
eat
or
buying
expensive
clothes
overall
it
can
be
challenging
for
people
with
minimum
wage
jobs
to
get
by
in
cities
with
high
costs
of
living
but
with
careful
planning
and
hard
work
it
is
possible
to
make
ends
meet
when
soldiers
are
killed
in
conflict
their
weapons
and
gear
are
often
collected
and
returned
to
their
home
country
or
military
base
the
weapons
are
typically
taken
out
of
service
and
either
destroyed
or
stored
for
later
use
the
gear
such
as
clothing
and
other
equipment
is
also
collected
and
either
cleaned
or
repaired
for
reuse
or
discarded
if
it
is
not
in
good
condition
it
is
important
to
keep
track
of
and
properly
dispose
of
military
equipment
because
it
can
be
dangerous
if
it
falls
into
the
wrong
hands
in
some
cases
the
equipment
may
be
donated
to
other
countries
or
organizations
that
need
it
overall
the
goal
is
to
make
sure
that
the
equipment
is
used
responsibly
and
safely
and
to
ensure
that
it
is
not
used
to
harm
others
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
gas
prices
have
gone
down
in
the
past
few
months
one
reason
is
that
there
is
currently
a
lot
of
oil
being
produced
around
the
world
oil
is
used
to
make
gasoline
so
when
there
is
a
lot
of
oil
available
it
can
help
to
lower
the
price
of
gasoline
another
reason
is
that
people
are
using
less
gasoline
due
to
the
pandemic
many
people
are
staying
at
home
and
not
driving
as
much
which
means
there
is
less
demand
for
gasoline
when
there
is
less
demand
for
a
product
the
price
of
that
product
tends
to
go
down
some
countries
produce
and
export
a
lot
of
oil
and
the
price
of
oil
is
often
influenced
by
the
relationships
between
these
countries
and
how
they
trade
with
each
other
if
there
is
a
lot
of
oil
being
produced
and
exported
by
certain
countries
it
can
help
to
lower
the
price
of
gasoline
so
in
summary
gas
prices
have
gone
down
because
there
is
currently
a
lot
of
oil
being
produced
people
are
using
less
gasoline
due
to
the
pandemic
and
the
relationships
between
oil producing
countries
can
also
affect
the
price
the
is
a
part
of
the
to
the
states
it
states
that
no
person
shall
be
subject
for
the
same
offense
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb
this
means
that
if
someone
is
acquitted
found
not
guilty
of
a
crime
they
can
not
be
tried
again
for
the
same
crime
the
double
is
designed
to
protect
people
from
being
subjected
to
the
stress
and
expense
of
multiple
trials
for
the
same
crime
it
also
helps
to
prevent
the
government
from
using
its
power
to
try
to
punish
someone
over
and
over
again
until
it
gets
the
result
it
wants
however
there
are
some
exceptions
to
the
for
example
if
new
evidence
is
discovered
that
was
not
available
at
the
time
of
the
original
trial
it
may
be
possible
to
bring
someone
to
trial
again
for
the
same
crime
additionally
the
does
not
apply
in
cases
where
the
crime
was
committed
in
different
states
or
in
cases
where
the
person
was
tried
in
both
a
state
court
and
a
federal
court
some
people
argue
that
taxes
are
a
form
of
theft
because
they
feel
that
the
government
is
taking
their
money
without
their
consent
they
may
also
believe
that
the
government
is
not
using
their
tax
money
in
a
way
that
benefits
them
or
that
the
government
is
not
providing
enough
value
in
return
for
the
taxes
they
are
collecting
however
it
is
generally
accepted
that
taxes
are
necessary
for
the
functioning
of
a
government
and
the
provision
of
public
goods
and
services
such
as
roads
schools
and
healthcare
in
most
countries
it
is
also
the
law
to
pay
taxes
and
people
who
do
not
pay
their
taxes
can
face
penalties
or
fines
while
people
may
have
political
beliefs
that
are
opposed
to
paying
taxes
it
is
generally
not
possible
to
refuse
to
pay
taxes
because
of
these
beliefs
in
most
countries
failing
to
pay
taxes
is
against
the
law
and
can
result
in
legal
consequences
there
are
many
different
countries
in
the
world
and
each
one
has
its
own
name
in
its
own
language
sometimes
the
name
of
a
country
in
one
language
is
different
from
the
name
of
the
same
country
in
another
language
for
example
the
country
we
call
in
is
called
in
japanese
the
country
we
call
in
is
called
in
german
this
is
because
different
languages
have
different
words
and
sounds
and
sometimes
the
way
a
word
is
pronounced
or
spelled
in
one
language
is
different
from
the
way
it
is
pronounced
or
spelled
in
another
language
so
people
who
speak
different
languages
might
have
different
names
for
the
same
place
but
no
matter
what
a
country
is
called
in
a
particular
language
it
is
still
the
same
place
and
the
people
who
live
there
are
still
the
same
people
vegetables
get
their
vitamins
and
minerals
from
the
soil
and
the
water
that
they
absorb
through
their
roots
the
soil
contains
a
variety
of
nutrients
that
plants
need
to
grow
and
thrive
including
vitamins
and
minerals
when
a
plant
absorbs
water
from
the
soil
it
also
takes
in
these
nutrients
along
with
it
the
plant
then
uses
these
nutrients
to
produce
energy
through
photosynthesis
which
is
the
process
of
converting
sunlight
into
energy
so
in
a
way
vegetables
eat
the
nutrients
that
are
in
the
soil
and
water
and
use
the
energy
from
sunlight
to
turn
those
nutrients
into
the
vitamins
and
minerals
that
they
need
to
survive
this
is
how
vegetables
are
able
to
provide
us
with
important
nutrients
when
we
eat
them
does
this
help
to
clarify
things
in
the
phonetic
alphabet
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
is
represented
by
a
specific
word
the
word
niner
is
used
to
represent
the
number
because
it
is
easier
to
understand
and
less
prone
to
confusion
than
just
saying
the
word
nine
this
is
especially
important
when
communicating
over
the
radio
or
other
noisy
communications
channels
where
it
is
important
to
be
able
to
clearly
and
accurately
understand
what
is
being
said
using
a
specific
word
for
each
number
helps
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
confusion
about
which
number
is
being
referred
to
it
s
possible
that
people
use
danish
cookie
containers
as
sewing
containers
because
they
are
a
convenient
size
and
shape
for
storing
small
sewing
supplies
such
as
needles
pins
and
buttons
the
containers
may
also
have
a
tight fitting
lid
that
helps
keep
the
contents
secure
and
free
from
dust
and
debris
additionally
the
containers
may
be
made
of
a
sturdy
material
that
can
withstand
the
wear
and
tear
of
everyday
use
some
people
may
also
appreciate
the
aesthetic
of
using
a
cookie
container
as
a
sewing
container
as
it
can
add
a
touch
of
whimsy
to
their
crafting
space
ultimately
the
reason
why
people
use
danish
cookie
containers
as
sewing
containers
may
vary
from
person
to
person
but
it
could
be
for
any
of
the
reasons
mentioned
above
is
a
famous
artist
who
is
known
for
creating
graffiti
art
that
often
has
a
political
or
social
message
some
people
believe
that
is
the
pseudonym
of
a
single
person
while
others
believe
that
it
may
be
a
group
of
artists
who
work
together
there
are
a
few
ways
that
experts
can
tell
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
is
by
or
not
one
way
is
by
looking
at
the
style
of
the
artwork
s
art
has
a
distinctive
style
that
is
instantly
recognizable
to
many
people
and
experts
can
often
tell
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
is
by
just
by
looking
at
it
another
way
to
tell
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
is
by
is
by
looking
at
the
location
where
it
was
created
often
creates
his
graffiti
in
secret
and
in
unexpected
places
so
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
is
found
in
a
place
where
is
known
to
have
worked
it
is
more
likely
to
be
by
him
finally
experts
can
also
use
other
clues
to
determine
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
is
by
such
as
the
materials
and
techniques
that
were
used
to
create
it
for
example
often
uses
stencils
to
create
his
graffiti
so
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
was
made
using
stencils
it
is
more
likely
to
be
by
him
while
it
is
not
always
possible
to
know
for
certain
if
a
piece
of
graffiti
is
by
or
not
experts
can
use
a
combination
of
these
methods
to
make
an
educated
guess
thunder
and
lightning
are
caused
by
the
movement
of
electrical
charges
within
a
cloud
or
between
a
cloud
and
the
ground
is
made
up
of
frozen
water
vapor
while
rain
is
made
up
of
liquid
water
during
a
snowstorm
the
air
is
typically
too
cold
for
the
snow
to
melt
and
become
rain
so
there
is
no
movement
of
electrical
charges
and
therefore
no
thunder
or
lightning
to
understand
this
better
think
about
the
difference
between
ice
and
water
is
a
solid
while
water
is
a
liquid
if
you
put
ice
in
a
warm
room
it
will
eventually
melt
and
become
water
similarly
if
the
air
is
warm
enough
snow
will
melt
and
become
rain
but
if
the
air
is
cold
the
snow
will
stay
frozen
and
there
wo
n t
be
any
thunder
or
lightning
is
a
markup
language
that
is
used
to
structure
and
format
content
on
the
web
while
is
a
file
format
for
image
files
that
supports
short
low resolution
animations
and
serve
different
purposes
and
are
used
for
different
types
of
content
on
the
web
is
more
efficient
than
in
terms
of
data
usage
because
it
allows
you
to
display
images
and
other
types
of
media
directly
in
the
code
without
having
to
use
separate
image
files
this
means
that
you
can
include
images
and
other
media
on
your
web
pages
without
adding
extra
data
to
your
website
in
contrast
are
separate
image
files
that
have
to
be
downloaded
separately
from
the
code
which
can
increase
the
amount
of
data
needed
to
load
a
web
page
is
also
faster
than
because
it
allows
you
to
display
media
directly
in
the
code
rather
than
having
to
load
separate
image
files
this
can
make
your
web
pages
load
faster
especially
on
devices
with
slower
internet
connections
overall
is
a
more
efficient
and
flexible
way
to
display
media
on
the
web
compared
to
which
is
why
it
is
more
widely
used
today
however
are
still
used
for
certain
types
of
content
such
as
short

and
memes
because
they
are
easy
to
create
and

companies
make
money
by
selling
electricity
to
customers
the
amount
of
electricity
that
a
customer
uses
is
measured
in
kilowatt hours
kwh
the
electric
company
charges
a
certain
amount
of
money
for
each
kwh
of
electricity
that
a
customer
uses
using
energy efficient
light
bulbs
such
as
compact
fluorescent
lamps
can
help
a
customer
use
less
electricity
because
these
bulbs
use
less
energy
than
traditional
incandescent
bulbs
if
a
customer
uses
less
electricity
then
they
will
pay
less
money
to
the
electric
company
however
the
electric
company
still
wants
customers
to
use
electricity
because
it
is
a
source
of
revenue
for
them
so
the
electric
company
may
provide
incentives
such
as
discounts
or
rebates
to
encourage
customers
to
switch
to
energy efficient
bulbs
this
can
help
the
electric
company
save
money
on
their
own
energy
costs
as
well
as
help
the
environment
by
reducing
energy
consumption
in
the
end
both
the
electric
company
and
the
customer
can
benefit
from
using
energy efficient
bulbs
because
it
can
lead
to
lower
electricity
bills
and
a
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
it
s
important
to
understand
that
the
situation
in
is
complex
and
there
are
many
different
factors
at
play
has
a
long
history
with
and
the
two
countries
have
close
cultural
economic
and
political
ties
one
factor
that
has
contributed
to
the
current
crisis
is
s
concern
about
the
influence
of
western
countries
particularly
the
states
in
has
historically
seen
as
being
within
its
sphere
of
influence
and
has
been
wary
of
any
efforts
by
western
countries
to
gain
influence
there
another
factor
is
the
issue
of
which
is
a
peninsula
in
the
that
was
part
of
but
was
annexed
by
in
this
annexation
was
not
recognized
by
most
of
the
international
community
and
was
met
with
condemnation
and
economic
sanctions
overall
it
s
difficult
to
say
exactly
what
s
motivations
are
in
the
crisis
as
there
are
many
different
factors
at
play
and
it
s
a
complex
situation
it
s
important
to
try
to
understand
the
perspectives
of
all
parties
involved
and
to
approach
the
situation
with
an
open
mind
the
cost
of
sending
scores
and
transcripts
may
vary
for
a
number
of
reasons
one
reason
is
that
the
organizations
that
handle
these
services
have
different
operating
costs
such
as
employee
salaries
technology
expenses
and
overhead
costs
like
rent
and
utilities
additionally
the
demand
for
these
services
may
also
be
different
which
can
impact
the
price
for
example
more
students
may
need
to
send
transcripts
to
colleges
and
universities
than
scores
so
the
cost
of
sending
transcripts
may
be
lower
in
order
to
make
it
more
accessible
for
students
finally
the
cost
of
sending
transcripts
may
also
be
lower
because
transcripts
typically
contain
more
information
than
a
single
score
and
it
may
be
more
expensive
for
the
organization
to
process
and
transmit
this
additional
information
in
we
often
use
gender specific
pronouns
to
refer
to
inanimate
objects
this
means
that
we
might
use
she
or
her
to
refer
to
a
ship
or
a
car
even
though
these
things
are
not
alive
and
do
not
have
a
gender
this
is
a
way
of
speaking
that
we
have
inherited
from
the
way
that
has
evolved
over
time
and
it
is
not
based
on
any
inherent
qualities
of
the
objects
themselves
one
reason
why
we
might
use
she
to
refer
to
a
ship
is
because
ships
have
traditionally
been
given
feminine
names
especially
in
naval
contexts
for
example
a
ship
might
be
named
after
a
woman
or
a
mythological
figure
such
as
the
also
known
as
which
was
named
after
the
states
because
ships
are
often
given
feminine
names
it
has
become
common
to
refer
to
them
using
feminine
pronouns
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
different
languages
have
different
ways
of
referring
to
inanimate
objects
in
some
languages
all
nouns
are
either
masculine
or
feminine
and
the
gender
of
the
noun
determines
the
gender
of
the
pronoun
used
to
refer
to
it
in
this
is
not
the
case
and
we
can
use
any
pronoun
to
refer
to
an
inanimate
object
if
the
stopped
spinning
it
would
be
a
very
big
problem
here
s
why
the
earth
spins
on
its
axis
which
is
an
imaginary
line
that
goes
through
the
and
this
is
what
makes
it
feel
like
the
sun
is
rising
and
setting
every
day
if
the
stopped
spinning
the
sun
would
just
stay
in
one
place
in
the
sky
and
it
would
be
very
hot
on
one
side
of
the
and
very
cold
on
the
other
side
the
s
spin
also
helps
to
keep
the
oceans
moving
if
the
stopped
spinning
the
oceans
would
all
pile
up
on
one
side
of
the
and
there
would
be
a
huge
wave
on
the
other
side
the
s
spin
also
helps
to
keep
the
atmosphere
moving
if
the
stopped
spinning
the
air
would
all
pile
up
on
one
side
of
the
and
there
would
be
very
strong
winds
on
the
other
side
finally
if
the
stopped
spinning
everything
on
the
would
be
thrown
off
into
space
this
includes
all
the
people
animals
and
buildings
on
the
it
would
be
a
very
big
mess
so
in
short
if
the
stopped
spinning
it
would
be
a
very
big
problem
and
cause
a
lot
of
problems
for
everyone
and
everything
on
the
is
a
fictitious
game
that
was
created
for
a
comedy
sketch
show
called
that
and
the
game
is
played
by
two
contestants
and
the
rules
are
completely
made
up
and
absurd
for
example
the
host
might
say
that
the
winner
is
the
person
who
can
multiply
the
numbers
on
their
calculator
the
fastest
or
the
person
who
can
come
up
with
the
most
creative
way
to
clap
their
hands
there
is
no
actual
strategy
or
skill
involved
in
playing
it
s
just
a
silly
and
humorous
way
to
make
fun
of
game
shows
people
who
are
born
blind
do
dream
just
like
people
who
can
see
however
their
dreams
may
be
different
from
the
dreams
of
people
who
can
see
because
people
who
are
born
blind
have
never
experienced
visual
stimuli
their
dreams
may
not
include
visual
elements
like
seeing
colors
or
images
instead
their
dreams
may
be
made
up
of
other
sensory
experiences
such
as
sounds
feelings
textures
or
the
shapes
of
things
they
have
experienced
through
touch
for
example
a
person
who
is
blind
might
dream
about
the
feeling
of
the
wind
on
their
face
or
the
sound
of
a
bird
singing
they
might
also
dream
about
the
texture
of
a
favorite
blanket
or
the
shape
of
a
toy
they
like
to
play
with
overall
the
dreams
of
people
who
are
born
blind
may
be
unique
and
different
from
the
dreams
of
people
who
can
see
but
they
can
still
be
just
as
rich
and
vivid
in
football
the
team
with
possession
of
the
ball
called
the
offense
has
four
chances
or
downs
to
move
the
ball
yards
down
the
field
if
they
are
successful
in
moving
the
ball
yards
they
earn
another
set
of
downs
if
the
offense
fails
to
move
the
ball
yards
possession
of
the
ball
is
turned
over
to
the
other
team
called
the
defense
one
way
for
the
offense
to
move
the
ball
is
by
throwing
it
through
the
air
called
a
pass
the
offense
can
also
try
to
move
the
ball
by
running
with
it
called
a
rush
in
the
situation
you
are
describing
it
was
probably
considered
bad
for
the
to
pass
the
ball
because
it
may
not
have
been
the
most
effective
way
for
them
to
move
the
ball
and
get
closer
to
scoring
there
could
be
a
number
of
reasons
why
passing
the
ball
may
not
have
been
the
best
choice
such
as
the
defense
anticipating
the
pass
and
intercepting
the
ball
or
the
quarterback
the
player
who
throws
the
ball
not
having
enough
time
to
throw
the
ball
due
to
pressure
from
the
defense
it
s
also
possible
that
the
team
had
been
trying
to
pass
the
ball
and
were
not
having
success
and
so
it
may
have
been
more
effective
for
them
to
try
to
run
the
ball
or
use
a
different
strategy
to
try
to
move
the
ball
down
the
field
ultimately
the
team
s
decision
on
whether
to
pass
or
run
the
ball
will
depend
on
a
variety
of
factors
including
the
specific
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
offense
and
defense
the
situation
on
the
field
and
the
overall
game
plan
doctors
can
use
several
different
methods
to
find
out
if
a
person
has
allergies
one
common
method
is
to
do
a
skin
prick
test
during
this
test
a
small
amount
of
an
allergen
such
as
a
substance
that
a
person
might
be
allergic
to
is
placed
on
the
skin
and
then
a
needle
is
used
to
prick
the
skin
through
the
allergen
if
the
person
is
allergic
to
the
allergen
they
will
develop
a
raised
bump
or
rash
on
their
skin
another
way
to
test
for
allergies
is
to
do
a
blood
test
during
this
test
a
blood
sample
is
taken
from
the
person
and
sent
to
a
laboratory
where
it
is
tested
for
the
presence
of
antibodies
to
specific
allergens
antibodies
are
proteins
produced
by
the
body
s
immune
system
in
response
to
an
allergen
if
the
person
has
allergies
their
blood
will
contain
high
levels
of
these
antibodies
it
s
important
to
note
that
doctors
do
not
usually
test
for
allergies
by
exposing
a
person
to
the
allergen
directly
this
is
because
allergies
can
cause
serious
reactions
such
as
difficulty
breathing
or
a
drop
in
blood
pressure
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
intentionally
trigger
these
reactions
instead
doctors
use
safer
methods
such
as
skin
prick
tests
and
blood
tests
to
test
for
allergies
is
not
the
most
common
disease
associated
with
mutations
in
fact
most
dna
mutations
do
not
cause
any
significant
problems
or
diseases
however
some
dna
mutations
can
cause
problems
with
the
way
cells
function
and
can
lead
to
the
development
of
cancer
is
a
disease
in
which
cells
in
the
body
grow
and
divide
in
an
uncontrolled
way
cells
in
the
body
follow
a
specific
pattern
of
growth
and
division
but
cancer
cells
do
not
they
continue
to
grow
and
divide
even
when
the
body
does
not
need
them
and
they
do
not
die
when
they
should
this
can
lead
to
the
formation
of
tumors
which
can
be
harmful
if
they
grow
in
certain
parts
of
the
body
or
if
they
spread
to
other
parts
of
the
body
there
are
many
different
factors
that
can
increase
the
risk
of
developing
cancer
including
genetics
environmental
factors
and
lifestyle
factors
dna
mutations
can
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
cancer
but
they
are
not
the
only
cause
so
to
answer
your
question
dna
mutations
can
sometimes
lead
to
cancer
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
there
are
many
other
factors
that
can
also
contribute
to
the
development
of
cancer
planes
with
multiple
wings
like
the
one
in
the
image
you
provided
are
called
multiplane
or
sesquiplane
designs
these
designs
were
experimented
with
in
the
early
days
of
aviation
but
they
were
not
widely
used
because
they
did
not
perform
as
well
as
planes
with
fewer
wings
there
are
several
reasons
why
planes
with
multiple
wings
are
not
typically
used
one
reason
is
that
they
are
more
complex
and
expensive
to
build
than
planes
with
fewer
wings
they
also
tend
to
be
heavier
and
less
efficient
which
means
that
they
require
more
power
to
fly
and
use
more
fuel
planes
with
two
wings
or
biplanes
were
the
most
common
design
in
the
early
days
of
aviation
they
are
still
used
today
in
some
specialty
applications
such
as
crop
dusting
or
airshows
most
modern
planes
however
have
a
single
long
wing
called
a
monoplane
this
design
is
more
aerodynamic
and
efficient
and
it
allows
the
plane
to
fly
faster
and
further
than
a
biplane
four winged
planes
or
quadruplanes
have
also
been
experimented
with
but
they
have
not
been
widely
used
because
they
do
not
offer
significant
advantages
over
other
designs
the
number
of
wings
on
an
airplane
is
determined
by
a
combination
of
factors
including
the
size
and
weight
of
the
plane
the
type
of
mission
it
will
be
used
for
and
the
desired
performance
characteristics
engineers
and
designers
carefully
consider
these
factors
when
designing
a
new
plane
to
ensure
that
it
is
safe
efficient
and
capable
of
meeting
the
needs
of
its
intended
use
teeth
also
known
as
third
molars
are
the
last
teeth
to
emerge
in
the
mouth
usually
appearing
in
the
late
teenage
years
or
early
twenties
these
teeth
were
once
an
important
part
of
the
human
diet
because
they
helped
people
chew
tough
and
fibrous
foods
that
were
common
in
our
ancestors
diets
however
as
our
diets
have
changed
and
become
softer
over
time
wisdom
teeth
have
become
less
necessary
in
many
people
there
is
not
enough
room
in
the
mouth
for
the
wisdom
teeth
to
emerge
properly
which
can
cause
problems
such
as
pain
infection
and
crowding
of
the
other
teeth
it
s
not
entirely
clear
why
wisdom
teeth
still
exist
if
they
can
cause
so
many
problems
some
scientists
believe
that
wisdom
teeth
may
have
once
served
a
useful
purpose
but
are
now
vestigial
meaning
that
they
have
lost
their
original
function
due
to
evolution
others
think
that
wisdom
teeth
may
still
have
some
use
but
more
research
is
needed
to
understand
this
overall
wisdom
teeth
are
a
leftover
from
our
ancestors
times
and
are
not
as
important
as
they
once
were
however
they
can
still
cause
problems
if
they
do
n t
have
enough
room
to
emerge
properly
so
it
s
important
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
and
visit
a
dentist
if
you
experience
any
pain
or
other
issues
it
s
important
to
remember
that
the
people
you
see
in
the
emergency
room
come
from
all
walks
of
life
and
can
come
from
any
social
or
economic
background
it
s
also
important
to
understand
that
the
people
you
see
in
the
emergency
room
are
there
because
they
are
experiencing
a
medical
emergency
and
need
immediate
care
this
means
that
they
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
their
regular
doctor
or
may
not
have
access
to
regular
medical
care
it
s
also
possible
that
the
people
you
see
in
the
emergency
room
may
not
have
the
financial
resources
to
pay
for
regular
medical
care
and
may
rely
on
the
emergency
room
as
a
source
of
medical
care
it
s
important
to
be
understanding
and
compassionate
towards
others
regardless
of
their
background
or
circumstances
and
to
remember
that
everyone
deserves
access
to
quality
medical
care
it
s
important
to
note
that
the
claim
that
was
selling
oil
for
per
barrel
is
not
accurate
also
known
as
the
of
and
is
a
militant
group
that
has
been
designated
as
a
terrorist
organization
by
many
governments
around
the
world
the
group
has
been
known
to
engage
in
various
illegal
activities
including
the
sale
of
smuggled
oil
and
other
illicit
goods
as
a
way
to
fund
its
operations
however
it
is
not
a
legitimate
source
of
oil
and
it
is
not
possible
to
buy
oil
from
through
legal
channels
it
is
illegal
to
provide
material
support
to
terrorist
organizations
including
buying
goods
from
them
and
doing
so
can
result
in
serious
consequences
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
the
global
price
of
oil
is
determined
by
a
variety
of
factors
including
supply
and
demand
geopolitical
considerations
and
economic
conditions
and
is
not
directly
related
to
the
activities
of
taking
a
photo
of
the
requires
a
few
things
a
camera
you
ll
need
a
camera
that
can
take
long
exposures
which
means
it
can
keep
the
shutter
open
for
a
longer
time
to
let
in
more
light
this
is
important
because
the
is
usually
too
dim
to
see
with
the
naked
eye
so
you
need
to
take
a
long
exposure
to
capture
it
a
tripod
you
ll
need
a
tripod
to
hold
your
camera
steady
while
you
take
the
photo
this
is
important
because
if
your
camera
moves
even
a
little
bit
while
the
shutter
is
open
the
photo
will
come
out
blurry
a
dark
sky
to
see
the
you
need
to
be
somewhere
with
very
little
light
pollution
this
means
you
need
to
be
far
away
from
cities
which
have
lots
of
lights
that
can
wash
out
the
stars
the
right
time
of
year
the
is
only
visible
in
the
night
sky
at
certain
times
of
the
year
it
s
best
to
see
it
in
the
summer
months
when
it
s
high
in
the
sky
once
you
have
all
of
these
things
you
can
set
up
your
camera
on
the
tripod
and
take
a
long
exposure
photo
of
the
the
photo
will
come
out
looking
like
a
bright
band
of
light

the

with

around
it
a
grand
jury
is
a
group
of
people
who
are
chosen
to
decide
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
to
charge
someone
with
a
crime
if
the
grand
jury
decides
that
there
is
enough
evidence
they
will
issue
a
true
bill
of
indictment
which
means
that
the
person
will
be
charged
with
a
crime
and
will
have
to
go
to
trial
juries
are
different
from
normal
juries
in
a
few
ways
one
difference
is
that
grand
juries
do
n t
decide
whether
someone
is
guilty
or
not
guilty
their
job
is
only
to
decide
if
there
is
enough
evidence
to
charge
someone
with
a
crime
juries
also
do
n t
have
to
follow
the
same
rules
as
a
normal
trial
for
example
the
person
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury
does
n t
have
the
right
to
be
present
or
to
have
a
lawyer
present
during
the
grand
jury
proceedings
it
s
not
uncommon
for
police
officers
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
when
they
are
being
investigated
for
a
crime
this
might
happen
if
someone
has
accused
the
police
officer
of
wrongdoing
or
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
officer
broke
the
law
if
the
grand
jury
decides
that
there
is
enough
evidence
to
charge
the
police
officer
with
a
crime
then
the
officer
will
have
to
go
to
trial
to
face
those
charges
there
are
a
few
factors
that
can
make
one
tire
better
than
another
and
these
factors
can
also
contribute
to
differences
in
price
let
s
start
with
the
basics
tires
are
made
of
rubber
and
they
have
tread
on
the
bottom
that
helps
them
grip
the
road
tires
also
have
a
sidewall
which
is
the
part
of
the
tire
that
you
can
see
between
the
tread
and
the
wheel
the
sidewall
has
important
information
printed
on
it
like
the
size
of
the
tire
and
the
maximum
load
and
speed
it
can
handle
now
let
s
talk
about
some
of
the
factors
that
can
make
one
tire
better
than
another
performance
some
tires
are
designed
for
specific
types
of
driving
or
weather
conditions
for
example
you
might
want
a
tire
with
a
softer
compound
for
better
grip
on
a
race
track
or
a
tire
with
a
lot
of
tread
for
better
traction
in
the
rain
tires
that
are
designed
for
high
performance
or
specific
driving
conditions
tend
to
cost
more
because
they
require
more
advanced
materials
and
engineering
quality
tires
can
also
vary
in
terms
of
quality
which
can
affect
their
performance
and
lifespan
higher quality
tires
are
typically
made
with
better
materials
and
more
advanced
manufacturing
processes
which
can
make
them
last
longer
and
perform
better
these
tires
tend
to
cost
more
but
they
can
save
you
money
in
the
long
run
because
you
wo
n t
have
to
replace
them
as
often
brand
the
brand
of
the
tire
can
also
affect
the
price
some
tire
brands
are
known
for
making
high quality
high performance
tires
that
come
with
a
higher
price
tag
other
brands
might
offer
more
budget friendly
options
that
may
not
have
the
same
level
of
performance
or
quality
so
to
sum
it
up
tires
can
vary
in
price
based
on
their
performance
quality
and
brand
tires
that
are
designed
for
high
performance
or
specific
driving
conditions
made
with
high quality
materials
and
advanced
manufacturing
processes
or
made
by
a
well known
brand
tend
to
cost
more
movies
that
are
not
originally
filmed
in
can
be
converted
into
in
post production
which
means
after
the
movie
has
already
been
filmed
and
is
being
prepared
for
release
to
do
this
the
movie
is
first
divided
into
two
separate
images
one
for
the
left
eye
and
one
for
the
right
eye
these
images
are
then
slightly
offset
from
each
other
to
create
the
illusion
of
depth
when
viewed
through
special
glasses
that
have
one
red
lens
and
one
blue
lens
or
one
green
and
one
magenta
the
process
of
converting
a
movie
into
is
complex
and
time consuming
and
it
involves
using
computer
software
to
analyze
the
images
and
assign
different
levels
of
depth
to
different
objects
in
the
frame
this
allows
the
version
of
the
movie
to
have
a
sense
of
depth
and
perspective
that
makes
it
feel
more
immersive
and
realistic
so
to
sum
it
up
movies
that
are
not
originally
filmed
in
can
be
made
to
look
like
they
were
filmed
in
by
using
special
computer
software
to
create
two
slightly
offset
images
and
adding
depth
to
different
objects
in
the
frame
when
these
images
are
viewed
through
special
glasses
they
create
the
illusion
of
there
are
several
differences
between
the
facial
features
of
men
and
women
that
can
help
to
determine
their
gender
here
are
a
few
examples
men
tend
to
have
stronger
and
more
defined
jawlines
while
women
tend
to
have
softer
and
rounder
jawlines
men
tend
to
have
thicker
eyebrows
while
women
tend
to
have
thinner
eyebrows
men
tend
to
have
larger
noses
while
women
tend
to
have
smaller
noses
men
tend
to
have
a
larger
distance
between
their
eyes
while
women
tend
to
have
a
smaller
distance
between
their
eyes
if
you
were
trying
to
determine
the
gender
of
a
person
whose
head
was
found
with
no
hair
eyebrows
or
eye
lashes
you
could
look
at
these
facial
features
to
help
you
make
a
guess
it
s
important
to
note
however
that
these
are
generalizations
and
there
can
be
overlap
between
the
facial
features
of
men
and
women
it
s
also
possible
for
someone
to
have
facial
features
that
do
n t
match
the
typical
expectations
for
their
gender
so
it
s
important
to
be
mindful
of
this
when
trying
to
determine
someone
s
gender
it
is
generally
not
legal
for
gas
stations
to
sell
drug
paraphernalia
which
includes
items
like
pipes
bongs
and
grinders
that
are
primarily
used
for
consuming
illegal
drugs
however
some
gas
stations
may
still
sell
these
items
because
they
can
be
used
for
other
purposes
as
well
such
as
grinding
herbs
for
cooking
or
tobacco
for
smoking
in
these
cases
the
gas
station
may
argue
that
they
are
not
intending
for
the
items
to
be
used
for
illegal
purposes
and
they
are
simply
selling
them
as
everyday
products
it
s
worth
noting
that
the
laws
regarding
the
sale
of
drug
paraphernalia
vary
by
state
and
country
and
it
s
possible
that
some
gas
stations
may
be
breaking
the
law
by
selling
these
items
if
you
have
concerns
about
a
gas
station
selling
drug
paraphernalia
you
can
contact
your
local
authorities
or
speak
to
the
management
of
the
gas
station
traditionally
new
seasons
of
tv
shows
have
premiered
in
the
fall
because
that
is
when
the
major
networks
like
and
have
their
upfronts
which
are
presentations
to
advertisers
about
the
new
shows
that
they
will
be
airing
in
the
upcoming
television
season
the
upfronts
usually
take
place
in
and
the
new
tv
seasons
begin
in
this
allows
the
networks
to
promote
their
new
shows
to
a
large
audience
over
the
summer
so
that
people
will
be
more
likely
to
watch
when
the
new
seasons
begin
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
it
might
make
sense
for
some
shows
to
come
out
in
the
spring
or
summer
instead
for
one
thing
there
is
typically
less
competition
for
viewership
during
these
times
of
year
since
there
are
fewer
new
shows
premiering
this
can
be
especially
helpful
for
shows
that
are
trying
to
establish
a
strong
following
and
might
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
during
the
crowded
fall
season
additionally
the
weather
is
generally
nicer
in
the
spring
and
summer
which
can
make
it
a
more
appealing
time
for
people
to
sit
down
and
watch
tv
overall
it
really
depends
on
the
show
and
what
the
creators
and
networks
think
will
be
the
best
time
for
it
to
be
released
some
shows
might
be
more
successful
in
the
fall
while
others
might
do
better
in
the
spring
or
summer
when
you
exercise
your
body
uses
up
energy
and
can
become
tired
when
you
push
yourself
to
do
a
very
intense
workout
your
body
can
become
overwhelmed
and
not
be
able
to
keep
up
with
the
physical
demands
you
are
putting
on
it
this
can
cause
a
number
of
physical
symptoms
including
feeling
sick
to
your
stomach
and
throwing
up
throwing
up
after
a
workout
can
also
be
a
sign
of
overexertion
which
means
that
you
have
pushed
yourself
too
hard
and
your
body
is
not
able
to
handle
the
stress
overexertion
can
cause
your
body
to
release
certain
hormones
and
chemicals
that
can
make
you
feel
sick
and
cause
you
to
throw
up
it
s
important
to
listen
to
your
body
and
not
push
yourself
too
hard
when
you
are
exercising
it
s
okay
to
challenge
yourself
and
work
hard
but
it
s
also
important
to
take
breaks
and
rest
when
you
need
to
and
to
hydrate
and
fuel
your
body
properly
before
and
after
your
workouts
firefighters
use
a
variety
of
methods
to
determine
the
cause
of
a
fire
one
of
the
most
common
methods
is
to
look
for
patterns
in
the
way
the
fire
burned
for
example
if
a
fire
starts
in
one
specific
area
and
spreads
outward
it
may
be
an
indication
that
the
fire
was
caused
by
something
in
that
area
such
as
an
electrical
problem
or
a
candle
another
way
that
firefighters
can
determine
the
cause
of
a
fire
is
by
looking
for
clues
at
the
scene
of
the
fire
this
might
include
things
like
a
burned
cigarette
butt
melted
electrical
wiring
or
other
materials
that
may
have
been
involved
in
starting
the
fire
it
s
important
to
note
that
sometimes
it
can
be
difficult
to
determine
the
exact
cause
of
a
fire
especially
if
the
fire
was
very
large
or
if
it
destroyed
a
lot
of
evidence
in
these
cases
firefighters
may
have
to
use
a
combination
of
different
methods
to
figure
out
what
happened
christians
and
all
believe
in
the
existence
of
one
however
they
have
different
beliefs
about
the
nature
and
characteristics
of
in
is
believed
to
be
a
trinity
with
three
persons
in
one
divine
being
the
the
and
the
christians
believe
that
is
the
of
and
that
he
came
to
earth
as
a
human
to
save
people
from
their
sins
in
is
believed
to
be
a
single
indivisible

with
no
partners
or
equals
believe
that
revealed
his
will
and
guidance
for
humanity
through
the
prophet
and
the
holy
book
of
the
also
believes
in
one
who
is
the
creator
and
ruler
of
the
universe
believe
that
revealed
himself
and
his
laws
to
the
prophet
and
that
the
the
jewish
holy
book
contains
s
laws
and
teachings
while
christians
and
all
believe
in
the
existence
of
one
they
have
different
beliefs
about
the
nature
and
characteristics
of
and
how
has
revealed
himself
to
humanity
as
a
result
they
may
have
different
practices
and
rituals
related
to
their
faith
countries
that
operate
a
no
tax
policy
like
still
need
to
find
ways
to
fund
their
governments
and
pay
for
the
services
they
provide
to
their
citizens
one
way
they
can
do
this
is
by
relying
on
other
sources
of
income
such
as
tourism
or
the
sale
of
goods
and
services
for
example
is
a
small
country
located
on
the
coast
in
it
is
known
for
its
luxury
casinos
hotels
and
high end
real
estate
these
industries
bring
in
a
lot
of
money
for
the
government
and
help
fund
the
services
it
provides
to
its
citizens
such
as
education
and
healthcare
another
way
that
countries
with
no
tax
policy
can
fund
their
governments
is
by
charging
fees
for
certain
services
such
as
the
use
of
roads
or
the
sale
of
licenses
these
fees
can
provide
the
government
with
a
source
of
income
that
can
be
used
to
pay
for
the
services
it
provides
to
its
citizens
it
s
important
to
note
that
while
does
not
have
a
traditional
tax
system
it
still
has
certain
requirements
for
businesses
and
individuals
living
and
working
in
the
country
for
example
businesses
must
pay
fees
for
the
right
to
operate
in
and
individuals
must
pay
fees
to
live
or
work
in
the
country
these
fees
help
to
fund
the
services
provided
by
the
government
rice
is
often
cheaper
than
brown
rice
because
it
is
more
processed
and
has
had
the
bran
and
germ
removed
which
are
the
outer
layers
of
the
rice
grain
these
outer
layers
contain
most
of
the
nutrients
fiber
and
flavor
of
the
rice
so
brown
rice
is
generally
considered
to
be
more
nutritious
than
white
rice
however
the
processing
of
white
rice
is
simpler
and
requires
fewer
steps
which
makes
it
cheaper
to
produce
the
demand
for
white
rice
is
also
generally
higher
than
that
for
brown
rice
particularly
in
many
developing
countries
where
it
is
a
staple
food
this
higher
demand
can
also
contribute
to
the
lower
price
of
white
rice
a
strawman
argument
is
a
type
of
argument
where
someone
misrepresents
or
misunderstands
someone
else
s
position
and
then
attacks
this
misrepresented
position
instead
of
the
real
position
it
s
like
building
a
straw
man
a
dummy
made
of
straw
to
knock
down
instead
of
fighting
the
real
person
here
s
an
example
person
a
i
think
we
should
recycle
more
because
it
helps
the
environment
but
you
just
want
to
force
everyone
to
do
things
your
way
and
take
away
our
freedom
s
argument
is
a
strawman
because
they
misunderstood
or
misrepresented
s
position
never
said
anything
about
taking
away
freedom
they
just
said
they
think
recycling
is
good
for
the
environment
s
argument
attacks
this
misrepresented
position
instead
of
the
real
position
in
other
words
a
strawman
argument
is
when
someone
sets
up
a
dummy
version
of
someone
else
s
argument
and
then
attacks
that
instead
of
the
real
argument
it
s
a
way
of
avoiding
a
real
discussion
or
debate
by
attacking
a
position
that
the
other
person
does
n t
actually
hold
to
liftoff
is
a
sequence
of
events
that
occurs
before
a
rocket
is
launched
it
helps
to
ensure
that
everything
is
ready
for
the
launch
and
that
all
the
necessary
checks
have
been
completed
there
are
many
different
steps
that
need
to
be
done
before
a
rocket
can
be
launched
and
the
countdown
helps
to
ensure
that
everything
is
done
in
the
right
order
for
example
the
countdown
may
include
checks
of
the
rocket
s
systems
fueling
the
rocket
and
making
sure
that
all
the
people
and
equipment
are
in
the
right
place
the
countdown
also
helps
to
build
excitement
and
anticipation
for
the
launch
it
s
like
a
countdown
before
a
big
event
like
a
sports
game
or
a
fireworks
show
it
helps
to
build
suspense
and
excitement
for
the
main
event
so
in
short
the
countdown
to
liftoff
serves
both
practical
and
emotional
purposes
it
helps
to
ensure
that
everything
is
ready
for
the
launch
and
also
helps
to
build
excitement
and
anticipation
for
the
event
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
office
buildings
and
skyscrapers
might
keep
their
lights
on
at
night
safety
one
reason
is
for
safety
purposes
keeping
the
lights
on
can
help
people
navigate
the
building
and
find
their
way
around
especially
in
case
of
an
emergency
security
another
reason
is
for
security
having
the
lights
on
can
deter
burglars
and
vandals
and
also
help
security
personnel
keep
an
eye
on
the
building
convenience
some
people
might
be
working
late
or
overnight
in
the
building
and
they
might
need
the
lights
on
to
do
their
work
efficiency
in
some
cases
the
lights
in
office
buildings
and
skyscrapers
might
be
designed
to
be
energy
efficient
so
they
do
n t
use
as
much
energy
as
you
might
think
additionally
turning
the
lights
off
and
on
frequently
can
actually
use
more
energy
than
leaving
them
on
because
it
takes
energy
to
start
up
the
lighting
system
each
time
it
is
turned
on
cost
finally
it
might
be
more
expensive
to
turn
the
lights
off
and
on
all
the
time
than
to
just
leave
them
on
this
is
because
each
time
the
lights
are
turned
on
and
off
it
causes
wear
and
tear
on
the
lighting
system
which
can
shorten
its
lifespan
and
increase
maintenance
costs
overall
there
are
a
number
of
factors
to
consider
when
deciding
whether
to
keep
the
lights
on
in
an
office
building
or
skyscraper
and
it
s
not
always
as
simple
as
just
turning
them
off
to
save
money
it
is
possible
that
the
execution
of
a
death
row
inmate
who
committed
a
crime
such
as
killing
a
guard
on
the
day
of
their
execution
could
be
delayed
so
that
they
can
stand
trial
for
the
additional
crime
this
is
because
everyone
including
death
row
inmates
has
the
right
to
a
fair
and
legal
process
if
the
inmate
is
accused
of
committing
a
crime
they
have
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
where
they
can
present
their
defense
and
have
their
case
heard
by
a
judge
or
jury
this
means
that
they
would
need
to
have
the
opportunity
to
have
an
attorney
represent
them
to
present
evidence
and
witness
testimony
and
to
have
their
case
decided
upon
by
a
fair
and
impartial
decision maker
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
legal
process
can
take
time
and
it
may
be
necessary
to
delay
the
execution
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
inmate
has
the
opportunity
to
have
their
case
heard
and
decided
upon
fairly
progressive
taxation
is
a
system
in
which
people
who
earn
more
money
pay
a
higher
percentage
of
their
income
in
taxes
than
people
who
earn
less
money
in
the
states
the
progressive
tax
system
is
designed
to
reduce
income
inequality
by
taking
a
larger
percentage
of
income
from
people
who
are
more
able
to
pay
and
using
that
money
to
fund
programs
and
services
that
benefit
the
entire
population
such
as
education
healthcare
and
social
security
however
there
are
still
many
factors
that
can
contribute
to
inequality
in
the
states
even
with
a
progressive
tax
system
in
place
for
example
some
people
may
have
access
to
better
education
and
job
opportunities
which
can
lead
to
higher
incomes
additionally
there
may
be
systemic
biases
and
discrimination
that
make
it
more
difficult
for
certain
groups
of
people
to
advance
in
their
careers
or
earn
as
much
as
others
finally
the
overall
distribution
of
wealth
in
a
society
rather
than
just
income
also
plays
a
role
in
inequality
or
the
total
value
of
a
person
s
assets
such
as
their
savings
investments
and
property
can
be
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation
which
can
create
a
more
unequal
distribution
of
resources
over
time
overall
while
a
progressive
tax
system
can
help
to
reduce
inequality
it
is
just
one
factor
among
many
that
contribute
to
the
overall
level
of
inequality
in
a
society
stars
like
our
own
are
made
up
of
very
hot
gases
mostly
hydrogen
and
helium
they
give
off
energy
in
the
form
of
light
and
heat
which
is
what
we
feel
here
on
as
sunlight
stars
are
able
to
stay
in
balance
and
not
explode
or
collapse
because
of
something
called
nuclear
fusion
this
is
a
process
that
happens
in
the
center
of
the
star
where
the
temperature
and
pressure
are
extremely
high
in
nuclear
fusion
the
hydrogen
atoms
combine
to
form
helium
atoms
and
this
releases
a
huge
amount
of
energy
in
the
form
of
light
and
heat
this
energy
helps
to
hold
the
star
up
and
keep
it
from
collapsing
in
on
itself
the
energy
from
nuclear
fusion
also
helps
to
push
outwards
against
the
weight
of
the
outer
layers
of
the
star
which
would
otherwise
cause
the
star
to
collapse
in
short
the
energy
produced
by
nuclear
fusion
helps
to
balance
the
forces
acting
on
a
star
and
keeps
it
from
collapsing
or
exploding
when
you
scratch
your
own
back
you
are
applying
pressure
to
the
skin
and
nerves
in
that
area
which
can
help
to
relieve
the
sensation
of
an
itch
when
someone
else
scratches
your
back
the
sensation
may
be
even
more
pleasurable
because
it
combines
the
physical
sensation
of
the
scratching
with
the
emotional
pleasure
of
being
touched
by
someone
else
it
s
also
possible
that
having
someone
else
scratch
your
back
may
allow
you
to
scratch
in
areas
that
are
difficult
to
reach
on
your
own
which
could
further
increase
the
pleasure
of
the
experience
ultimately
the
pleasure
of
having
someone
else
scratch
your
back
is
likely
due
to
a
combination
of
physical
and
emotional
factors
landing
a
spacecraft
in
a
lake
would
not
be
a
safe
or
practical
way
to
return
to
here
are
a
few
reasons
why
density
is
much
denser
than
air
so
when
a
spacecraft
falls
into
it
from
a
high
altitude
it
will
experience
much
more
resistance
and
deceleration
this
could
cause
the
spacecraft
to
break
apart
or
sustain
serious
damage
upon
impact
depth
lakes
are
typically
not
very
deep
so
if
a
spacecraft
were
to
land
in
one
it
would
have
to
do
so
at
a
very
low
altitude
this
would
not
give
the
spacecraft
enough
time
to
slow
down
and
make
a
safe
landing
control
when
a
spacecraft
returns
to
it
needs
to
be
able
to
control
its
descent
and
land
in
a
specific
location
this
is
not
possible
when
landing
in
a
lake
as
the
spacecraft
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
currents
recovery
finally
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
recover
a
spacecraft
that
has
landed
in
a
lake
specialized
equipment
would
be
needed
to
lift
it
out
of
the
water
which
could
be
time consuming
and
costly
in
summary
landing
a
spacecraft
in
a
lake
is
not
a
safe
or
practical
option
instead
spacecraft
are
designed
to
land
on
solid
ground
where
they
can
touch
down
at
a
controlled
speed
and
be
easily
recovered
a
person
s
net
worth
is
a
measure
of
how
much
wealth
they
have
it
s
the
total
value
of
all
the
things
they
own
minus
any
debts
or
liabilities
they
have
to
calculate
a
person
s
net
worth
you
would
add
up
the
value
of
all
their
assets
such
as
their
house
car
savings
accounts
stocks
and
other
investments
then
you
would
subtract
any
debts
or
liabilities
they
have
such
as
credit
card
balances
student
loans
or
mortgages
the
result
is
their
net
worth
for
example
if
a
person
has
in
savings
a
house
worth
and
no
debts
their
net
worth
would
be
on
the
other
hand
if
that
same
person
had
in
savings
a
house
worth
and
a
mortgage
of
their
net
worth
would
be
since
they
would
be
subtracting
the
mortgage
from
their
total
assets
of
net
worth
is
usually
calculated
by
a
person
themselves
or
by
a
financial
advisor
or
accountant
it
can
be
a
useful
way
to
track
a
person
s
financial
progress
over
time
and
see
how
much
wealth
they
have
built
up
it
s
important
to
note
that
net
worth
is
different
from
income
which
is
the
money
a
person
earns
from
working
or
investing
a
person
s
net
worth
reflects
their
overall
financial
situation
while
their
income
is
just
one
part
of
it
the
states
national
debt
is
the
total
amount
of
money
that
the
federal
government
owes
to
its
creditors
the
debt
is
currently
about
trillion
and
it
is
possible
for
it
to
be
repaid
but
it
would
require
the
government
to
make
regular
payments
to
its
creditors
to
reduce
the
balance
there
are
a
few
ways
that
the
government
could
make
these
payments
by
running
budget
surpluses
this
means
that
the
government
would
bring
in
more
money
through
taxes
and
other
revenues
than
it
spends
on
things
like
defense
education
and
healthcare
the
extra
money
could
be
used
to
pay
down
the
debt
by
selling
assets
the
government
could
sell
things
like
land
buildings
or
other
assets
to
raise
money
to
pay
off
the
debt
by
growing
the
economy
if
the
economy
grows
the
government
will
bring
in
more
money
through
taxes
which
could
be
used
to
pay
down
the
debt
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
national
debt
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
in
fact
it
can
be
a
useful
tool
for
the
government
to
fund
important
projects
and
stimulate
the
economy
however
if
the
debt
gets
too
large
it
can
become
difficult
for
the
government
to
make
the
necessary
payments
which
could
lead
to
financial
problems
the
screen
resolution
became
common
on
laptops
because
it
is
a
good
balance
between
image
quality
and
the
amount
of
processing
power
that
is
needed
to
display
an
image
at
that
resolution
it
is
a
common
resolution
for
laptops
because
it
provides
enough
detail
for
most
tasks
such
as
web
browsing
and
document
editing
without
requiring
a
lot
of
processing
power
this
means
that
laptops
with
screens
can
be
more
energy
efficient
which
is
important
for
devices
that
are
often
used
on
the
go
additionally
is
a
common
resolution
for
panels
which
are
used
in
many
laptop
displays
so
it
is
often
easier
and
more
cost effective
for
manufacturers
to
use

the
of
the
states
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
states
it
was
created
in
and
has
been
amended
a
few
times
since
then
even
though
it
was
created
a
long
time
ago
it
is
still
relevant
today
because
it
sets
out
the
basic
principles
and
structure
of
the
government
and
protects
certain
fundamental
rights
of
the
people
these
principles
and
rights
are
still
important
today
even
though
technology
and
society
have
changed
a
lot
since
the
was
written
for
example
the
guarantees
freedom
of
speech
religion
and
the
press
these
rights
are
important
no
matter
what
technology
is
being
used
because
they
protect
the
ability
of
people
to
express
their
ideas
and
beliefs
without
fear
of
punishment
the
also
sets
out
the
powers
of
the
different
branches
of
government
such
as
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
branches
these
powers
are
still
important
today
because
they
help
to
ensure
that
the
government
is
accountable
to
the
people
and
that
no
one
branch
of
government
becomes
too
powerful
so
even
though
the
was

it

the
company
that
developed
the

created
a
system
called
as
a
way
for
developers
to
get
their

on
which
is
a
digital
distribution
platform
for

games
was
a
way
for
the
community
to
vote
on
which
games
they
wanted
to
see
on
in
order
for
a
game
to
be
released
on
it
had
to
go
through
the
process
would
submit
their

to
and
the

could
then
vote
on
whether

not
they
wanted
to
see
the

on
if
a
game
received
enough
votes
it
would
be

created
as
a
way
to
get
more
games
on
steam
and
to
involve
the
community
in
the
process
of
deciding
which
games
should
be
released
it
also
gave
smaller
developers
a
chance
to
get
their
games
on
even
if
they
did
n t
have
a
publisher
or
a
big
marketing
budget
overall
the
goal
of
was
to
help
make
more
money
by
getting
more
games
on
steam
and
increasing
the
number
of
people
using
the
platform
people
might
use
the
term
so
instead
of
boyfriend
or
girlfriend
because
it
can
be
a
more
casual
and
informal
way
of
referring
to
their
romantic
partner
it
can
also
be
a
way
of
not
disclosing
too
much
personal
information
about
their
relationship
to
others
for
example
if
someone
is
talking
to
a
friend
and
they
do
n t
want
to
share
the
details
of
their
relationship
with
that
person
they
might
use
the
term
so
to
refer
to
their
partner
this
allows
them
to
talk
about
their
partner
without
using
specific
terms
that
might
reveal
more
about
the
nature
of
their
relationship
in
general
people
use
different
terms
to
refer
to
their
romantic
partners
depending
on
their
personal
preferences
and
the
context
in
which
they
are
speaking
some
people
might
prefer
more
formal
terms
while
others
might
prefer
more
casual
or
informal
terms
when
a
company
or
individual
owes
money
to
another
company
or
individual
that
debt
is
known
as
a
credit
obligation
sometimes
the
company
or
individual
who
is
owed
money
may
not
have
the
resources
or
the
desire
to
try
to
collect
the
debt
themselves
in
these
cases
they
may
decide
to
sell
the
debt
to
another
company
the
company
that
buys
the
debt
is
usually
hoping
to
make
a
profit
by
collecting
the
debt
from
the
person
or
company
who
owes
it
they
do
this
by
contacting
the
debtor
and
trying
to
get
them
to
pay
the
debt
if
they
are
successful
in
getting
the
debtor
to
pay
then
the
company
that
bought
the
debt
makes
a
profit
here
s
an
example
company
sells
a
product
to
for
company
does
n t
pay
company
for
the
product
company
a
decides
it
does
n t
want
to
try
to
collect
the
debt
so
it
sells
the
debt
to
for
contacts
and
tries
to
get
them
to
pay
the
debt
if
agrees
to
pay
the
debt
then
will
have
made
a
profit
of
so
in
short
companies
that
buy
and
re sell
debt
make
money
by
collecting
the
debts
that
they
have
purchased
and
keeping
the
difference
between
the
amount
they
paid
for
the
debt
and
the
amount
they
were
able
to
collect
s
uncertainty
principle
is
a
fundamental
idea
in
quantum
mechanics
which
is
a
theory
that
describes
how
very
small
things
like
atoms
and
subatomic
particles
behave
according
to
the
uncertainty
principle
it
is
impossible
to
know
both
the
exact
position
and
the
exact
momentum
speed
and
direction
of
a
particle
at
the
same
time
this
might
seem
strange
but
imagine
trying
to
measure
the
position
of
a
small
insect
flying
around
a
room
if
you
want
to
know
exactly
where
the
insect
is
you
might
try
to
shine
a
flashlight
on
it
but
as
soon
as
you
shine
the
light
on
the
insect
you
change
its
momentum
because
the
light
has
energy
and
when
it
hits
the
insect
it
gives
some
of
that
energy
to
the
insect
so
now
you
know
where
the
insect
is
but
you
do
n t
know
its
momentum
as
well
as
you
did
before
on
the
other
hand
if
you
do
n t
shine
any
light
on
the
insect
you
might
be
able
to
figure
out
its
momentum
for
example
by
clapping
your
hands
and
trying
to
chase
it
but
now
you
do
n t
know
its
position
as
well
as
you
did
before
the
uncertainty
principle
tells
us
that
there
is
always
a
trade off
between
knowing
the
position
and
knowing
the
momentum
of
a
particle
the
more
precisely
we
know
one
of
these
things
the
less
precisely
we
can
know
the
other
this
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
nature
of
the
universe
at
very
small
scales
and
it
has
important
implications
for
how
we
understand
the
world
around
us
when
considering
the
pros
and
cons
of
attending
classes
from
home
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
a
variety
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
one
hand
it
eliminates
the
need
for
physical
attendance
to
classrooms
reduces
the
psychology
of
peer
pressure
and
eliminates
potential
health
risks
resulting
from
attending
crowded
places
in
addition
students
have
the
opportunity
to
arrange
their
learning
environment
according
to
their
preferences
and
better
manage
their
own
time
on
the
other
hand
there
could
be
a
lack
of
social
interaction
with
classmates
a
lack
of
guidance
from
instructors
and
potential
technical
issues
as
well
however
in
the
end
the
effect
that
home based
classes
will
have
on
learning
is
largely
dependent
on
the
situation
of
the
student
for
example
those
who
are
already
motivated
to
learn
and
are
self disciplined
may
reap
the
full
benefits
of
studying
in
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
conversely
for
those
who
require
more
interaction
and
guidance
that
comes
with
physical
classrooms
a
home based
learning
style
may
not
be
as
effective
therefore
when
it
comes
to
allowing
students
the
option
to
attend
classes
from
home
there
are
intricacies
that
need
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
best
decision
is
made
ultimately
this
decision
will
depend
on
the
individual
student
and
their
ability
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
available
to
them
one
of
the
primary
arguments
for
implementing
a
four day
school
week
is
the
potential
cost
savings
many
schools
are
currently
operating
at
a
budget
deficit
and
a
four day
week
could
help
those
districts
by
reducing
the
amount
of
money
spent
on
utilities
staff
and
transportation
additionally
students
would
also
be
provided
with
an
extended
weekend
reducing
the
amount
of
stress
they
experience
during
the
week
however
there
are
several
potential
drawbacks
as
well
for
instance
students
may
struggle
to
stay
motivated
and
focused
with
the
extra
day
off
a
four day
school
week
may
also
increase
the
likelihood
of
teachers
needing
to
miss
class
and
disrupt
lesson
plans
additionally
it
may
be
difficult
to
plan
certain
events
such
as
field
trips
sports
games
and
ultimately
while
a
four day
school
week
may
have
some
benefits
a
thorough
assessment
of
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
must
be
taken
into
consideration
before
implementing
it
at
a
school
it
is
important
to
weigh
both
the
potential
cost
savings
and
the
potential
negative
effects
of
such
a
schedule
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
before
making
any
decisions
about
getting
involved
in
school
activities
it
is
important
to
consult
with
your
parents
and
have
a
clear
understanding
of
how
much
time
you
can
realistically
dedicate
to
them
participating
in
too
many
activities
can
impact
your
ability
to
focus
on
school
work
which
could
result
in
poor
grades
to
ensure
that
parents
are
comfortable
with
the
amount
of
activities
that
you
are
considering
have
a
meeting
with
the
school
to
discuss
the
extracurricular
activities
and
get
parental
feedback
once
everyone
is
on
board
you
can
decide
what
activities
are
right
for
you
while
keeping
in
mind
your
current
workload
once
said
go
confidently
in
the
direction
of
your
dreams
live
the
life
you
ve
imagined
these
inspiring
words
provide
a
valuable
insight
into
the
importance
of
pushing
ourselves
to
strive
for
more
in
life
by
pushing
ourselves
to
push
beyond
our
current
level
of
mastery
there
is
more
potential
to
grow
and
achieve
our
wildest
dreams
i
have
had
many
experiences
in
my
life
affirming
this
notion
particularly
with
regards
to
educational
achievements
during
my
university
years
i
was
often
in
situations
where
i
had
to
push
myself
beyond
what
i
knew
i
could
do
in
order
to
get
a
desired
result
for
example
i
recall
a
time
when
i
had
to
work
extra
hard
to
manage
a
difficult
assignment
in
a
short
time frame
with
a
focused
mindset
and
a
strong
work
ethic
i
surpassed
my
own
expectations
in
the
end
i
achieved
a
grade
that
i
was
proud
of
and
as
a
result
i
felt
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment
and
growth
overall
pushing
ourselves
beyond
what
we
have
already
mastered
provides
an
invaluable
opportunity
to
learn
experience
and
create
something
that
we
may
have
thought
was
an
impossibility
as
said
by
going
confidently
in
the
direction
of
our
dreams
we
are
giving
ourselves
a
chance
to
realize
our
full
potential
and
to
achieve
amazing
feats
character
traits
are
shaped
by
a
wide
range
of
influences
most
notably
the
early
influences
of
parents
siblings
friends
and
school
can
greatly
impact
the
development
of
a
person
s
character
traits
parents
for
example
can
have
a
major
influence
on
a
child
s
moral
compass
by
providing
consistent
guidance
and
setting
a
positive
example
of
how
to
act
and
treat
others
siblings
can
also
be
powerful
models
of
behavior
that
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
development
of
character
traits
particularly
in
the
areas
of
cooperation
communication
and
leadership
friends
can
offer
insights
to
beliefs
values
and
lifestyles
that
can
influence
a
person
s
character
traits
and
of
course
schools
can
provide
opportunities
for
academic
growth
as
well
as
the
potential
for
exploring
different
intellectual
pursuits
developing
social
skills
understanding
cultural
norms
and
engaging
in
activities
that
can
shape
a
person
s
character
traits
all
of
these
influences
serve
to
form
and
inform
a
person
s
character
traits
and
so
a
better
understanding
of
them
can
be
advantageous
online
classes
have
been
increasingly
popular
as
technology
advances
and
the
need
for
social
distancing
increases
there
are
several
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
taking
courses
online
one
pro
is
that
online
classes
can
be
taken
at
any
time
and
from
any
location
making
them
more
accessible
to
people
who
have
difficulty
attending
a
standard
class
there
is
also
evidence
that
online
classes
can
foster
student
engagement
as
students
are
in
control
of
when
and
how
they
access
their
education
additionally
online
classes
make
it
easier
for
students
to
collaborate
and
communicate
with
one
another
in
discussion
forums
or
chat
rooms
on
the
other
hand
there
are
several
drawbacks
to
taking
online
classes
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
motivate
themselves
when
there
is
no
professor
present
and
no
regular
deadlines
and
expectations
online
classes
also
often
lack
the
personal
connections
and
relationships
that
come
from
face to face
instruction
furthermore
several
studies
have
shown
that
students
tend
to
be
less
successful
in
passing
online
classes
than
in
traditional
classroom
courses
in
conclusion
while
there
are
some
advantages
to
taking
online
classes
there
are
also
disadvantages
to
consider
ultimately
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
take
online
classes
should
be
made
on
an
individual
basis
taking
into
account
student
engagement
difficulty
of
passing
and
student teacher
relationships
no
matter
how
hard
we
work
or
how
much
ambition
and
motivation
we
have
failure
is
as
much
a
part
of
success
as
accomplishments
this
is
evidenced
by
the
countless
prominent
successful
individuals
who
have
experienced
numerous
struggles
on
their
path
to
success
for
example
was
famously
fired
from
the
company
he
helped
build
only
to
return
and
lead
it
to
even
greater
success
his
famous
quote
sometimes
life
hits
you
in
the
head
with
a
brick
serves
as
a
reminder
that
failure
is
a
necessary
challenge
to
encounter
when
striving
for
greater
success
this
essay
aims
to
address
how
failure
can
ultimately
be
a
key
element
to
achieving
success
by
exploring
specific
real world
examples
of
prominent
successful
individuals
exploring
the
relationship
between
failure
and
success
and
looking
at
my
own
life
experiences
i
will
demonstrate
that
experiencing
failure
can
be
an
essential
step
towards
success
by
looking
at
the
lives
of
prominent
successful
individuals
we
can
see
the
role
of
failure
in
their
success
from
to
there
are
countless
stories
of
individuals
who
have
failed
on
their
paths
to
becoming
global
success
stories
and
not
just
small
setbacks
individuals
like
for
example
demonstrated
the
huge
leaps
of
progress
that
can
made
from
grappling
with
mistakes
which
ultimately
became
the
foundation
for
some
of
his
most
impressive
accomplishments
we
can
also
look
at
the
relationship
between
failure
and
success
in
our
own
lives
i
for
one
have
experienced
numerous
failures
while
working
towards
a
goal
in
particular
while
preparing
for
my
college
entrance
exams
i
was
faced
with
many
challenges
and
failed
the
first
few
tests
it
was
not
until
i
looked
at
the
mistakes
i
made
that
i
could
understand
what
i
was
doing
wrong
and
make
necessary
changes
in
my
studying
approach
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
failure
can
be
a
powerful
stepping
stone
to
success
prominent
successful
individuals
serve
as
examples
of
how
mistakes
can
lead
to
great
accomplishments
furthermore
by
reflecting
on
our
own
life
experiences
we
can
understand
the
significance
of
failure
in
helping
us
grow
and
reach
our
goals
as
such
it
is
crucial
to
embrace
failure
in
any
endeavor
in
order
to
reach
true
success
famously
wrote
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
the
main
point
of
this
quotation
is
that
when
we
stay
active
and
keep
doing
something
we
can
get
things
done
staying
active
means
staying
focused
on
the
goals
we
want
to
achieve
making
a
plan
to
accomplish
our
goals
and
having
the
dedication
to
complete
it
can
bring
amazing
results
on
the
other
hand
when
we
are
inactive
and
not
accomplishing
tasks
it
can
be
detrimental
to
progress
if
we
are
idle
for
too
long
and
do
not
put
effort
into
our
goals
they
may
remain
stagnant
and
we
might
miss
out
on
opportunities
in
addition
too
much
inactivity
can
lead
to
laziness
apathy
and
depression
therefore
it
s
important
to
evaluate
both
the
pros
and
cons
of
always
doing
something
and
not
doing
something
to
accomplish
goals
doing
something
shows
dedication
and
passion
for
our
goals
while
doing
nothing
might
make
us
miss
out
on
important
progress
when
considering
this
quote
it
s
important
to
strike
a
balance
when
pursuing
our
goals
by
doing
too
much
we
can
exhaust
ourselves
and
affect
our
mental
and
physical
health
but
when
doing
too
little
it
could
affect
our
progress
just
the
same
overall
the
quote
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
by
is
an
inspiring
reminder
to
stay
active
and
move
forward
with
our
goals
it
s
essential
to
be
both
active
and
restful
in
order
to
have
balance
and
obtain
our
goals
in
life
my
grandfather
was
a
huge
influence
on
my
love
for
soccer
growing
up
i
spent
every
after
church
with
him
watching
soccer
games
on
tv
the
energy
and
passion
of
the
crowds
in
the
stadiums
seemed
to
come
alive
through
the
television
and
it
was
contagious
taught
me
about
teamwork
sportsmanship
and
the
rewards
of
hard
work
and
self discipline
and
these
things
have
stayed
with
me
to
this
day
i
have
always
wanted
to
visit
to
get
a
full
feel
of
its
soccer
culture
from
the
to
the
i
would
love
to
wander
through
the
streets
checking
out
the
soccer
shops
and
meeting
other
soccer
fans
is
also
home
to
many
of
the
s
best
professional
and
college
teams
and
it
would
be
a
great
opportunity
to
see
the
game
at
its
highest
level
my
visits
to
would
be
a
great
way
to
honor
my
grandfather
s
memory
and
to
celebrate
the
bond
he
and
i
shared
over
our
shared
love
of
soccer
no
matter
what
i
know
i
will
always
fondly
remember

can
lead
to
disastrous
results
in
people
s
personal
lives
in
the
lives
of
their

and
even
in

for

a
person

reputation
might
be
damaged
relationships
might
suffer
and
future
opportunities
may
be
lost
as
a
result
of
poor
judgement
conversely
making
good
decisions
brings
a
variety
of
positive
outcomes
good
choices
often
lead
to
sound
financial
decisions
strong
personal
relationships
and
increased

is
a
key
part
of
having
a
successful
life
as
i
dug
into
the
personal
stories
of
successful
people
one
common
theme
stood
out
their
resilience
in
the
face
of
failure
whether
it
was
learning
to
code
after
multiple
failed
attempts
to
launch
a
software
company
or
persisting
despite
rejection
of
her
manuscripts
there
s
something
to
be
learned
from
their
perseverance
i
was
reminded
of
my
own
experiences
of
coming
up
short
and
using
those
moments
as
a
springboard
for
growth
as
i
processed
these
feelings
i
was
able
to
reflect
on
how
failure
has
shaped
me
as
a
person
and
pushed
me
farther
down
the
path
that
led
me
to
success
i
identified
the
ways
that
failure
had
contributed
to
my
own
growth
and
the
impact
it
had
on
helping
me
reach
my
goals
i
realized
that
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
it
was
important
to
create
an
environment
that
nurtured
learning
and
positive
self belief
i
was
grateful
for
the
support
of
my
family
and
friends
who
provided
me
with
the
encouragement
and
emotional
support
to
stay
the
course
through
the
combination
of
stumbling
finding
solutions
and
never
giving
up
i
was
able
to
take
failure
in
stride
to
ride
the
wave
of
success

his
essay

is
he
who
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
keeps
with
perfect
sweetness
the
independence
of
solitude
this
statement
captures
the
essence
of
the
idea
of
being
alone
in
the
world
that
is
one
can
be
surrounded
by
people
yet
remain
independent
and
content
despite
the
lack
of
connection
with
them
nevertheless
while
s
words
might
suggest
that
it
is
possible
to
do
something
meaningful
without
the
help
and
support
of
others
this
idea
is
unrealistic
in
practice
human
beings
rely
on
each
other
for
countless
things
whether
it
is
emotional
support
advice
or
practical
assistance
in
achieving
something
in
this
sense
going
it
alone
is
rarely
a
viable
option
and
as
such
it
is
difficult
to
do
something
meaningful
without
the
help
and
support
of
others
at
the
same
time
this
does
not
mean
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
something
meaningful
alone
in
fact
there
are
many
examples
of
individuals
who
have
made
significant
contributions
without
any
sort
of
supportive
network
one
could
argue
that
learning
to
rely
on
oneself
could
be
a
meaningful
achievement
in
its
own
right
therefore
while
it
is
true
that
living
a
life
without
the
help
and
support
of
others
is
more
difficult
it
is
not
impossible
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
individual
to
determine
whether
it
is
possible
to
do
something
meaningful
without
the
help
and
support
of
others
after
much
research
and
analysis
it
is
clear
that
adding
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
implications
for
students
teachers
and
their
families
on
one
side
students
would
be
able
to
gain
more
opportunities
to
have
more
class
time
to
complete
their
coursework
have
additional
tutoring
and
benefit
from
other
extended
educational
experiences
on
the
other
hand
studies
suggest
that
increasing
the
school
day
could
also
lead
to
higher
levels
of
stress
for
both
students
and
teachers
increased
behavioral
issues
in
the
classrooms
and
less
family
time
furthermore
if
parents
are
not
able
to
adjust
their
work
hours
to
accommodate
the
extended
school
days
this
could
lead
to
further
challenges
for
the
students
and
potential
childcare
issues
for
the
families
while
the
extra
hour
and
a
half
of
school
time
could
provide
additional
educational
opportunities
it
is
important
to
consider
the
balance
of
benefits
and
risks
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
one
of
the
most
crucial
components
of
personal
well being
is
self esteem
having
strong
self esteem
allows
us
to
make
balanced
decisions
build
meaningful
relationships
and
have
a
positive
attitude
toward
life
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
role
that
praising
and
achieving
can
play
in
rising
our
self esteem
when
we
make
an
effort
and
receive
positive
praise
it
can
give
us
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment
leading
to
a
boost
in
our
self esteem
it
can
make
us
feel
appreciated
and
validated
reinforcing
the
belief
that
we
are
worthwhile
and
capable
individuals
similarly
when
we
attain
a
goal
or
an
achievement
it
can
be
extremely
rewarding
and
can
provide
us
with
a
great
sense
of
pride
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
that
comes
from
praise
and
achievements
can
help
cultivate
and
sustain
our
self esteem
allowing
us
to
face
any
future
challenge
with
courage
and
optimism
through
this
we
can
become
more
confident
in
our
potentials
and
be
driven
to
continue
to
make
an
effort
to
reach
our
goals
therefore
it
is
essential
to
recognize
and
make
use
of
the
positive
influences
that
praising
and
achievements
can
have
on
our
self esteem
by
recognizing
their
potential
impact
we
can
cultivate
a
strong
sense
of
self worth
and
appreciation
for
our
unique
abilities
this
is
essential
for
a
healthy
and
balanced
lifestyle
i
love
visiting
the
park
it
s
the
perfect
place
for
me
to
relax
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
nature
while
also
getting
some
physical
exercise
for
starters
i
love
to
go
for
a
jog
around
the
park
s
path
a
few
times
a
week
it
allows
me
to
keep
my
body
in
shape
stay
active
and
enjoy
some
fresh
air
plus
i
can
observe
all
of
the
tranquil
nature
around
me
on
weekends
i
love
to
bring
my
family
to
the
park
and
spend
some
quality
time
together
we
like
to
picnic
play
catch
and
take
a
stroll
around
the
area
this
time
allows
us
to
share
quality
memories
and
unwind
in
addition
the
park
provides
a
great
way
to
connect
with
the
people
around
me
from
cute
family
moments
to
bonding
with
friends
the
people
i
meet
at
the
park
always
bring
a
smile
to
my
face
ultimately
the
park
is
a
great
place
to
relax
take
a
break
from
the
stresses
of
life
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
world
i
still
vividly
remember
the
moment
when
i
arrived
in
a
new
country
for
the
first
time
there
i
was
standing
in
a
strange
place
ready
to
embark
on
a
new
journey
with
my
friends
and
sister
despite
the
fear
of
the
unknown
i
was
determined
to
make
the
best
of
this
exciting
opportunity
visiting
with
my
friends
and
sister
was
an
unforgettable
experience
that
i
will
forever
cherish
we
explored
the
city
taking
in
its
unique
sights
and
sounds
we
experienced
the
culture
and
the
history
in
a
way
no
textbook
or
lecture
ever
could
my
first
day
at
school
was
daunting
but
i
was
up
to
the
challenge
i
was
determined
to
face
my
new
environment
with
an
open
mind
and
to
make
the
most
of
my
educational
experience
with
hard
work
and
a
strong
support
system
i
overcame
academic
and
social
boundaries
these
experiences
have
left
a
lasting
impression
on
me
i
have
learned
so
much
about
myself
and
the
world
i
live
in
from
visiting
to
integrating
into
a
new
school
these
experiences
have
taught
me
the
values
of
resilience
adaptability
and
growth
they
will
stay
with
me
forever
in
s
words
never
be
idle
no
person
will
have
occasion
to
complain
of
the
want
of
time
who
never
loses
any
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
these
words
evoke
an
idea
that
is
still
relevant
in
society
today
the
importance
of
not
being
idle
with
a
global
pandemic
having
affected
much
of
our
everyday
life
it
is
more
important
than
ever
for
young
people
to
stay
busy
and
productive
through
s
words
young
people
are
not
only
inspired
to
make
use
of
their
free
time
constructively
but
also
strive
to
help
others
with
the
current
state
of
the
world
we
can
come
together
by
taking
action
to
combat
destructive
idling
this
could
look
like
volunteering
in
local
food
banks
finding
creative
ways
to
engage
with
friends
and
family
online
or
even
taking
up
a
new
hobby
no
matter
how
big
or
small
the
contributions
are
we
can
all
do
our
part
to
not
be
idle
ultimately
s
words
help
us
recognize
the
importance
of
not
being
idle
and
how
it
can
both
challenge
and
motivate
us
to
strive
to
better
our
society
by
using
our
time
wisely
we
can
all
come
together
and
make
a
difference
for
future
generations
one
of
the
most
beneficial
educational
activities
is
learning
and
practicing
art
engaging
in
art
whether
it
is
drawing
painting
sculpting
or
any
other
kind
of
creative
endeavor
has
many
advantages
that
help
us
in
both
our
personal
and
professional
lives
it
is
well
documented
that
engaging
in
creative
activities
such
as
art
can
reduce
stress
levels
and
promote
an
overall
feeling
of
wellbeing
this
is
particularly
important
from
a
mental
health
standpoint
as
we
can
often
find
ourselves
dealing
with
anxiety
and
even
depression
due
to
various
life
experiences
the
skills
and
knowledge
one
can
gain
from
an
art based
education
can
also
be
incredibly
useful
in
pursuing
a
career
there
are
many
opportunities
to
explore
in
the
art
world
from
becoming
a
professional
artist
or
designer
to
different
types
of
jobs
in
the
industry
such
as
managing
or
marketing
it
is
becoming
more
important
for
people
to
possess
a
strong
skillset
that
includes
creative
thinking
provides
us
with
the
opportunity
to
hone
our
creative
skills
and
view
the
world
in
different
ways
moreover
people
who
go
into
a
career
related
to
art
often
cite
their
interest
and
experience
from
an
early
age
proving
that
art
provides
a
valuable
foundation
to
grow
upon
overall
engaging
in
art
is
an
immensely
enjoyable
educational
activity
with
tremendous
potential
to
positively
impact
our
lives
it
provides
numerous
mental
and
physical
benefits
and
can
play
an
instrumental
role
in
people
finding
their
career
paths
and
discovering
their
passions
we
all
have
unique
personalities
and
regardless
of
our
similarities
our
individual
traits
are
what
make
us
stand
out
people
can
have
a
bad
day
for
a
variety
of
reasons
exhaustion
and
feeling
overwhelmed
can
all
lead
to
a
poor
mood
some
people
may
struggle
with
depression
or
anxiety
it
s
important
to
take
the
time
to
recognize
the
reasons
why
you
re
feeling
stressed
or
overwhelmed
and
tackle
the
issues
head on
first
impressions
are
not
necessarily
who
a
person
is
people
can
grow
and
change
over
time
and
they
can
choose
to
challenge
their
first
impressions
of
one
another
and
create
deeper
relationships
it
s
important
to
give
people
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
spend
time
getting
to
know
the
people
you
meet
and
take
the
time
to
understand
them
instead
of
judging
them
on
a
surface
level
together
we
can
work
to
prevent
snap
judgments
and
build
a
strong
foundation
of
mutual
respect
excerpt
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
school
days
should
be
extended
beyond
hours
is
a
controversial
one
that
has
generated
widely
differing
opinions
on
one
hand
there
are
those
who
feel
that
longer
school
days
would
allow
for
more
educational
opportunities
while
on
the
other
there
are
those
who
argue
that
it
would
lead
to
increased
frustration
and
burnout
among
students
in
this
essay
i
will
examine
the
argument
that
school
days
should
not
be
extended
beyond
hours
considering
the
impact
this
would
have
on
students
who
have
part time
jobs
as
well
as
the
impact
on
their
ability
to
participate
in
extra curricular
activities
every
for
the
next
two
months
i
ll
dedicate
my
morning
to
cleaning
the
house
i
ll
start
by
vacuuming
and
dusting
all
of
the
rooms
as
well
as
wiping
down
surfaces
like
windowsills
and
countertops
once
that
s
done
i
ll
move
on
to
mopping
the
floors
and
scrubbing
the
bathrooms
i
ll
make
sure
to
get
into
all
the
nooks
and
crannies
so
that
the
house
is
spotless
by
doing
this
regularly
i
ll
be
able
to
practice
and
improve
my
house
cleaning
skills
graduating
from
college
in
three
years
instead
of
four
years
is
a
great
idea
that
should
be
considered
by
university
administrators
doing
so
would
reduce
the
amount
of
time
and
money
spent
on
education
for
students
allowing
them
to
enter
the
workforce
or
pursue
higher
education
much
sooner
the
idea
of
graduating
college
within
a
shorter
period
of
time
than
four
years
is
not
a
new
concept
some
universities
already
offer
three year
undergraduate
programs
and
these
programs
are
successful
and
effective
students
are
taking
the
same
number
of
credits
taking
advanced
classes
and
graduating
at
the
same
rate
as
those
in
four
year
degree
programs
this
demonstrates
that
graduating
college
in
three
years
is
not
only
feasible
but
also
highly
beneficial
for
students
looking
to
join
the
workforce
after
college
quickly
three year
programs
would
help
them
start
their
careers
sooner
and
begin
making
money
bachelor
s
degree
takes
time
and
money
to
acquire
but
having
it
in
three
years
instead
of
four
would
make
it
more
accessible
to
those
for
whom
four year
degrees
may
not
be
feasible
students
would
be
able
to
access
more
opportunities
with
higher
pay
more
quickly
due
to
their
accelerated
timeline
the
additional
time
would
also
give
them
the
opportunity
to
pursue
graduate
studies
or
training
for
higher
paying
positions
more
quickly
in
addition
three year
programs
would
be
beneficial
for
universities
by
helping
them
save
on
money
and
resources
with
more
students
completing
their
studies
sooner
universities
would
save
on
housing
meals
tuition
fees
and
other
expenses
allowing
them
to
operate
more
efficiently
for
all
of
these
reasons
universities
should
consider
allowing
students
to
graduate
in
three
years
instead
of
four
it
would
be
beneficial
to
everyone
involved
and
would
help
ensure
that
everyone
who
wants
to
pursue
a
college
degree
is
able
to
do
so
in
a
practical
and
efficient
way
growing
up
my
parents
taught
me
to
always
stay
humble
and
true
to
myself
this
lesson
has
stayed
with
me
my
entire
life
and
continues
to
shape
my
character
i
have
taken
this
humble
nature
and
used
it
to
help
me
keep
my
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
in
all
of
life
s
challenges
it
helps
me
to
stay
self aware
and
critically
think
through
situations
before
acting
rashly
however
i
have
also
adopted
traits
from
the
people
i
admire
most
traits
that
challenge
me
to
push
and
take
chances
this
has
helped
me
become
more
courageous
forceful
and
passionate
about
my
goals
while
it
may
have
been
beneficial
for
me
to
take
these
on
i
must
be
careful
not
to
do
so
at
the
expense
of
my
humble
nature
this
brings
me
back
to
the
idea
of
whether
or
not
i
truly
have
total
control
of
my
character
on
the
one
hand
it
feels
as
though
i
have
fully
embraced
the
traits
my
parents
taught
me
and
i
am
certainly
making
conscious
decisions
to
adopt
certain
character
traits
from
others
on
the
other
hand
i
can
never
truly
know
how
my
upbringing
environment
and
even
genetics
have
contributed
to
forming
my
character
all
i
know
is
that
no
matter
what
i
will
continue
to
strive
to
be
the
best
version
of
myself
this
summer
join
us
for
a
week
of
fun
activities
games
sports
donation
drives
and
picnics
at
a
national
park
near
you
on
each
of
the
seven
days
we
will
host
different
activities
for
people
and
animals
in
need
such
as
a
volleyball
tournament
a
mini golf
tournament
a
run
book
drives
pet
adoption
events
and
more
all
are
welcome
to
attend
and
we
encourage
community
involvement
in
the
week
of
events
end
the
week
with
a
celebratory
party
with
music
food
and
a
chance
to
connect
with
your
fellow
park goers
let
s
be
the
change
and
create
a
brighter
future
for
people
and
animals
alike
when
discussing
the
pros
and
cons
of
changing
the
school
menu
for
the
benefit
of
student
health
and
academic
performance
it
is
important
to
consider
both
sides
on
one
hand
providing
students
with
healthy
meals
provides
the
essential
nutrients
and
energy
needed
to
focus
in
class
and
refrain
from
getting
sick
studies
have
shown
that
students
who
regularly
eat
healthful
school
lunches
tend
to
have
higher
grade
point
averages
and
miss
fewer
days
of
school
for
example
a
study
conducted
at
a
high
school
in
found
that
students
who
ate
school
lunches
had
higher
grades
than
those
who
brought
their
own
on
the
other
hand
changing
the
school
menu
may
present
more
challenges
than
benefits
as
schools
transition
to
healthier
options
students
may
not
take
the
change
positively
leading
to
lack
of
interest
in
the
meals
and
potential
food
waste
some
students
may
require
additional
dietary
accommodations
that
may
not
be
available
in
the
new
menu
furthermore
although
healthier
options
can
be
more
expensive
school
budgets
are
limited
having
to
pay
for
these
meals
could
place
an
additional
burden
on
students
and
families
ultimately
the
key
is
providing
students
with
healthy
options
that
are
both
delicious
and
affordable
when
it
comes
to
getting
advice
it
s
often
best
to
consult
with
multiple
people
by
having
a
variety
of
perspectives
on
a
subject
from
different
people
you
can
get
a
better
idea
of
what
the
right
decision
is
for
you
people
often
seek
advice
on
matters
such
as
career
paths
relationships
financial
decisions
or
life
decisions
hearing
different
perspectives
from
a
range
of
people
can
be
beneficial
and
help
provide
a
comprehensive
outlook
asking
for
advice
is
an
opportunity
to
learn
something
new
people
often
bring
up
useful
information
that
you
may
not
have
known
previously
you
might
hear
of
new
ideas
and
opportunities
or
even
be
presented
with
tools
and
resources
that
can
help

curfews
are
laws
or
regulations
that
restrict
the
movement
of
teenagers
in
public
places
during
certain
hours
of
the
day
usually
at
night
they
are
often
instituted
by
governments
or
private
organizations
such
as
schools
in
order
to
protect
teenagers
from
engaging
in
risky
or
illegal
behavior
proponents
of
curfews
argue
that
they
reduce
the
likelihood
of
crime
and
that
they
can
also
act
as
a
parental
tool
for
monitoring
their
child
s
activities
on
the
other
hand
opponents
of
curfews
argue
that
restricting
movement
of
young
people
unfairly
interferes
with
their
basic
rights
and
stifles
creativity
and
personal
development
in
some
cases
curfews
have
been
effective
in
curbing
juvenile
crime
in
particular
areas
for
example
in
the
city
of
local
officials
observing
a
decrease
in
crime
in
areas
where
the
curfew
was
introduced
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
cases
where
curfews
have
had
a
detrimental
impact
on
young
people
for
instance
in
the
an
curfew
introduced
during
the
coronavirus
outbreak
has
had
adverse
effects
on
teenagers
mental
health
with
some
feeling
isolated
and
lonely
due
to
the
lack
of
social
contact
in
conclusion
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
associated
with
curfews
it
appears
that
curfews
can
be
useful
in
keeping
teenagers
out
of
trouble
in
some
cases
however
they
can
also
interfere
with
their
rights
and
limit
their
activities
in
other
cases
the
efficacy
of
curfews
ultimately
depends
on
the
particular
situation
and
context
in
which
they
are
instituted
in
s
statement
on
the
importance
of
failure
he
argued
that
failure
is
crucial
for
individuals
seeking
success
identifying
with
this
idea
i
think
of
a
time
in
my
life
when
i
failed
and
subsequently
achieved
success
when
i
got
a
low
grade
on
a
maths
test
i
worked
harder
to
properly
understand
the
material
and
ultimately
did
well
in
the
following
tests
similarly
i
can
think
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
failed
his
first
driving
test
but
worked
to
understand
driver
safety
laws
better
and
passed
the
test
the
second
time
in
both
of
these
cases
failure
was
necessary
for
success
in
agreement
with
i
believe
failure
is
an
essential
part
of
the
process
of
achieving
long term
success
s
statement
that
one
s
character
is
chosen
by
oneself
is
widely
accepted
as
one
of
the
fundamental
truths
of
life
although
it
is
important
to
be
taught
proper
behavior
and
etiquette
by
our
parents
and
the
people
around
us
ultimately
how
we
act
and
think
is
determined
by
ourselves
alone
in
certain
circumstances
it
can
be
advantageous
to
make
adjustments
to
our
character
mindset
and
goals
it
is
possible
to
transform
our
character
in
order
to
overcome
any
limitations
and
help
not
only
ourselves
but
others
too
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
and
making
sure
that
our
character
is
founded
in
goodness
and
integrity
is
an
integral
part
of
fulfilling
our
potential
and
making
the
most
of
our
lives
throughout
his
life
was
an
advocate
for
setting
ambitious
goals
and
taking
risks
regardless
of
the
outcome
he
said
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
this
sentiment
resonates
today
as
we
look
to
examples
of
taking
risks
and
setting
big
goals
one
example
can
be
seen
in
the
popular
television
show
here
contestants
put
it
all
on
the
line
in
a
high stakes
cook off
showing
the
importance
of
setting
big
goals
and
having
the
courage
to
risk
failure
to
achieve
success
on
a
more
personal
level
many
of
us
can
look
to
our
own
lives
for
examples
perhaps
you
set
a
goal
to
pass
your
permit
test
taking
a
risk
and
studying
hard
you
take
the
test
with
the
anticipation
and
fear
of
failure
looming
in
the
back
of
your
mind
when
you
find
out
you
have
passed
the
test
you
are
rewarded
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
taken
the
risk
worked
hard
and
accomplished
your
goal
in
the
end
it
s
important
to
take
the
advice
of
and
others
to
heart
taking
risks
and
failing
can
be
intimidating
and
even
frightening
but
it
is
often
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
greater
successes
as
said
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
taking
risks
can
make
us
better
people
and
can
help
us
to
reach
heights
we
might
not
have
achieved
otherwise
first
impressions
can
be
deceiving
and
sometimes
it
s
not
until
we
know
someone
better
that
we
realize
their
true
character
despite
popular
belief
these
first
impressions
can
be
changed
over
time
one
example
of
this
comes
from
my
own
personal
experience
my
best
friend
in
high
school
was
someone
i
initially
thought
i
had
nothing
in
common
with
we
had
completely
different
personalities
and
interests
so
much
so
that
we
rarely
shared
a
conversation
let
alone
became
friends
forward
to
college
and
we
re
now
more
like
siblings
than
friends
despite
our
different
backgrounds
she
was
a
first generation
immigrant
from
and
i
m
from
a
rural
background
halfway
across
the
world
we
ve
grown
to
understand
each
other
and
found
areas
of
shared
interest
that
have
helped
bond
us
closer
than
ever
this
is
further
supplemented
by
scientific
evidence
that
supports
the
idea
that
first
impressions
can
be
changed
in
a
study
conducted
in
the
journal
and
it
was
found
that
one
s
perception
of
another
person
can
be
modified
with
knowledge
this
knowledge
often
comes
in
the
form
of
connecting
with
shared
interests
or
gaining
a
true
understanding
of
the
other
person
s
true
character
this
in
turn
allows
for
the
development
of
a
meaningful
relationship
that
alters
the
initial
perception
of
the
other
persons
traits
in
conclusion
first
impressions
are
not
always
accurate
and
can
be
changed
this
is
evident
in
my
own
personal
experience
as
well
as
in
various
scientific
studies
that
have
been
conducted
understanding
the
true
character
of
a
person
or
gaining
an
understanding
of
shared
interests
has
the
potential
to
change
the
perception
of
a
first
impression
allowing
for
a
strong
connection
in
today
s
world
the
pressure
of
conformity
is
ever increasing
making
it
important
for
individuals
to
stand
out
and
embrace
freedom
of
action
and
thought
is
fundamental
for
achieving
a
sense
of
self
as
it
allows
one
to
explore
and
discover
their
own
identity
outside
the
scope
of
society
s
expectations
with
the
freedom
to
choose
and
act
according
to
one
s
own
desires
an
individual
can
develop
a
sense
of
autonomy
and
self assuredness
that
in
turn
can
lead
to
personal
growth
as
an
example
consider
someone
who
wishes
to
pursue
their
passions
and
dreams
and
find
fulfillment
in
life
having
freedom
of
thought
and
action
means
this
individual
is
free
to
explore
these
possibilities
free
to
make
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
free
to
internalize
new
values
and
develop
their
own
beliefs
these
activities
when
done
with
purpose
can
help
teach
an
individual
valuable
life
lessons
and
increase
their
sense
of
identity
instilling
within
them
the
confidence
to
reach
for
greater
heights
it
is
clear
that
having
freedom
of
action
and
thought
is
essential
in
a
society
that
pressures
conformity
without
it
an
individual
can
easily
be
led
away
from
their
true
identity
because
of
external
expectations
thus
it
is
important
to
remain
true
to
oneself
and
not
be
swayed
by
influences
and
to
continue
to
explore
new
ideas
and
opportunities
in
order
to
maximize
personal
growth
for
the
past
three
years
has
experienced
many
changes
in
its
political
and
social
climate
in
the
country
experienced
a
peaceful
revolution
that
saw
resign
from
his
position
and
a
new
take
office
his
policies
of
openness
decentralization
and
economic
reform
have
fostered
unprecedented
economic
growth
and
improved
foreign
relations
the
gains
made
by
the
new
government
however
have
not
been
universal
and
tensions
remain
between
some
ethnic
groups
the
changes
in
have
had
a
profound
effect
on
my
life
and
relationships
with
family
and
friends
as
an
ethiopian
born
and
raised
abroad
i
have
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
with
the
rapid
changes
in
the
country
that
affect
the
lives
of
those
back
home
i
have
been
more
reconnected
to
my
culture
now
more
than
ever
before
however
as
more
of
my
friends
and
family
have
felt
emboldened
to
share
their
stories
and
experiences
there
is
a
renewed
sense
of
pride
in
the
community
and
this
has
helped
build
closer
bonds
with
friends
and
family
in
and
abroad
self belief
is
an
integral
part
of
success
and
is
a
building
block
to
be
able
to
strive
forward
and
be
successful
to
nurture
positive
self belief
one
must
take
on

both
physically
and
mentally
making
good
choices
and
being
conscious
of
the
consequences
of
the
decisions
that
we
make
can
be
key
in
becoming
successful
being
positive
is
crucial
in
building
confidence
and
creating
positive
outcomes
making
mistakes
which
are
often
viewed
negatively
can
in

be
learning

that
can

utilized
to
make

and
better
ourselves
in
the
process
examining
the
idea
of
positive
self belief
and
its
ability
to
lead
us
to
success
is
essential
for
self betterment
and
growth

classes
have
become
increasingly
popular
for
students

only
do
these
classes
provide
convenience
they
also
offer
safety
improved
focus
and
the
assurance
of

many
parents
who
homeschool
their
children
struggle
to
provide
them
in person
educational
opportunities
especially
with
the
already
reduced
resources
available
to
homeschooled
students
and
video
conferencing
classes
allow
homeschooled
students
to
access
a
variety
of
classes
often
from
the
comfort
and
safety
of
their
own
home
this
reduces
the
worrying
parents
often
have
about
their
children
being
exposed
to
bad
influences
outside
of
home
additionally
online
classes
provide
a
level
of
focus
that
can
be
hard
to
replicate
in
a
traditional
classroom
setting
without
the
distractions
of
other
students
or
teachers
the
student
is
able
to
stay
focused
on
the
content
and
work
more
efficiently
when
it
comes
to
a
homeschooled
student
this
concentrated
form
of
learning
is

it
can
enhance
their
academic
skills
and
levels
of
understanding
all

classes
are
ideal
for
homeschooled
students
whether
it
be
for
safety

or
to
avoid
bad
influences
these
classes
can
be
a
great
asset
to
any
homeschooling
curriculum
when

break
from
the
everyday
grind
of
work

may
enjoy
the
structure
that
a
yearly
school
schedule
provides
the
benefits
of
having
longer
school
holidays
and
more
frequent

can

be
overlooked
taking

provides
an

benefits
providing

opportunity
for
relaxation
growth
and
creating
lasting
memories
no
matter
how
hard
we
try
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
have
the
exact
same
life
experiences
that
someone
else
has
had
single
one
of
us
has
our
own
individual
path
through
life
that
gives
us
a
unique
perspective
of
the
world
around
us
while
the
circumstances
that
brought
us
to
this
moment
are
different
they
have
shaped
us
and
created
the
people
we
are
today
when
it
comes
to
living
other
people
s
experiences
the
answer
is
n t
a
simple
yes
or
no
we
can
empathize
with
someone
else
s
story
and
feel
similar
emotions
as
them
we
might
have
the
same
emotion
from
a
similar
situation
even
if
it
did
n t
happen
to
us
but
it
s
never
going
to
be
the
exact
same
we
may
also
observe
and
learn
from
the
experiences
of
other
people
and
take
what
we
learn
and
apply
it
in
our
own
life
however
the
experience
wo
n t
be
the
exact
same
since
we
have
n t
actually
lived
it
first hand
ultimately
we
have
to
create
our
own
life
experiences
and
explore
what
this
world
has
to
offer
while
we
can
observe
and
learn
from
the
experiences
of
others
we
must
also
embrace
our
own
journey
through
life
and
make
the
most
of
it
as
the
saying
goes
you
ll
never
know
till
you
try
while
we
can
understand
other
people
s
life
stories
we
will
never
experience
them
in
the
same
way
it
s
ok
to
take
ideas
or
lessons
from
their
experiences
but
in
the
end
we
all
have
to
create
our
own
unique
path
once
wrote
in
every
work
of
genius
we
recognize
our
own
rejected
thoughts
they
come
back
to
us
with
a
certain
alienated
majesty
this
is
a
reminder
to
stop
and
think
before
we
do
something
for
in
doing
so
we
open
a
wealth
of
possibilities
that
spark
creativity
and
innovation
when
it
comes
to
financial
decision making
this
is
critical
taking
the
time
to
research
and
analyze
the
different
options
available
is
important
in
order
to
make
the
best
choice
for
example
when
deciding
whether
to
take
out
a
loan
for
a
house
or
a
car
careful
thoughts
must
be
given
in
order
to
determine
which
option
is
the
best
additionally
investing
in
stocks
or
mutual
funds
must
likewise
be
carefully
considered
since
there
is
always
a
risk
of
losing
money
if
the
wrong
financial
decisions
are
made
this
concept
of
thinking
before
doing
is
equally
applicable
to
other
aspects
of
daily
life
before
making
a
purchase
people
can
explore
different
ways
of
getting
the
item
they
need
such
as
looking
for
discounts
and
coupons
or
buying
used
in
relationships
it
helps
to
take
a
step
back
and
thoughtfully
consider
our
feelings
and
actions
before
responding
to
difficult
situations
in
any
scenario
taking
the
time
to
think
before
jumping
into
a
decision
leads
to
better
outcomes
every
year
millions
of
people
around
the
world
exercise
their
right
to
elect
their
leaders
through
the
democratic
process
as
citizens
it
is
our
duty
to
understand
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
election
process
to
ensure
that
we
make
informed
decisions
similarly
it
is
important
to
have
an
understanding
of
and
similar
military like
programs
knowing
the
pros
and
cons
of
these
great
programs
can
help
us
better
decide
if
they
are
right
for
us
we
can
also
look
to
many
successful
people
for
guidance
and
motivation
when
trying
to
reach
our
career
goals
researching
these
stories
and
seeing
how
they
achieved
their
goals
can
be
very
beneficial
in
our
own
pursuits
along
the
same
line
it
is
important
to
understand
the
impact
of
planning
in
our
lives
and
take
time
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
will
guide
us
towards
our
desired
objective
finally
obtaining
experience
in
the
field
is
essential
if
you
want
to
understand
it
and
eventually
work
in
it
taking
the
time
to
make
sure
you
are
properly
informed
and
well experienced
can
make
all
the
difference
all
in
all
by
doing
your
research
and
taking
the
time
to
consider
your
plan
for
the
future
you
can
be
well
on
your
way
to
acquiring
the
job
you
intended
to
work
for
when
it
comes
to
seeking
advice
or
opinions
it
is
always
beneficial
to
consult
more
than
one
person
consulting
multiple
sources
of
knowledge
and
experience
can
provide
different
perspectives
and
better
inform
the
decision making
process
additionally
relying
on
a
more
diverse
base
of
sources
can
help
to
mitigate
the
risk
of
bias
and
reduce
the
possibility
of
making
a
bad
decision
on
the
other
hand
if
advice
is
only
being
sought
from
a
single
source
they
may
lack
the
breadth
of
knowledge
needed
furthermore
the
advice
from
one
single
person
also
contains
the
potential
of
being
biased
as
they
may
have
their
own
personal
agenda
and
motivations
recently
i
was
considering
starting
my
own
business
and
needed
some
advice
i
decided
to
ask
family
members
friends
and
colleagues
who
had
been
successful
entrepreneurs
and
gathered
their
advice
based
on
their
experiences
after
taking
the
time
to
listen
to
everyone
s
opinion
i
was
able
to
make
a
more
informed
and
well rounded
decision
on
which
path
to
pursue
failure
is
an
important
yet
often
uncomfortable
part
of
life
it
can
cause
a
decrease
of
hope
enthusiasm
and
faith
and
make
people
feel
like
their
efforts
are
futile
however
failure
can
also
be
used
to
motivate
people
to
succeed
by
understanding
the
mistakes
made
and
reflecting
on
how
to
do
better
in
the
future
we
can
build
up
our
resilience
and
prepare
for
future
challenges
for
instance
a
student
who
has
failed
a
test
may
take
time
to
analyze
the
mistakes
they
made
and
use
this
to
focus
their
future
efforts
this
forward thinking
can
help
the
student
develop
the
persistence
and
determination
to
succeed
however
success
does
not
always
come
from
failing
it
is
important
to
strive
for
success
on
the
path
up
to
it
as
well
as
learn
the
lessons
from
mistakes
along
the
way
successful
results
can
come
from
being
diligent
and
methodical
in
any
endeavor
in
the
century
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
way
humans
communicate
and
interact
with
each
other
to
laptops
tablets
and
smartphones
have
made
it
easier
and
faster
to
communicate
with
others
which
has
proven
to
be
both
a
positive
and
a
negative
aspect
of
technology
on
one
hand
communication
has
become
more
efficient
with
the
ability
to
instantly
get
in
touch
with
anyone
anytime
on
the
other
hand
spending
too
much
time
on
technology
can
lead
to
reduced
social
interaction
and
even
vision
problems
due
to
the
reliance
on
screens
additionally
technology
has
had
a
major
impact
on
libraries
and
their
role
in
society
as
the
majority
of
people
now
have
access
to
digital
books
and
other
forms
of
media
on
the
internet
fewer
people
visit
libraries
librarians
have
had
to
adapt
to
this
changing
trend
and
redirect
their
attention
to
providing
other
services
such
as
educational
programs
or
hosting
events
like
music
performances
considering
the
negative
effects
of
increased
technology
usage
it
is
important
to
limit
the
time
spent
on
technology
and
find
a
healthy
balance
it
can
be
helpful
to
set
boundaries
and
limit
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
screens
daily
additionally
we
should
give
ourselves
the
chance
to
connect
with
others
face
to
face
as
meaningful
interactions
are
fundamental
for
our
social
development
one
skill
i
have
mastered
is
problem solving
my
goal
is
to
become
even
better
at
it
by
developing
a
deeper
understanding
of
how
systems
work
and
being
more
creative
in
my
approach
to
devising
solutions
i
will
reach
this
goal
by
reading
more
books
on
complex
problem solving
immersing
myself
in
difficult
tasks
to
test
my
limits
and
having
discussions
with
others
to
come
up
with
new
ideas
i
must
remain
persistent
and
open minded
even
when
the
challenges
seem
insurmountable
through
stretching
myself
and
growing
with
each
setback
i
realize
the
importance
of
constantly
striving
to
improve
and
knowing
that
any
achievement
is
a
result
of
dedication
and
hard
work
having
a
good
attitude
in
life
is
strongly
associated
to
success
and
resilience
when
facing
challenging
situations
studies
have
shown
that
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
can
help
us
overcome
adversity
and
can
ultimately
lead
to
success
it
increases
our
capabilities
to
see
opportunity
rather
than
danger
in
the
face
of
failure
moreover
research
has
shown
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
make
it
easier
to
focus
on
tasks
and
circumvent
negative
emotions
positive
thinking
makes
it
easier
to
view
a
problem
as
a
challenge
instead
of
an
obstacle
despite
these
advantages
there
is
a
debate
about
whether
having
a
positive
attitude
is
necessary
for
success
there
is
evidence
that
hard
work
resilience
and
talent
are
all
equally
important
to
attaining
success
nonetheless
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
greatly
increases
the
chances
of
achieving
both
short term
goals
and
long term
objectives
in
summary
having
a
good
attitude
is
an
important
factor
for
becoming
successful
and
achieving
your
goals
it
gives
us
the
courage
to
face
difficult
situations
and
helps
us
to
channel
our
energy
into
productive
tasks
with
a
positive
attitude
we
can
reach
our
potential
and
achieve
our
ambitions
doing
school
work
at
home
offers
students
a
variety
of
benefits
one
of
the
main
advantages
is
the
opportunity
to
take
regular
breaks
and
regroup
before
tackling
another
task
this
can
help
students
stay
focused
and
engaged
while
completing
their
school
work
working
on
the
computer
is
also
a
great
benefit
as
students
are
able
to
track
their
progress
and
find
information
quickly
staying
with
family
can
also
provide
comfort
and
support
when
tackling
difficult
tasks
or
answering
challenging
questions
although
studying
and
completing
school
work
at
home
may
not
be
as
comfortable
as
being
in
the
classroom
it
can
lead
to
increased
levels
of
distraction
and
avoiding
procrastination
with
the
right
balance
of
productivity
and
breaks
doing
school
work
at
home
offers
students
a
variety
of
beneficial
learning
opportunities
is
an
action
of
showing
care
and
concern
for
others
it
is
a
quality
of
being
gentle
compassionate
and
considerate
people
choose
to
be
kind
because
it
reinforces
positive
values
reinforces
a
sense
of
belonging
and
brings
people
together
has
an
incredible
effect
on
people
not
only
strengthening
personal
relationships
but
often
leading
to
increased
productivity
and
morale
the
ripple
effect
of
kind
actions
is
far reaching
and
with
even
the
smallest
act
of
kindness
we
can
make
a
huge
difference
in
someone
s
life
contributes
to
our
overall
happiness
and
well being
and
is
an
important
factor
in
reducing
stress
and
depression
is
essential
to
creating
a
civil
and
supportive
society
with
a
brighter
future
for
us
all
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
power
of
kindness
and
practice
it
every
day
understanding
that
its
positive
effects
will
go
beyond
our
own
sphere
and
have
a
lasting
impact
on
all
of
those
around
us
in
today
s
world
it
is
of
paramount
importance
to
continue
to
learn
new
skills
and
information
both
for
success
and
personal
growth
emphasized
the
significance
of
this
by
noting
is
a
journey
not
a
destination
his
message
is
that
knowledge
is
obtained
through
the
journey
of
life
and
only
through
continual
learning
can
one
reach
their
goals
this
concept
is
evident
in
everyday
life
for
example
individuals
from
all
walks
of
life
may
take
a
class
to
learn
a
new
skill
such
as
a
coding
language
or
baking
by
engaging
in
such
activities
people
are
able
to
gain
knowledge
while
also
expanding
their
interests
and
gaining
insight
into
what
they
enjoy
education
is
key
when
it
comes
to
discovering
new
passions
researchers
have
long
noted
the
importance
of
education
in
discovering
new
interests
and
hobbies
studies
have
found
that
the
more
time
individuals
spend
with
their
studies
the
more
likely
they
are
to
discover
talents
and
interests
they
were
previously
unaware
of
it
is
these
activities
one
learns
through
their
studies
that
eventually
lead
to
a
career
or
pursuit
one
is
passionate
about
therefore
it
is
essential
to
continuously
push
yourself
further
in
life
despite
what
you
have
already
accomplished
by
engaging
in
learning
activities
individuals
not
only
prevent
stagnation
but
also
open
themselves
to
a
variety
of
opportunities
that
can
lead
to
personal
growth
and
success
in
a
world
of
constant
pressure
to
conform
it
can
be
difficult
to
truly
be
oneself
our
society
is
constantly
trying
to
change
us
to
mold
us
into
the
people
that
it
prefers
but
is
this
a
successful
pursuit
ultimately
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
in
the
world
being
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
attempting
to
change
the
person
you
are
to
understand
the
answer
to
this
question
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
meaning
behind
being
oneself
being
oneself
is
more
than
just
the
physical
attributes
that
make
up
a
person
s
identity
it
is
about
understanding
who
you
are
and
accepting
it
even
if
that
means
going
against
the
common
norm
being
able
to
stand
up
for
one
s
beliefs
no
matter
how
unpopular
they
may
be
is
a
key
part
of
being
oneself
to
be
true
to
oneself
in
a
world
that
is
trying
to
change
you
is
a
major
accomplishment
it
takes
courage
and
conviction
to
stay
true
to
oneself
in
the
face
of
opposition
doing
so
shows
that
not
only
have
you
accepted
yourself
but
that
you
are
capable
of
standing
up
for
something
you
believe
in
in
addition
it
can
be
educational
and
inspiring
to
those
that
may
follow
a
similar
path
it
may
give
them
the
confidence
to
follow
the
path
of
self acceptance
and
discovery
at
the
end
of
the
day
though
being
oneself
in
a
world
constantly
trying
to
change
the
person
you
are
can
be
a
daunting
task
it
is
a
great
accomplishment
that
should
be
celebrated
to
understand
and
accept
oneself
is
a
powerful
thing
and
it
should
be
recognized
and
its
power
should
be
recognized
the
greatest
accomplishment
in
the
world
can
be
being
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
attempting
to
change
the
person
you
are
in
my
opinion
extending
the
school
day
by
one
and
a
half
hours
is
a
bad
idea
the
additional
time
would
place
an
undue
burden
on
students
drivers
and
teachers
for
students
the
extra
time
spent
in
the
classroom
would
leave
less
time
for
homework
activities
and
family
time
all
of
which
contribute
to
physical
and
mental
health
for
drivers
it
would
mean
more
kids
on
the
road
during
rush
hour
potentially
leading
to
dangerous
situations
and
delays
finally
for
teachers
it
would
mean
longer
days
with
more
lesson
plans
to
create
and
teach
all
in
all
i
think
that
extending
the
school
day
is
not
a
good
idea
it
could
lead
to
dangerous
and
negative
situations
for
students
drivers
and
teachers
alike
there
are
better
ways
to
improve
education
that
do
n t
rely
on
cutting
into
the
precious
time
students
have
for
other
activities
my
first
impression
of
someone
may
not
be
particularly
accurate
societal
norms
and
expectations
personal
biases
or
even
the
way
someone
is
dressed
can
all
affect
our
initial
opinion
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
full
perspective
of
someone
s
character
personality
or
values
just
by
first
impressions
people
can
be
much
more
complex
than
we
give
them
credit
for
and
sometimes
it
takes
a
second
or
even
a
third
look
to
get
a
better
idea
of
who
they
are
although
first
impressions
can
be
helpful
in
some
situations
forming
too
strong
of
an
opinion
or
judgement
based
off
of
minimal
information
can
be
hazardous
people
should
take
their
own
time
in
getting
to
know
someone
s
decency
intelligence
and
overall
character
before
assuming
they
shaped
the
complete
accurate
picture
overall
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
our
first
impressions
are
the
most
important
when
getting
to
know
somebody
we
should
leave
room
for
change
understanding
and
growth
in
getting
to
know
someone
and
not
rely
solely
on
surface level
features
when
faced
with
the
expectations
of
society
and
family
it
can
be
easy
to
lose
sight
of
yourself
in
the
process
in
today
s
world
it
is
increasingly
important
to
stay
true
to
yourself
no
matter
how
much
pressure
is
applied
being
true
to
yourself
has
the
potential
to
provide
numerous
benefits
such
as
improved
overall
well being
and
a
sense
of
personal
meaning
when
you
remain
true
to
yourself
even
when
it
conflicts
with
external
influences
you
will
be
able
to
feel
more
confident
and
in
control
of
your
life
you
will
find
yourself
surrounded
by
people
that
accept
and
respect
you
for
who
you
are
you
will
find
that
when
you
stand
up
for
yourself
and
refuse
to
compromise
who
you
are
for
the
sake
of
others
you
will
experience
a
newfound
sense
of
self empowerment
it
is
understandable
to
feel
caught
between
the
expectations
of
society
and
family
it
can
be
overwhelming
to
know
that
you
re
constantly
being
judged
and
pressurized
the
choices
we
make
in
such
situations
can
be
difficult
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
the
end
your
sense
of
self
is
what
really
matters
if
you
stay
true
to
your
identity
and
goals
in
life
you
will
be
able
to
live
your
best
life
so
take
a
stand
and
stay
true
to
yourself
when
you
say
no
to
outside
expectations
and
pressures
you
will
gain
social
and
personal
empowerment
and
eventually
self confidence
happiness
and
a
sense
of
purpose
will
follow
learning
and
attending
classes
at
school
both
have
their
benefits
and
drawbacks
learning
such
as
online
coursework
can
allow
for
more
flexibility
in
terms
of
when
and
where
instruction
is
completed
it
can
also
allow
students
to
engage
with
course
material
on
their
own
terms
taking
more
or
less
time
as
needed
for
understanding
however
online
courses
are
often
more
self directed
and
as
such
may
require
that
students
have
strong
self discipline
or
adequate
support
to
ensure
that
the
material
is
correctly
completed
attending
classes
at
school
still
offers
its
advantages
such
as
personal
engagement
with
teachers
and
peers
as
well
as
having
fixed
end points
to
curriculum
namely
semesters
or
quarters
in
the
classroom
teachers
are
available
to
help
guide
students
with
any
issues
they
encounter
and
the
structure
of
the
classroom
serves
to
facilitate
focus
on
mastering
material
that
said
the
physical
limitations
of
attending
classes
can
also
paint
a
challenge
for
students
who
have
to
work
around
a
set
school
schedule
and
who
may
not
always
be
able
to
attend
or
complete
their
coursework
in person
in
conclusion
there
are
advantages
and
drawbacks
to
each
system
of
learning distance
learning
can
offer
more
freedom
in
terms
of
when
and
how
to
engage
with
course
material
while
attending
classes
can
offer
more
structure
and
personal
connection
with
a
teacher
ultimately
the
choice
of
system
may
depend
on
an
individual
s
personal
needs
and
learning
style
our
characters
are
shaped
by
a
variety
of
influences
both
external
and
internal
we
are
influenced
by
the
people
we
interact
with
and
the
environment
around
us
as
well
as
by
our
own
personal
thoughts
and
feelings
these
influences
are
often
outside
of
our
control
and
can
profoundly
affect
our
development
even
our
genetics
and
upbringing
can
shape
who
we
become
something
we
have
no
control
over
despite
this
i
still
believe
that
it
is
possible
for
people
to
choose
their
own
path
if
they
are
determined
enough
to
do
so
there
are
countless
examples
of
individuals
who
have
overcome
difficult
situations
and
created
lives
for
themselves
that
exemplify
strength
and
perseverance
this
brings
me
hope
for
our
world
today
and
while
some
aspects
may
seem
dire
i
have
faith
that
we
can
create
a
better
future
if
we
can
strive
to
do
better
and
be
the
change
we
wish
to
see
imagination
can
provide
a
solution
to
the
unanswerable
can
turn
obstacles
into
opportunities
and
can
create
a
path
where
none
existed
before
imagination
is
essential
both
in
our
personal
as
well
as
our
professional
lives
because
it
enables
us
to
cast
aside
the
limits
of
knowledge
and
see
the
bigger
picture
take
for
instance
a
young
child
are
able
to
use
their
imagination
in
amazing
ways
to
conjure
up
stories
pictures
or
objects
of
their
own
making
parents
and
educators
often
praise
this
sort
of
creative
thinking
as
it
allows
the
child
to
take
risks
free
from
the
anxiety
of
being
wrong
more
importantly
imagination
can
be
used
to
bridge
gaps
for
the
differently abled
for
the
blind
for
example
it
is
not
knowledge
that
might
help
a
person
find
his
or
her
way
but
rather
the
ability
to
imagine
one
s
surroundings
it
is
imagination
that
allows
them
to
visualise
a
street
corner
or
a
store
and
to
traverse
a
path
that
may
have
been
previously
unknown
in
conclusion
imagination
is
considered
more
important
than
knowledge
because
it
is
far
more
versatile
powerful
and
adaptive
it
is
the
tool
we
need
when
knowledge
fails
us
it
is
the
key
to
creative
thinking
and
it
allows
for
a
measure
of
flexibility
and
creativity
that
knowledge
alone
can
not
offer
when
it
comes
to
making
decisions
many
of
us
grapple
with
the
question
of
whether
to
go
it
alone
or
to
seek
guidance
from
those
more
experienced
on
the
one
hand
seeking
professional
advice
can
provide
us
with
the
specialized
expertise
necessary
to
tackle
complicated
situations
on
the
other
hand
making
one
s
own
decisions
can
provide
a
sense
of
independence
and
self ownership
for
me
i
value
both
my
liberty
and
security
i
value
my
freedom
to
be
independent
and
make
decisions
that
reflect
my
own
interests
and
i
also
recognize
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
sense
of
safety
and
stability
as
such
it
s
important
for
me
to
strike
a
balance
between
trusting
my
instincts
and
trusting
the
wisdom
of
experts
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
particularly
important
when
it
comes
to
matters
of
personal
values
no
one
knows
me
better
than
i
know
myself
so
i
m
well
aware
of
the
values
and
life
matters
that
are
most
important
to
me
with
that
being
said
when
it
comes
to
more
complicated
or
technical
matters
i
believe
it
s
wise
to
seek
counsel
from
professionals
to
ensure
i
make
the
best
possible
decisions
in
the
end
it
s
up
to
me
to
choose
between
making
my
own
decisions
or
seeking
expert
guidance
ultimately
whether
i
decide
to
go
it
alone
or
take
advantage
of
the
wisdom
of
others
i
am
responsible
for
the
outcome
that
s
why
in
the
end
i
must
always
trust
my
own
instincts
and
values
when
making
decisions
that
will
impact
my
life
pushing
yourself
beyond
your
current
level
of
mastery
is
essential
to
achieving
true
success
when
you
take
the
initiative
to
go
beyond
a
skill
already
mastered
you
open
yourself
up
to
new
opportunities
gain
new
perspectives
and
build
a
portfolio
of
experiences
that
can
help
you
stand
out
from
the
crowd
with
each
challenge
successfully
completed
you
gain
a
greater
understanding
of
yourself
strengthen
your
existing
skills
and
develop
new
ones
there
is
no
way
to
move
forward
without
taking
risks
and
the
only
way
to
expand
your
boundaries
and
find
new
success
is
by
taking
the
initiative
to
research
and
try
something
new
and
difficult
for
many
of
us
the
thought
of
becoming
an
engineer
is
equal
parts
intimidating
and
exciting
growing
up
i
knew
that
i
had
potential
to
become
a
successful
engineer
but
i
had
to
commit
to
a
rigorous
educational
pursuit
and
develop
important
skills
in
order
to
succeed
after
extensive
research
i
found
engineering
jobs
could
vary
greatly
in
terms
of
qualifications
and
tasks
but
one
common
requirement
was
the
need
to
have
certain
technical
skills
to
me
this
was
both
a
challenge
and
a
potential
advantage
while
developing
the
necessary
skills
required
a
lot
of
hard
work
i
also
realized
that
i
could
use
my
technical
knowledge
to
pursue
a
highly
rewarding
and
fulfilling
career
i
soon
found
that
engineering
jobs
weren
t
just
filled
with
complex
tasks
there
were
also
multiple
benefits
from
financial
stability
to
a
sense
of
accomplishment
engineering
jobs
allowed
me
to
use
my
intellect
in
unique
ways
through
these
jobs
i
was
able
to
learn
valuable
lessons
in
both
practical
and
theoretical
aspects
of
my
chosen
field
i
was
also
reminded
of
the
importance
of
organizational
and
problem solving
skills
which
are
essential
for
any
successful
engineer
while
i
had
my
own
experiences
with
engineering
one
of
the
most
motivational
things
i
did
was
to
explore
success
stories
of
engineers
as
well
reading
about
famous
engineers
and
their
accomplishments
provided
me
with
a
newfound
appreciation
and
respect
for
the
profession
i
was
also
inspired
by
their
perseverance
and
adaptability
which
i
found
to
be
the
key
qualities
required
for
being
successful
in
the
field
of
engineering
in
hindsight
i
agree
that
the
challenges
i
faced
were
worth
it
the
time
and
effort
put
into
learning
key
skills
and
tasks
paid
off
as
i
now
have
a
fulfilling
engineering
job
that
i
enjoy
attending
school
with
the
goal
of
pursuing
a
career
can
be
beneficial
for
both
high
school
students
and
teachers
by
taking
the
initiative
to
explore
various
career
paths
while
in
high
school
students
gain
valuable
insight
into
their
interests
passions
and
skills
with
the
proper
guidance
and
resources
from
experienced
teachers
they
can
solidify
their
career
direction
which
can
prove
beneficial
as
they
transition
out
of
high
school
and
into
college
or
the
workplace
additionally
students
can
gain
valuable
real world
experience
before
they
even
enter
the
workforce
by
taking
courses
related
to
their
chosen
career
field
they
can
develop
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
job
the
required
skills
and
the
benefits
that
come
with
it
for
teachers
such
initiatives
provide
a
great
opportunity
to
shape
the
next
generation
of
professionals
and
fully
invest
in
their
development
through
mentorship
and
support
they
can
contribute
to
students
career
success
and
prepare
them
for
the
future
visiting
has
been
something
i
have
been
dreaming
of
ever
since
i
first
heard
about
the
city
and
its
friendly
atmosphere
i
imagine
it
to
be
a
vibrant
and
exciting
place
with
a
unique
culture
and
plenty
of
attractions
i
am
sure
that
the
people
of
are
some
of
the
most
welcoming
and
hospitable
people
i
have
ever
met
they
are
a
diverse
group
that
respects
all
kinds
of
cultures
and
backgrounds
making
it
an
extremely
open minded
area
to
visit
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
experience
this
firsthand
the
environment
of
also
draws
me
closer
to
wanting
to
visit
the
small
shops
bustling
markets
and
colorful
architecture
all
make
the
city
seem
alive
and
full
of
life
it
would
be
a
one of a kind
experience
to
explore
and
fully
take
in
all
the
wonders
of
this
fascinating
city
i
am
sure
visiting
would
be
a
lovely
and
memorable
experience
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
explore
the
unique
personality
of
the
city
and
get
to
know
the
people
that
call
it
home
i
am
sure
that
i
would
feel
right
at
home
in
this
vibrant
and
friendly
city
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
offers
some
potential
advantages
as
well
as
disadvantages
on
the
one
hand
students
who
manage
to
complete
all
of
their
required
coursework
in
less
time
can
start
college
earlier
this
can
also
mean
saving
on
the
cost
of
courses
and
room
and
board
on
the
other
hand
for
many
students
there
is
a
need
to
mature
and
gain
some
life
experience
after
their
high
school
years
so
rushing
into
college
may
not
be
the
best
option
in
the
end
whether
or
not
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
is
the
right
choice
for
a
student
should
be
considered
on
an
individual
basis
there
are
numerous
factors
to
consider
from
academic
readiness
to
social
development
and
each
student
must
evaluate
if
this
approach
will
help
them
reach
their
academic
and
personal
goals
seeking
advice
from
trusted
sources
when
making
important
decisions
is
a
wise
course
of
action
i
have
personally
sought
and
followed
advice
that
has
yielded
both
good
and
bad
results
providing
me
with
valuable
insight
on
why
it
should
be
sought
the
first
reason
why
advice
should
be
sought
is
that
it
can
provide
different
perspectives
when
i
was
choosing
which
college
to
attend
i
sought
advice
from
my
parents
my
teachers
and
peers
which
gave
me
many
different
opinions
and
viewpoints
on
the
best
choice
each
individual
had
different
experiences
and
advice
that
helped
me
make
a
better
decision
the
second
reason
why
advice
should
be
sought
is
to
get
guidance
on
difficult
decisions
for
example
when
deciding
whether
to
start
my
own
business
i
asked
financial
advisors
mentors
and
entrepreneurs
who
had
extensive
knowledge
and
experience
in
the
field
their
advice
on
both
the
risks
and
potential
rewards
of
launching
my
own
business
helped
to
inform
my
decision
the
third
reason
why
advice
should
be
sought
is
to
get
help
developing
plans
and
strategies
before
embarking
on
a
big
project
i
often
consult
other
people
who
have
done
similar
projects
before
their
advice
has
proved
invaluable
in
helping
me
plan
out
a
step by step
process
for
success
overall
consulting
trusted
sources
for
advice
is
an
important
part
of
making
informed
decisions
personal
experiences
i
have
had
have
provided
me
with
undeniable
proof
of
the
value
of
seeking
advice
and
i
will
continue
to
use
this
useful
resource
in
all
of
my
important
decisions
learning
how
to
deal
with
stressful
situations
and
difficult
problems
can
be
hard
however
it
is
essential
in
order
to
face
and
solve
them
in
a
productive
and
healthy
way
here
are
some
tips
and
advice
on
how
to
face
and
solve
problems
take
a
step
back
and
assess
the
situation
objectively gaining
a
better
understanding
of
the
problem
can
help
define
the
steps
needed
to
fix
it
break
the
problem
into
smaller
steps accomplishing
smaller
tasks
can
be
less
overwhelming
and
lead
to
the
bigger
picture
ask
for
help telling
a
friend
or
family
member
about
a
problem
can
help
to
ease
the
burden
and
create
a
plan
of
action
for
example
being
bullied
is
a
difficult
life
problem
that
can
be
solved
it
s
important
to
talk
to
a
trusted
adult
like
a
teacher
parent
or
guidance
counselor
to
address
the
issue
if
the
problem
is
already
out
of
hand
consider
contacting
the
authorities
for
help
facing
and
solving
this
problem
can
have
many
beneficial
outcomes
it
can
bring
an
increased
sense
of
self confidence
and
self
worth
to
know
that
the
problem
has
been
handled
and
no
longer
has
control
over
your
life
it
can
also
provide
a
newfound
appreciation
for
the
people
that
supported
you
and
helped
to
end
the
bullying
it
is
essential
to
tell
a
friend
or
family
about
a
problem
in
order
to
be
met
with
support
and
helpful
advice
a
problem
shared
is
a
problem
halved
as
the
old
saying
goes
and
oftentimes
it
can
help
to
speak
about
it
with
someone
that
can
offer
guidance
knowing
that
you
aren
t
alone
and
that
someone
is
there
with
you
can
give
the
strength
you
need
to
handle
any
difficult
problem
technology
has
changed
the
way
we
communicate
research
and
game
on
one
hand
its
use
has
made
information
more
accessible
and
enabled
us
to
communicate
faster
and
more
efficiently
for
example
social
media
platforms
allow
people
from
around
the
world
to
connect
and
share
content
instantly
research
can
now
be
done
online
and
searching
for
data
is
far
quicker
and
more
convenient
than
ever
before
has
also
become
all
the
more
immersive
and
interactive
with
the
help
of
technology
and
players
can
now
enjoy
a
wider
range
of
gaming
experiences
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
be
a
distraction
for
some
people
for
example
communication
through
social
media
can
be
superficial
and
lacks
the
personal
interaction
of
face to face
communication
the
sheer
amount
of
data
available
online
can
also
be
overwhelming
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
sieve
through
and
verify
all
of
the
facts
some
gaming
platforms
can
be
addictive
and
can
quickly
become
more
important
to
people
than
activities
such
as
physical
exercise
or
pursuing
other
hobbies
in
conclusion
technology
has
its
pros
and
cons
it
has
made
our
lives
easier
in
many
ways
but
it
can
also
be
a
hindrance
especially
if
it
is
not
used
responsibly
education
has
grown
rapidly
over
the
past
decade
providing
convenient
and
flexible
opportunities
for
students
to
learn
by
taking
into
account
the
diverse
needs
of
students
educators
can
take
advantage
of
online
education
to
make
up
for
missed
school
days
due
to
personal
health
or
sports
considerations
additionally
remote
learning
can
ensure
that
students
are
not
disadvantaged
by
weather related
cancellations
minimizing
disruptions
to
schooling
and
online
classrooms
offer
their
own
unique
advantages
and
disadvantages
management
is
an
important
factor
to
consider
in
online
classrooms
students
are
often
responsible
for
establishing
their
own
study
time
whereas
an
instructor
can
structure
a
traditional
classroom
to
ensure
that
learning
time
is
used
efficiently
online
learning
can
be
less
distracting
as
students
have
more
control
over
their
environment
that
said
online
education
can
be
lonely
and
isolating
as
students
miss
out
on
conversations
and
collaborations
with
their
peers
as
such
it
is
important
to
weigh
all
potential
factors
before
deciding
between
an
online
or
in person
learning
environment
all
in
all
online
education
can
meet
a
variety
of
needs
often
allowing
students
to
learn
in
a
more
flexible
manner
that
suits
their
individual
needs
with
careful
consideration
of
time
management
distractions
and
potential
isolation
remote
learning
can
be
advantageous
for
students
with
missed
school
days
or
weather related
interruptions
when
researching
everyday
life
in
and
the
states
it
is
important
to
take
into
consideration
the
various
customs
family
dynamics
clothing
education
and
discipline
methods
in
each
place
generally
food
in
the
states
is
more
processed
and
convenience based
than
in

where
traditional
made from scratch
home cooked
meals
are
more
common
clothing
in
ranges
from
everyday
casual
to

whereas
in
clothing
is
more
casual
and
the
focus
is
more
on
practicality
in
and
family
is
typically
very
central
to
life
while
in
the
states
families
may
have
more
distance
between
them
educational
values
vary
as
in
families

prioritize
education
for
their

more
on
growing
up
quickly
and
with
minimal
schooling
also
varies
with
stricter
structures
in

and
more
relaxed
attitudes
in
the

comparisons
like
this
can
help
one
reflect
on
their
outlook
on
life
and
their
place
in
the
world
in
different
countries
can
offer
insight
into
new
ways
of
thinking
and
looking
at
the
world
expanding
one
s
horizons
and
experiences
understanding
the
experiences
of
those
around
us
can
help
us
foster
compassion
connection
and
appreciation
for
the
beauty
and
diversity
of
the
human
experience
technology
has
revolutionized
the
lives
of
people
all
around
the
world
on
one
hand
it
has
brought
unimaginable
convenience
and
comfort
allowing
us
to
stay
connected
with
one
another
more
quickly
and
easily
than
ever
before
it
has
also
made
discovering
new
information
and
sources
of
entertainment
easier
and
more
accessible
than
ever
before
on
the
other
hand
it
has
created
an
over
reliance
on
technology
in
many
aspects
of
our
lives
and
caused
many
of
us
to
become
more
isolated
from
each
other
and
more
disconnected
from
meaningful
activities
outside
of
our
screens
the
ubiquity
of
the
online
world
has
also
opened
the
door
for
greater
cyber
security
risks
and
threats
to
our
data
privacy
ultimately
technology
can
be
a
double edged
sword
and
its
effects
on
our
lives
will
depend
largely
on
how
we
use
it
s
quote
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
is
one
of
the
most
inspiring
quotes
of
the
modern
era
on
one
hand
s
quote
highlights
the
fact
that
success
while
valuable
is
not
static
and
there
is
always
more
to
be
done
this
encourages
individuals
to
strive
for
continuous
improvement
and
progress
in
their
lives
on
the
other
hand
s
quote
is
n t
complete
without
addressing
failure
to
achieve
success
one
must
not
be
discouraged
by
failure
but
to
use
it
as
a
learning
experience
and
keep
going
with
determination
and
courage
i
relate
to
this
quote
personally
when
i
was
in
graduate
school
i
struggled
to
keep
up
with
my
classes
and
often
felt
adrift
however
i
used
s
words
as
a
source
of
hope
and
motivation
regardless
of
my
failures
i
had
the
courage
to
push
on
and
eventually
graduate
with
much
success
this
quote
spoke
to
me
directly
and
showed
me
that
failure
was
just
a
necessary
step
in
the
journey
to
success
ultimately
s
quote
is
a
potent
reminder
that
it
is
never
too
late
to
start
again
and
to
continue
striving
for
excellence
no
matter
the
setbacks
encountered
no
matter
how
difficult
the
journey
becomes
the
courage
and
determination
to
continue
will
allow
one
to
eventually
reach
their
goals
the
quest
for
individuality
is
a
key
part
of
finding
our
own
path
in
life
to
remain
true
to
our
convictions
and
steer
away
from
the
opinions
of
others
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
commitment
to
ourselves
and
our
beliefs
this
commitment
should
not
be
talked
away
because
when
we
go
back
on
our
word
we
are
only
fooling
ourselves
true
accomplishments
are
achieved
when
focus
is
steadfast
and
we
are
mindful
of
the
purpose
behind
our
aims
to
remain
focused
it
is
important
to
take
regular
breaks
and
measure
our
progress
against
our
goals
when
any
extraneous
noise
arises
be
it
from
external
or
internal
sources
it
is
important
to
resist
becoming
distracted
and
to
stay
accountable
to
our
self determined
targets
in
this
way
we
can
achieve
great
accomplishments
and
avoid
succumbing
to
the
opinions
of
those
around
us
recent
studies
have
shown
that
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
academic
performance
and
student
engagement
has
shown
that
students
who
spend
more
time
on
their
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
tend
to
have
lower
grades
and
decreased
engagement
in
class
activities
in
order
to
make
the
use
of
cell
phones
more
effective
in
the
classroom
it
is
recommended
that
schools
set
clear
boundaries
and
rules
to
limit
the
amount
of
time
students
spend
on
their
cell
phones
during
class
time
other
potential
solutions
include
providing
students
with
learning
apps
and
programs
to
use
on
their
cell
phones
that
are
related
to
the
subject
they
are
learning
in
class
as
well
as
giving
students
more
incentive
to
stay
off
their
phones
and
focus
on
their
studies
after
researching
the
potential
impact
of
shortening
the
duration
of
public
high
school
from
four
years
to
three
it
is
clear
that
there
could
be
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
such
a
change
on
the
positive
side
a
three year
program
could
give
students
the
opportunity
to
enter
college
or
the
workforce
one
year
earlier
than
those
in
a
four year
program
allowing
them
to
fast track
their
educational
or
career
pursuits
however
it
could
also
alienate
those
who
would
have
otherwise
benefitted
from
an
additional
year
of
high
school
such
as
those
looking
to
improve
their
academic
scores
or
those
needing
an
extra
year
to
acclimate
to
the
pre university
or
employment
environment
ultimately
the
decision
to
pursue
three
years
of
high
school
should
take
into
account
several
other
factors
these
could
include
students
academic
readiness
levels
the
availability
of
extracurriculars
and
support
services
and
the
larger
socio economic
environment
that
will
affect
a
student
s
educational
and
career
prospects
based
on
these
considerations
it
is
clear
that
every
individual
must
evaluate
the
risks
and
benefits
of
a
three year
high
school
program
against
their
own
personal
circumstances
and
the
potential
impact
of
the
decision
on
their
future
success
studying
science
and
at
offers
two
very
different
experiences
each
with
its
own
advantages
science
is
a
constantly
evolving
field
with
new
advances
and
techniques
being
discovered
daily
the
school
provides
expert
guidance
and
modern
equipment
making
it
an
ideal
place
to
explore
the
complex
theories
and
technologies
of
the
subject
in
contrast
offers
an
opportunity
to
delve
into
the
past
and
investigate
the
origins
of
our
civilization
and
culture
through
lectures
and
field
trips
s
expert
faculty
provides
students
with
a
solid
foundation
of
knowledge
in
the
subject
while
also
allowing
them
to
study
and
discuss
unique
interpretations
of
traditional
narratives
both
and
have
their
advantages
but
in
the
end
it
comes
down
to
each
individual
student
s
interests
and
goals
if
you
are
passionate
about
understanding
the
complexities
of
our
world
then
studying
is
the
perfect
choice
if
on
the
other
hand
you
enjoy
delving
into
the
past
and
uncovering
the
stories
of
our
ancestors
then

path
you
choose

provide
the
guidance
you
need
to
succeed
and
make
the
most
of
your
studies
when
it
comes
to
schools
having
local
partnerships
there
are
various
risks
and
rewards
involved
on
one
hand
schools
can
benefit
from
the
expertise
and
resources
that
companies
bring
to
the
table
they
can
also
provide
students
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
industry
and
potential
career
paths
they
can
explore
on
the
other
hand
this
collaboration
requires
communication
trust
and
a
lot
of
effort
to
ensure
that
both
parties
come
away
with
a
positive
outcome
challenges
that
come
with
forming
partnerships
can
range
from
not
understanding
the
company
s
values
and
goals
to
different
levels
of
commitment
between
schools
and
businesses
on
the
other
hand
benefits
of
collaboration
can
include
access
to
mentors
and
resources

learning
opportunities
and
more
diverse
classroom
learning
experiences
successful
businesses
with
local
partnerships

create
positive
lasting
changes
within
their
communities
for
example
schools
with
strong
business
partnerships
may
have
access
to
new
technologies
mentors
and
community
resources
this
can
help
students
stay
engaged
in
their
studies
and
equip
them
with
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
additionally
these
partnerships
can
open
doors
for
students
offering
internships
and
job
prospects
while
helping
the
community
grow
in
the
process
through
careful
consideration
and
thoughtful
partnerships
schools
have
the
potential
to
become
a
much
needed
source
of
hope
and
opportunity
for
students
the
risks
and
rewards
of
having
a
partnership
with
a
local
company
should
be
carefully
weighed
out
in
order
to
maximize
the
benefits
for
students
by
exploring
these
implications
and
establishing
strategies
that
help
students
succeed
schools
can
create
an
environment
that

there
are
many
benefits
to
reducing
time
spent
in
high
school
for
students
the
exertion
of
taking
multiple
classes
can
often
be
mentally
and
physically
draining
making
it
difficult
to
stay
motivated
and
engaged
reducing
a
student
s
course
load
in
high
school
allows
them
more
time
to
focus
and
invest
in
activities
outside
of
the
classroom
that
broaden
their
educational
experiences
in
the

ultimately
being
organized
and
motivated
can
offer
many
benefits
from
improved
productivity
to
increased
confidence
in
achieving
success
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
in
life
school
work
and
sports
there
is
an
old
adage
that
you
can
go
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
this
means
that
it
is
possible
to
be
resilient
to
failure
and
to
continuously
persist
in
the
pursuit
of
our
goals
is
often
overlooked
as
a
vital
ingredient
to
our
success
but
it
can
be
a
powerful
motivator
it
can
give
us
the
hope
and
courage
to
continue
on
our
journey
despite
the
hardships
and
setbacks
that
we
may
face
moreover
enthusiasm
is
contagious
if
we
can
tap
into
this
positivity
and
spread
it
to
those
around
us
we
can
help
to
inspire
and
motivate
them
to
do
the
same
by
never
allowing
ourselves
to
be
discouraged
by
failure
and
instead
projecting
enthusiasm
and
optimism
we
can
find
the
strength
and
motivation
to
keep
pressing
forward
on
our
path
to
success
is
the
foundation
for
feelings
of
self worth
and
courage
and
can
be
cultivated
from
positive
affirmations
provided
by
others
studies
have
shown
that
we
are
more
likely
to
reach
goals
and
feel
secure
when
we
receive
positive
affirmations
from
those
around
us
in
oneself
and
others
can
also
help
to
build
self esteem
bolstering
confidence
and
resilience
to
illustrate
an
individual
who
may
have
previously
felt
lack
of
faith
in
their
ability
to
complete
a
task
may
receive
praise
from
an
adult
for
their
progress
thus
far
this
well intentioned
encouragement
can
be
a
large
motivator
for
the
individual
as
it
helps
make
them
feel
capable
and
affirmed
in
their
mission
it
also
shows
that
there
are
people
around
who
believe
in
them
and
trust
their
potential
adults
have
an
important
opportunity
to
provide
affirmation
to
younger
individuals
to
support
and
build
self esteem
through
providing
these
positive
affirmations
adults
have
the
privilege
of
creating
an
encouraging
atmosphere
a
sense
of
security
and
a
safe
environment
to
learn
and
grow
recent
studies
on
the
effects
of
distance
learning
on
students
learning
outcomes
have
shown
both
pros
and
cons
on
one
hand
students
who
attend
classes
from
home
are
able
to
learn
in
an
environment
that
is
tailored
to
their
own
individual
learning
styles
this
can
provide
a
more
engaging
learning
experience
compared
to
traditional
classrooms
as
students
are
in
charge
of
their
own
learning
pace
and
environment
however
students
attending
classes
from
home
can
suffer
from
issues
concerning
socialization
responsibility
and
experience
without
face to face
communication
many
important
learning
and
life
skills
such
as
team
work
public
speaking
and
interpersonal
communication
are
lost
also
there
is
comparatively
a
lack
of
responsibility
and
guidance
for
progress
when
in
an
online
setting
overall
the
future
of
distance
learning
for
students
remains
at
the
very
least
uncertain
for
those
who
struggle
to
learn
in
a
traditional
setting
distance
learning
can
provide
a
great
alternative
equally
traditional
classrooms
are
still
preferred
by
some
for
a
number
of
reasons
such
as
social
connection
and
assessment
feedback
it
is
important
that
students
are
given
the
option
to
choose
between
the
two
learning
methods
in
order
to
create
an
ideal
learning
environment
education
has
a
profound
impact
on
both
individual
economic
and
social
outcomes
and
global
economic
and
social
conditions
education
can
provide
individuals
with
opportunities
to
develop
the
skills
and
knowledge
necessary
to
succeed
in
the
workforce
thereby
improving
their
individual
economic
prospects
it
can
also
empower
people
to
have
a
greater
voice
in
their
communities
and
participate
more
fully
in
their
societies
additionally
education
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
global
economic
and
social
outcomes
by
creating
a
more
educated
and
productive
workforce
when
it
comes
to
accessing
higher
education
there
are
a
number
of
different
approaches
governments
can
offer
student
loans
scholarships
and
grants
to
make
higher
education
more
accessible
private
companies
nonprofits
and
other
organizations
can
also
step
in
to
provide
financing
for
students
or
establish
scholarships
for
underserved
communities
additionally
students
can
use
crowdfunding
to
raise
money
for
their
educations
or
take
on
part time
or
full time
jobs
to
cover
tuition
costs
there
are
many
examples
of
educational
efforts
that
have
been
successful
in
promoting
economic
development
or
reducing
poverty
for
instance
in
the
government
launched
a
program
to
provide
free
laptops
and
internet
access
to
economically
disadvantaged
students
which
has
resulted
in
a
reduction
in
poverty
in
the
region
in
a
program
to
train
teachers
in
the
use
of
technology
has
enabled
students
to
access
online
courses
and
educational
resources
that
otherwise
would
not
have
been
available
in
order
to
make
higher
education
more
accessible
governments
and
other
organizations
need
to
create
policies
and
programs
that
focus
on
reducing
the
financial
barriers
that
prevent
individuals
from
attending
college
this
could
include
providing
more
financial
aid
expanding
student
loan
and
grant
programs
and
providing
tax
credits
to
those
who
pay
tuition
additionally
more
needs
to
be
done
to
fund
and
support
initiatives
that
help
students
access
the
resources
they
need
to
complete
their
education
finally
education
can
be
used
as
a
tool
to
create
economic
opportunities
for
people
individuals
can
use
their
education
to
start
businesses
and
develop
products
that
will
benefit
their
communities
and
economies
education
can
also
help
to
increase
the
productivity
of
businesses
as
workers
can
use
their
skills
and
knowledge
to
increase
efficiency
and
lower
costs
in
this
way
education
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
reducing
poverty
and
promoting
economic
development
taking
a
four day
weekend
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
both
mental
and
physical
health
researchers
have
found
that
taking
a
break
even
for
a
few
days
can
help
to
refuel
and
refresh
the
mind
and
body
for
one
having

extended
weekend
can
help
to
reduce
stress
levels
from
the
daily
pressures
of
work
and
life
this
can
help
to
restore
a
feeling
of
calm
and
balance
which
can
be
beneficial
for
physical
health
moreover
having
the
extra
day
can
allow
us
to
engage
in
activities
we
don
t
otherwise
have
time
for
such
as
socializing
with
family
and
friends
taking
the
time
to
relax
or
doing
something
for
self care
furthermore
having
a
four day
weekend
can
have
many
benefits
for
schools
the
environment
employers
and
employees
for
schools
it
could
grant
students
an
additional
day
to
get
organized
study
or
attend

technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
both
in
the
workplace
and
in
our
personal
lives
while
the
advances
made
possible
by
technology
have
been
beneficial
for
many
they
have
also
made
it
easier
for
us
to
become
over reliant
on
digital
resources
and
lose
our
natural
connection
with
people
and
our
environment
one
of
the
biggest
dangers
of
technology
is
its
potential
to
negatively
affect
our
physical
and
mental
health
prolonged
exposure
to
blue
light
emitted
by
electronic
devices
can
disrupt
our
natural
circadian
rhythms
causing
a
range
of
issues
including
insomnia
fatigue
and
mood
disturbances
additionally
too
much
time
spent
on
devices
is
linked
to
an
increase
in
feelings
of
depression
anxiety
and
stress
technology
can
also
impact
our
personal
relationships
the
prevalence
of
social
media
sites
and
messaging
apps
has
given
our
phone
screens
priority
over
in person
interactions
preventing
us
from
developing
deeper
connections
with
those
closest
to
us
fortunately
technology
does
have
the
potential
to
be
used
responsibly
limiting
our
exposure
to
blue
light
by
avoiding
screens
at
night
and
keeping
dedicated
tech free
time
is
one
way
to
ensure
technology
has
limited
negative
impacts
additionally
setting
boundaries
for
yourself
with
regard
to
social
media
use
can
help
foster
healthier
relationships
by
recognizing
the
potential
risks
of
technology
and
taking
steps
to
mitigate
them
we
can
ensure
technology
continues
to
be
an
asset
to
our
lives
impressions
the
initial
evaluation
of
another
person
or
situation
are
frequently
believed
to
be
highly
influential
and
resistant
to
change
many
studies
have
found
that
people
are
heavily
biased
toward
initial
impressions
once
formed
they
are
difficult
to
alter
for
example
in
the
business
world
an
individual
s
first
impression
is
often
used
as
the
basis
for
long term
judgements
about
their
personality
and
capabilities
also
research
has
consistently
shown
that
hiring
decisions
are
strongly
influenced
by
first
impressions
a
candidate
s
interview
appearance
mannerisms
and
written
resume
usually
play
a
major
role
in
the
ultimate
xdecision
overall
it
is
clear
that
first
impressions
often
make
a
lasting
impact
and
can
be
difficult
to
undo
research
has
shown
that
there
are
numerous
benefits
to
providing
healthier
food
options
in
school
cafeterias
studies
have
found
that
students
who
eat
healthier
balanced
meals
during
the
school
day
perform
better
in
class
have
higher
cognitive
functioning
and
feel
more
energized
and
ready
to
learn
introducing
healthier
snacks
such
as
fresh
fruits
vegetables
and
alternative
grains
can
help
counteract
the
effects
of
processed
and
sugary
snacks
that
are
popular
amongst
students
to
effectively
implement
healthier
food
options
in
school
cafeterias
the
following
steps
should
be
taken
conduct
an
audit
of
the
current
food
items
offered
in
the
school
lunchroom
survey
the
students
to
learn
their
preferences
for
healthy
snacks
nutritious
whole
foods
such
as
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
grains
seeds
and
nuts
as
well
as
plant based
substitutes
to
traditional
lunch
items
educate
the
students
on
the
importance
of
making
healthier
food
choices
set
aside
time
for
students
to
participate
in
activities
that
promote
healthy
eating
habits
establish
a
partnership
with
local
farmers
and
food
vendors
to
provide
fresh
wholesome
food
items
for
the
school
lunchroom
monitor
the
implementation
adjusting
the
plan
as
needed
seeking
advice
from
one
person
when
making
important
life
decisions
can
be
an
effective
approach
when
that
person
possesses
expertise
in
the
area
having
one
opinion
can
also
help
to
keep
the
decision making
process
more
organized
and
straightforward
on
the
other
hand
consulting
only
one
person
for
an
important
decision
may
limit
the
breadth
of
perspectives
on
the
issue
and
may
ignore
information
gaps
that
multiple
perspectives
could
fill
additionally
relying
on
the
opinion
of
one
person
could
increase
the
risk
of
bias
when
such
a
person
has
a
personal
interest
in
the
decision
being
made
getting
advice
from
multiple
people
when
making
an
important
life
decision
can
provide
valuable
insight
into
the
issue
and
may
help
to
capture
a
variety
of
perspectives
additionally
this
approach
may
reduce
the
risk
of
bias
due
to
the
larger
source
pool
of
advice
the
downside
of
using
multiple
people
as
sources
of
advice
is
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
manage
an
opinion
from
a
large
group
and
can
be
less
efficient
than
relying
on
the
counsel
of
a
single
source
according
to
research
students
typically
receive
far
more
break
time
throughout
the
school
year
than
non student
adults
a
week
break
in
the
summer
offers
students
time
to
relax
and
recharge
but
it
can
also
put
them
behind
in
their
academic
studies
when
school
re starts
similarly
a
longer
winter
break
may
give
students
more
time
to
prepare
for
upcoming
exams
but
some
may
neglect
their
studies
over
the
holidays
spring
and
fall
breaks
provide
a
nice
balance
between
the
short
summer
break
and
the
longer
winter
break
giving
students
a
week
to
rest
and
reset
midway
through
the
academic
year
students
who
use
the
summer
break
to
their
advantage
can
set
goals
such
as
gaining
professional
experience
by
securing
a
full time
job
or
saving
money
for
college
this
helps
them
to
prepare
for
the
future
as
well
as
establish
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
independence
this
can
in
turn
have
a
significant
impact
on
their
long term
success
and
the
skills
they
gain
over
summer
breaks
can
help
to
make
them
even
more
attractive
to
future
employers
playing
soccer
requires
a
certain
level
of
skill
and
dedication
in
order
to
succeed
practicing
regularly
can
help
to
improve
individual
skills
as
well
as
learning
tricks
and
techniques
that
can
make
a
difference
in
a
game
reaching
higher
levels
of
success
in
soccer
such
as
becoming
part
of
an
international
team
involves
challenging
oneself
and
pushing
beyond
comfort
zones
it
is
important
to
understand
that
success
does
n t
come
easy
and
involves
overcoming
obstacles
and
working
hard
in
order
to
grow
through
reflecting
on
life
experience
and
learning
from
mistakes
along
with
disciplined
practice
and
dedication
one
can
make
progress
towards
their
goal
of
soccer
success
the
debate
over
the
potential
pros
and
cons
of
switching
to
a
four day
ten hour
school
week
has
been
raging
for
some
time
proponents
of
this
idea
argue
that
it
could
provide
students
with
more
breaks
and
lighter
homework
loads
as
well
as
giving
them
more
time
to
explore
and
pursue
activities
beyond
the
classroom
on
the
other
hand
opponents
of
this
concept
worry
that
it
could
cause
kids
to
experience
fatigue
and
lack
of
focus
due
to
the
length
of
each
day
in
terms
of
advantages
there
is
the
potential
for
improved
student
productivity
due
to
the
shorter
but
longer
school
days
this
could
encourage
them
to
better
manage
their
time
become
more
organized
and
complete
tasks
more
efficiently
furthermore
the
extended
weekend
could
allow
for
good
recreational
activities
and
potentially
more
time
spent
with
family
on
the
flipside
the
downside
to
a
four day
ten hour
school
week
may
be
that
students
will
be
required
to
attend
school
for
a
much
longer
period
of
time
each
day
than
usual
this
could
lead
to
feelings
of
exhaustion
and
could
be
particularly
difficult
for
younger
students
who
are
already
more
susceptible
to
tiredness
additionally
it
could
cause
them
to
lose
valuable
time
with
friends
and
affect
their
social
development
ultimately
the
decision
to
adopt
or
reject
a
four day
ten hour
school
schedule
should
only
be
made
after
careful
consideration
of
both
its
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
it
is
important
for
administrators
to
keep
in
mind
that
an
effective
school
day
should
provide
students
with
a
balance
of
academic
and
extracurricular
activities
and
should
ensure
that
their
physical
and
mental
health
are
both
taken
into
account
i
ve
been
researching
different
job
options
and
discussing
them
with
my
parents
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
my
teachers
have
been
an
invaluable
resource
in
this
process
sharing
their
perspective
on
continuing
my
education
by
attending
a
community
college
or
taking
extra
classes
they
ve
emphasized
the
importance
of
considering
their
guidance
carefully
before
making
a
decision
although
this
process
of
research
and
deliberation
can
be
daunting
i
m
confident
that
i
m
on
the
right
track
is
a
student
in
my
class
who
is
having
trouble
understanding
our
course
material
i
believe
it
would
be
helpful
for
to
attend
after
school
classes
or
join
sports
to
help
him
increase
his
understanding
of
the
material
and
improve
his
grades
i
plan
to
meet
with
one on one
and
explain
why
these
activities
would
be
beneficial
i
will
explain
how
the
after
school
classes
and
sports
will
provide
an
opportunity
for
him
to
learn
in
more
depth
and
ask
questions
i
will
also
discuss
how
the
increased
physical
activity
could
help
him
stay
motivated
and
focused
in
class
lastly
i
ll
tell
about
another
student
in
our
class
who
was
struggling
academically
and
attended
after
school
classes
which
led
to
an
improvement
in
the
student
s
grades
after
this
conversation
it
is
my
hope
that
will
be
encouraged
to
enroll
in
these
activities
with
this
plan
i
am
confident
that
will
have
the
tools
to
succeed
in
the
classroom
decision
making
can
be
a
challenging
process
on
one
hand
making
your
own
decisions
and
being
independent
can
be
empowering
you
may
find
that
taking
ownership
of
things
and
making
your
own
decisions
grants
you
better
control
and
autonomy
you
also
may
develop
the
skills
to
make
sound
judgments
and
navigate
through
difficulties
on
the
other
hand
deciding
on
your
own
can
present
some
risks
it
s
possible
to
make
decisions
without
all
the
necessary
information
or
resources
furthermore
it
can
be
hard
to
remain
impartial
when
making
decisions
without
guidance
and
feedback
from
a
trusted
source
when
it
comes
to
making
major
decisions
taking
advice
from
an
experienced
professional
or
loved
one
can
help
you
weigh
the
potential
positive
and
negative
impacts
through
consulting
with
those
outside
your
own
perspective
you
can
gain
insights
that
you
wouldn
t
have
come
to
on
your
own
one
example
of
this
is
when
an
individual
faces
a
difficult
situation
such
as
where
to
go
to
college
a
career
move
or
investment
decision
seeking
advice
from
family
or
advisers
can
help
the
individual
gain
clarity
and
make
an
educated
assessment
of
the
situation
no
matter
how
you
choose
to
approach
your
decision
making
it
s
important
to
remember
that
the
choices
you
make
have
the
potential
to
cause
ripples
in
your
life
therefore
it
s
important
to
be
mindful
of
who
and
what
you
surround
yourself
with
phones
have
become
integral
elements
of
modern
life
so
it
is
no
surprise
that
their
use
in
the
classroom
has
been
receiving
much
attention
many
schools
and
universities
have
varying
policies
surrounding
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
learning
environments
ranging
from
complete
bans
to
learning
scenarios
that
include
cell
phone
use
arguments
for
and
against
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
can
be
found
on
both
sides
of
the
discussion
positively
cell
phones
can
offer
many
benefits
to
the
learning
process
enabling
students
to
access
information
quickly
and
easily
additionally
text
messaging
email
and
other
online
communication
tools
can
facilitate
collaboration
and
communication
between
students
and
teachers
phones
are
also
able
to
capture
photos
and
videos
that
students
can
use
for
research
projects
on
the
other
hand
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
has
shown
to
be
distracting
to
both
students
and
teachers
cellphones
can
be
used
to
cheat
on
tests
watch
videos
or
send
messages
if
not
monitored
properly
additionally
too
much
reliance
on
cell
phones
can
lead
to
students
not
learning
the
material
in depth
overall
the
effects
of
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
will
depend
heavily
on
the
policies
and
administration
monitoring
their
use
the
benefits
of
technology
must
be
balanced
with
the
possible
negative
impacts
to
ensure
a
safe
and
productive
learning
environment
setting
goals
and
working
hard
to
achieve
them
is
one
of
the
most
effective
strategies
for
success
goals
allow
us
to
focus
on
specific
areas
of
our
lives
we
wish
to
improve
and
provide
us
with
a
roadmap
for
reaching
those
goals
by
setting
realistic
goals
and
taking
steps
to
reach
them
we
can
move
closer
to
our
important
pursuits
unfortunately
there
are
those
who
utilize
deceit
or
unethical
behavior
to
reach
their
aims
lying
and
cheating
can
be
very
tempting
but
the
repercussions
are
often
much
greater
than
the
short term
benefits
many
often
forget
that
breaking
the
rules
and
pursuing
their
goals
dishonestly
can
lead
to
serious
consequences
that
include
severe
financial
penalties
loss
of
reputation
and
even
incarceration
in
the
end
it
s
important
to
remember
that
setting
goals
and
working
hard
to
achieve
them
is
the
most
productive
and
reliable
way
to
succeed
despite
the
temptations
of
lying
and
cheating
to
reach
our
objectives
the
long term
ramifications
can
be
too
costly
for
most
people
a
better
strategy
is
to
use
our
skills
time
and
resources
to
create
a
plan
that
will
sustain
our
success
over
the
long
term
recent
studies
have
shown
that
the
imposition
of
curfews
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
teenagers
and
their
communities
on
the
positive
side
curfews
can
lead
to
improved
safety
levels
as
they
restrict
the
number
of
hours
that
teens
can
be
out
and
potentially
engaging
in
risky
activities
additionally
curfews
can
lead
to
improved
morale
within
the
community
as
they
can
reduce
levels
of
vandalism
and
youth
delinquency
on
the
negative
side
curfews
can
be
disproportionately
enforced
and
teens
who
abide
by
the
rule
may
unfairly
be
suspected
of
criminal
activity
when
out
after
curfew
hours
furthermore
teens
may
express
feelings
of
resentment
or
entrapment
when
curfews
are
imposed
which
can
lead
to
an
erosion
of
general
trust
within
a
community
ultimately
when
considering
the
impact
of
curfews
on
teenagers
and
their
communities
it
is
important
to
consider
both
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
the
policy
making
decisions
is
an
essential
part
of
life
and
seeking
guidance
when
making
them
can
help
people
be
successful
and
achieve
their
goals
seeking
guidance
from
someone
with
a
different
perspective
can
help
broaden
one
s
understanding
of
a
situation
and
provide
a
better
perspective
on
how
to
proceed
guidance
from
those
who
have
been
in
similar
situations
or
have
similar
goals
and
interests
can
offer
more
accurate
advice
and
help
people
take
the
right
steps
to
achieve
their
goals
can
provide
reassurance
in
knowing
one
s
decisions
are
sound
guidance
can
provide
insight
into
potential
pitfalls
and
unfavorable
consequences
allowing
one
to
make
more
informed
decisions
and
avoiding
costly
mistakes
guidance
can
also
help
break
through
indecision
by
providing
support
and
encouragement
guidance
can
help
give
someone
the
confidence
to
make
decisions
and
move
forward
seeking
guidance
from
trusted
sources
is
important
in
making
sure
decisions
have
a
positive
outcome
guidance
can
help
widen
one
s
perspective
provide
reassurance
and
help
make
the
most
informed
decisions
possible
with
the
help
of
guidance
people
can
be
more
successful
in
life
and
achieve
their
dreams
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
essential
for
success
a
positive
outlook
can
lead
to
greater
satisfaction
and
success
in
school
work
and
relationships
it
can
help
to
boost
our
mood
and
engage
us
in
meaningful
activities
giving
us
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
to
persevere
through
challenges
positive
thinking
can
also
help
us
to
focus
on
solutions
rather
than
problems
and
create
greater
opportunities
for
growth
when
we
believe
in
ourselves
and
our
abilities
our
confidence
and
enthusiasm
can
manifest
in
all
areas
of
life
allowing
us
to
enjoy
a
more
fulfilling
and
successful
experience
having
a
positive
attitude
can
make
a
world
of
difference
in
our
lives
helping
us
to
achieve
our
goals
failure
often
has
a
negative
connotation
attached
to
it
but
this
statement
speaks
to
the
importance
of
failure
in
one
s
journey
to
success
is
not
an
end goal
that
can
be
achieved
in
one
stroke
of
genius
but
rather
an
ongoing
adventure
punctuated
by
failures
that
help
shape
our
progress
failure
can
teach
us
valuable
lessons
about
ourselves
and
our
experiences
and
serves
to
refine
our
methods
and
approaches
to
better
facilitate
our
success
understanding
this
makes
failure
less
daunting
and
more
a
necessary
part
of
the
equation
to
success
it
is
also
critical
to
have
an
enthusiastic
mindset
towards
failure
for
it
allows
us
to
reflect
and
analyze
our
mistakes
without
letting
them
bog
us
down
more
often
than
not
our
failures
point
us
in
the
direction
of
success
and
provide
us
with
the
knowledge
and
experience
we
need
to
finish
the
journey
for
without
failure
we
would
remain
in
a
state
of
comfortable
mediocrity
never
pushing
ourselves
beyond
our
limits
to
see
our
true
potential
in
conclusion
success
consist
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
is
a
powerful
statement
that
powerfully
encapsulates
the
role
of
failure
in
the
progress
towards
success
with
an
optimistic
outlook
towards
failure
we
can
use
it
to
our
advantage
and
find
our
true
path
to
success
the
principal
s
view
that
all
students
should
be
involved
in
a
sport
club
or
after
school
activity
is
an
interesting
one
that
warrants
serious
consideration
on
the
one
hand
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
benefits
of
student
participation
in
activities
of
this
kind
students
can
learn
teamwork
and
social
skills
have
the
opportunity
to
exercise
learn
additional
skills
and
compete
against
one
another
and
become
active
members
of
their
school
s
community
on
the
other
hand
it
is
important
to
consider
that
this
view
is
not
suitable
for
all
students
for
some
the
commitment
and
pressures
of
regular
activity
may
be
too
great
or
they
may
already
be
involved
in
activities
outside
of
school
that
already
fill
their
schedules
a
sensible
approach
is
necessary
in
which
all
students
are
encouraged
to
participate
in
as
many
activities
as
possible
but
no
one
is
left
feeling
overwhelmed
ultimately
the
principal
s
view
is
one
worth
considering
taking
into
account
a
balance
between
pressure
and
fun
has
been
my
best
friend
since
i
was
a
child
and
over
the
years
we
have
grown
together
just
like
the
way
homeschooling
is
different
from
traditional
school
allows
for
more
personal
growth
and
adaptability
that
conventional
schools
may
not
offer
was
instrumental
in
doing
projects
and
helping
me
through
tough
times
with
learning
more
than
just
academics
but
also
helping
me
navigate
the
complexities
of
growing
up
when
we
worked
together
on
art
projects
s
enthusiasm
gave
me
the
confidence
to
follow
through
and
complete
difficult
tasks
his
character
traits
of
helping
others
giving
advice
and
sharing
wisdom
have
encouraged
me
to
look
at
things
from
multiple
perspectives
with
his
mental
support
i
was
able
to
push
through
the
hurdles
of
my
projects
and
succeed
taught
me
many
valuable
lessons
and
i
am
thankful
for
his
selflessness
and
friendship
his
unconditional
friendship
allowed
us
both
to
become
more
resilient
and
wise
and
i
m
forever
grateful
to
have
such
a
great
friend
to
help
me
through
tough
times
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
could
have
both
beneficial
and
detrimental
effects
on
students
on
the
one
hand
a
longer
school
day
could
provide
more
time
for
learning
but
on
the
other
hand
it
could
lead
to
increased
fatigue
and
cognitive
impairment
in
students
many
students
currently
have
after school
jobs
so
two
additional
hours
could
limit
their
availability
and
slow
their
progress
additionally
implementing
a
four day
week
could
reduce
the
availability
of
time
to
socialize
and
have
free
time
ultimately
while
it
is
intended
to
increase
students
educational
success
the
potential
downsides
might
outweigh
the
benefits
when
considering
the
diverse
needs
of
all
students
for
these
reasons
the
current
school
day
should
not
be
extended
when
researching
how
important
professionalism
effort
and
dedication
are
in
succeeding
in
life
one
need
look
no
further
than
the
inspiring
story
of
his
perseverance
and
dedication
to
mastering
his
skills
has
earned
him
the
opportunity
to
become
one
of
the
best
professional
soccer
players
of
this
era
just
as
worked
hard
to
find
success
many
people
around
the
world
have
found
their
own
success
by
honing
their
skills
and
dedicating
themselves
to
mastering
their
craft
however
money
and
success
do
play
a
role
in
achieving
goals
s
success
was
partially
due
to
his
endorsement
deals
and
his
access
to
proper
training
it
is
worth
noting
that
not
everyone
has
access
to
the
same
amount
of
resources
and
thus
a
level
playing
field
does
not
always
exist
in
addition
some
people
may
become
distracted
by
the
pursuit
of
money
and
success
and
not
focus
on
honing
the
skills
that
will
truly
bring
them
success
to
conclude
it
is
clear
that
professionalism
effort
and
dedication
are
essential
to
succeeding
in
life
the
story
of
is
a
testament
to
this
and
can
serve
as
an
inspiration
to
all
of
us
that
no
matter
what
obstacles
we
face
dedication
and
practice
can
help
us
reach
our
goals
programs
that
bring
older
and
younger
students
together
in
the
same
school
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
education
and
collaboration
older
students
provide
insight
into
more
advanced
topics
and
can
serve
as
mentors
for
younger
students
as
they
learn
new
skills
younger
students
meanwhile
can
provide
enthusiasm
and
energy
as
well
as
fresh
perspectives
for
the
older
students
this
exchange
of
ideas
and
expertise
can
be
very
beneficial
when
planning
and
implementing
a
program
between
students
of
different
ages
it
is
important
to
consider
the
different
levels
of
responsibility
between
the
two
groups
for
example
older
students
may
need
to
assume
additional
leadership
roles
while
younger
students
may
need
additional
guidance
and
direction
this
can
be
beneficial
in
fostering
mutual
respect
and
building
skills
such
as
problem
solving
and
communication
in
scenarios
where
individuals
from
both
groups
are
actively
participating
and
engaging
it
can
be
especially
beneficial
this
can
include
activities
such
as
science
fairs
competitions
projects
and
more
the
opportunity
for
meaningful
interaction
can
open
many
doors
for
both
the
older
and
younger
students
in
the
program
of
course
there
may
be
some
drawbacks
to
consider
as
well
for
example
the
different
levels
of
maturity
and
experience
between
the
two
groups
can
sometimes
lead
to
frustrations
to
ensure
the
success
of
the
program
clear
communication
and
mutual
understanding
between
the
groups
is
key
with
effective
planning
and
implementation
these
programs
can
contribute
to
a
stimulating
and
collaborative
experience
for
everyone
involved
the
school
board
s
newly
implemented
decision
to
add
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
would
be
detrimental
to
the
overall
physical
and
mental
wellbeing
of
students
for
starters
i
would
have
to
sacrifice
time
that
i
need
for
sleep
in
order
to
meet
the
new
demands
of
this
extended
school
day
not
only
do
i
require
a
healthy
amount
of
sleep
to
keep
up
with
the
demands
of
my
current
curriculum
but
i
have
the
added
stress
of
my
extracurricular
activities
to
juggle
alongside
the
extended
school
day
would
leave
me
with
absolutely
no
time
to
pursue
any
hobbies
or
projects
outside
of
school
in
addition
due
to
the
excessive
amount
of
time
spent
in
school
each
day
i
would
not
be
able
to
effectively
dedicate
enough
resources
to
each
subject
in
consequence
of
this
the
overall
quality
of
learning
that
i
receive
would
be
drastically
reduced
hours
of
school
is
the
international
average
for
the
amount
of
time
required
by
students
to
fully
learn
the
material
in
an
effective
and
concise
fashion
with
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
added
to
the
day
students
would
become
fatigued
easily
thus
taking
time
away
from
learning
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
delve
deeper
into
the
curriculum
distance
learning
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
educational
option
for
high
school
students
in
recent
years
through
distance
learning
students
can
gain
access
to
quality
educational
programs
from
anywhere
in
the
world
students
can
attend
virtual
classes
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
cutting
out
the
need
for
a
long
commute
or
relocation
to
another
city
or
state
distance
learning
also
empowers
students
to
customize
their
academic
plans
to
fit
their
own
interests
and
needs
for
example
students
interested
in
pursuing
a
specific
academic
pathway
can
access
online
courses
or
programs
that
focus
on
their
desired
topic
of
study
additionally
because
students
attend
virtual
classes
they
can
access
coursework
on
their
own
timetable
allowing
students
to
progress
at
their
own
pace
can
be
especially
beneficial
for
students
with
special
needs
or
medical
issues
that
may
prevent
them
from
attending
in person
classes
in
many
ways
distance
learning
provides
high
school
students
with
unprecedented
access
to
educational
opportunities
phones
have
become
an
essential
part
of
modern
life
and
many
students
rely
on
them
for
communication
entertainment
and
productivity
allowing
students
to
have
access
to
their
cell
phones
while
at
school
could
be
a
beneficial
policy
for
both
students
and
teachers
alike
from
the
student
s
perspective
cell
phones
provide
an
invaluable
source
for
learning
through
the
use
of
educational
applications
and
online
research
resources
cell
phones
can
be
used
to
broaden
students
knowledge
and
supplement
their
school
education
students
can
use
their
cell
phones
to
access
other
helpful
tools
such
as
calculators
and
translation
services
which
will
enable
them
to
better
understand
and
engage
with
their
lessons
additionally
giving
students
access
to
their
cell
phones
allows
them
to
stay
connected
with
their
friends
and
family
this
sense
of
connectedness
will
likely
provide
students
with
a
sense
of
comfort
and
security
and
can
help
to
reduce
any
anxiety
or
stress
levels
that
they
may
experience
while
at
school
from
a
teacher
s
perspective
students
having
access
to
their
cell
phones
can
provide
a
number
of
benefits
for
example
when
an
emergency
or
urgent
situation
arises
teachers
can
easily
contact
students
parents
or
guardians
using
their
cell
phones
furthermore
allowing
students
to
have
access
to
their
cell
phones
also
provides
a
helpful
distraction
for
those
students
who
have
trouble
focusing
in
class
in
conclusion
allowing
students
to
have
access
to
their
cell
phones
while
at
school
could
be
a
beneficial
policy
for
both
students
and
teachers
alike
with
the
various
educational
resources
stress reducing
capabilities
and
contact
options
provided
by
cell
phones
it
is
clear
that
policy
one
should
be
implemented
in
the
school
system
taking
on
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
an
admirable
pursuit
however
there
are
potential
negatives
associated
with
this
decision
that
must
be
considered
emotionally
children
and
young
adults
may
face
feelings
of
loneliness
exhaustion
resentment
and
even
burnout
these
intensifying
feelings
can
interfere
with
their
ability
to
perform
well
in
their
chosen
career
and
can
also
lead
to
difficulty
maintaining
relationships
and
other
commitments
having
to
juggle
multiple
competing
responsibilities
can
be
mentally
taxing
and
lead
to
a
sense
of
confusion
and
stress
that
can
cause
children
and
young
adults
to
feel
helpless
in
their
career
path
in
some
cases
adjusting
to
their
role
may
come
at
the
cost
of
important
aspects
of
childhood
such
as
engaging
with
friends
and
family
playing
sports
and
finding
time
for
hobbies
with
this
in
mind
it
is
important
to
think
carefully
and
realistically
about
taking
on
a
career
before
making
a
serious
or
long term
commitment
my
father
worked
hard
his
entire
life
and
his
dedication
to
his
job
was
matched
by
his
dedication
to
his
family
one
of
his
greatest
traits
was
the
humility
he
showed
in
telling
the
stories
of
his
own
experiences
that
shaped
him
into
the
man
i
knew
and
loved
he
often
reminded
me
that
if
i
learned
from
my
mistakes
and
worked
hard
to
master
my
craft
i
would
be
successful
i
was
recently
struck
by
the
number
of
impressive
stories
i
heard
from
my
grandfather
who
is
now
in
his
late
he
taught
me
the
importance
of
perseverance
the
value
of
treating
people
respectfully
and
how
hard
one
has
to
work
to
be
successful
i
was
also
able
to
talk
to
many
other
elders
in
my
community
they
shared
stories
of
struggle
survival
and
how
they
pursued
their
dreams
in
spite
of
the
daily
hardships
through
their
stories
i
learned
lessons
about
resilience
faith
and
how
to
turn
hard
work
into
success
listening
to
the
stories
from
my
family
and
other
elders
in
my
community
gave
me
the
impetus
to
analyze
and
reflect
on
the
wisdom
found
in
their
experiences
i
am
now
better
equipped
to
understand
life
and
make
informed
decisions
along
the
way
in
most
cases
it
is
simply
naive
to
believe
that
a
problem
is
a
chance
for
you
to
do
your
best
problems
require
both
time
and
energy
to
solve
making
them
a
significant
challenge
to
conquer
as
such
it
is
not
always
easy
for
an
individual
to
perform
optimally
when
faced
with
a
problem
consider
the
example
of
someone
who
has
been
struggling
with
an
addiction
for
many
years
despite
the
many
challenges
and
hardships
that
have
been
faced
this
individual
has
failed
to
make
progress
in
overcoming
their
problem
this
situation
clearly
demonstrates
that
simply
labelling
a
problem
as
an
opportunity
to
do
one
s
best
is
not
an
effective
solution
some
individuals
acquire
a
bad
habit
of
repeating
the
same
mistakes
over
and
over
again
this
repetition
prevents
them
from
growing
and
developing
as
a
person
and
can
cause
them
to
be
stuck
in
a
stagnant
pattern
of
behavior
when
a
person
is
failing
to
learn
from
their
mistakes
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
they
could
adequately
address
a
new
problem
using
their
best
efforts
though
some
may
argue
that
facing
a
problem
is
beneficial
as
it
allows
one
to
be
proactive
and
seek
assistance
from
the
resources
needed
to
solve
the
problem
this
has
the
potential
to
come
at
a
cost
for
some
individuals
the
consequences
of
their
current
problems
may
be
too
great
for
them
to
handle
they
may
have
to
confront
the
difficult
consequences
of
the
problem
with
no
ability
to
perform
at
their
best
to
address
the
issue
therefore
it
is
evident
that
a
problem
is
a
chance
for
you
to
do
your
best
is
not
always
a
sound
philosophy
the
best
way
to
succeed
in
life
is
often
by
making
fewer
mistakes
rather
than
relying
on
the
chance
to
do
your
best
when
presented
with
a
problem
first
impressions
are
incredibly
important
in
the
formation
of
relationships
and
opinions
of
people
and
events
they
can
shape
the
way
we
view
the
people
places
and
cultures
around
us
throughout
my
life
i
have
both
experienced
and
seen
first
impressions
that
are
hard
to
overcome
for
example
i
remember
going
to
a
new
school
and
having
my
first
impressions
of
the
other
students
being
based
on
what
they
wore
the
things
they
said
and
their
general
attitude
towards
the
other
students
sadly
these
initial
often
inaccurate
impressions
would
remain
with
me
for
some
time
incidentally
this
is
backed
up
by
research
which
suggests
that
first
impressions
are
made
quickly
often
in
less
than
a
few
seconds
and
are
difficult
to
later
change
it
s
even
been
shown
that
first
impressions
are
made
primarily
using
visual
cues
such
as
clothing
hairstyles
body
language
and
facial
expressions
while
some
first
impressions
are
accurate
in
predicting
how
people
will
behave
many
times
they
are
not
which
is
why
it
s
so
important
to
be
aware
of
them
by
being
aware
of
first
impressions
we
can
make
sure
that
we
do
n t
unnecessarily
limit
our
relationships
and
interactions
with
other
people
based
on
these
first
impressions
it
s
also
important
to
remember
that
first
impressions
are
not
always
accurate
and
making
snap
judgments
about
someone
could
lead
to
misdirected
opinions
and
misunderstandings
of
the
person
in
question
in
essence
first
impressions
are
a
powerful
tool
that
can
shape
our
opinions
of
an
individual
or
situation
but
it
s
important
to
remember
that
these
first
impressions
can
be
wrong
the
idea
of
a
four day
work
week
with
ten
hour
days
is
gaining
traction
in
the
business
world
and
for
good
reason
many
studies
suggest
that
this
type
of
schedule
can
maximize
productivity
and
energy
levels
while
reducing
fatigue
and
increasing
employee
satisfaction
in
terms
of
energy
use
the
compact
time
frame
of
this
type
of
arrangement
means
that
less
energy
is
consumed
overall
in
addition
employees
often
report
feeling
more
motivated
and
refreshed
due
to
the
additional
day
off
this
can
increase
productivity
as
employees
have
more
time
to
rest
and
recharge
while
the
five
day
work
week
is
the
more
traditional
option
the
four
day
work
week
with
ten
hour
days
has
the
potential
to
bring
benefits
to
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
be
incredibly
useful
for
making
sound
decisions
while
also
being
susceptible
to
bias
and
personal
preference
on
the
other
hand
deciding
for
oneself
without
outside
guidance
allows
for
full
autonomy
and
the
opportunity
to
make
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
there
are
many
stories
of
people
who
have
achieved
success
by
following
their
own
decisions
regardless
of
what
society
or
authority
figures
told
them
to
do
it
is
important
to
learn
from
one
s
own
mistakes
so
that
they
may
continue
to
improve
and
grow
without
ever
making
your
own
decisions
and
taking
your
own
risks
you
miss
out
on
invaluable
learning
experiences
the
difference
between
making
mistakes
and
learning
from
them
is
understanding
why
the
mistake
was
made
and
recognizing
why
it
should
not
be
made
again
failing
to
recognize
why
the
mistake
was
made
means
the
mistake
could
be
made
again
and
true
growth
is
not
achieved
or
is
an
educational
program
designed
to
provide
a
framework
of
support
for
students
who
have
the
desire
to
attend
a
four year
college
or
university
this
courses
helps
set
goals
develop
and
hone
skills
and
cultivate
success
and
offers
students
the
opportunity
to
learn
essential
life
skills
that
will
help
them
steadfastly
pursue
a
post secondary
education
with
students
learn
valuable
skills
such
as
time
management
goal
setting
team building
organization
and
presentation
preparation
all
of
these
skills
are
necessary
for
life
after
school
and
offer
the
students
a
chance
to
truly
develop
and
learn
more
about
themselves
another
important
aspect
of
is
the
relationships
and
connections
made
students
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
people
from
different
backgrounds
and
perspectives
providing
a
more
holistic
perspective
on
their
studies
above
all
is
enjoyable
because
of
its
supportive
atmosphere
with
students
do
not
feel
pressured
to
achieve
their
goals
and
can
take
any
necessary
challenges
at
their
own
pace
this
is
why
remains
such
a
worthwhile
and
rewarding
activity
not
only
does
it
provide
students
with
the
tools
necessary
to
succeed
but
it
also
encourages

positively
and
reach
their
maximum
potential
offering
classes
online
or
via
video
conferencing
to
students
who
live
far
away
can
provide
numerous
advantages
for
both
the
students
and
the
school
for
students
there
is
no
longer
the
need
to
drive
or
take
public
transport
to
the
school
which
can
help
save
them
time
money
and
energy
this
can
open
up
opportunities
for
students
who
do
not
have
the
resources
to
travel
to
classes
while
also
creating
a
comfortable
learning
environment
for
those
who
feel
anxious
or
overwhelmed
in
a
traditional
classroom
the
remote
learning
options
can
also
extend
beyond
physical
boundaries
allowing
students
to
take
classes
they
may
not
have
access
to
locally
by
providing
online
or
virtual
classes
students
have
access
to
additional
educational
opportunities
that
can
help
prepare
them
for
the
future
the
availability
of
these
classes
can
also
provide
schools
with
the
potential
to
reach
and
engage
with
a
broader
range
of
students
by
offering
the
opportunity
to
take
classes
online
or
via
video
conferencing
the
school
has
the
potential
to
attract
more
participants
increasing
their
student
body
size
while
also
having
a
positive
impact
on
learning
famously
said
is
more
important
than
knowledge
is
limited
imagination
encircles
the
world
this
statement
speaks
to
the
power
of
imagination
and
its
ability
to
stretch
beyond
circumstances
and
possibilitites
of
the
physical
may
guide
us
through
life
but
imagination
can
help
us
envision
a
better
world
for
instance
the
technological
advances
of
the
century
would
have
been
impossible
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
imaginations
of
inventors
like
and
without
their
vision
we
wouldn
t
have
access
to
lightning fast
communication
and
other
tools
that
rely
upon
the
power
of
imagination
imagination
can
also
be
credited
with
our
ability
to
progress
culturally
and
spiritually
when
we
embrace
imagination
it
helps
us
envision
paths
to
personal
growth
and
transformation
it
can
constantly
inspire
us
to
think
bigger
and
better
to
uncover
new
insights
and
explore
our
own
potential
in
many
respects
imagination
is
the
tool
with
which
we
build
the
future
it
is
more
important
than
knowledge
because
it
enables
us
to
find
creative
solutions
to
our
problems
build
upon
our
wins
and
become
wiser
as
a
collective
without
it
our
ambition
to
learn
and
grow
our
potential
would
be
limited
ultimately
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
because
it
is
the
spark
that
triggers
creativity
discovery
and
progress
it
allows
us
to
reshape
our
reality
and
pursue
a
better
tomorrow
through
our
imagination
we
can
rewrite
the
rules
and
design
the
future
people
feel
a
special
connection
to
the
outdoors
that
ca
n t
be
found
anywhere
else
visiting
a
park
is
a
chance
to
explore
the
beauty
of
nature
in
an
accessible
and
affordable
way
in
a
park
one
can
find
peace
and
relaxation
away
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
everyday
life
there
are
many
activities
available
in
the
park
from
taking
a
leisurely
stroll
to
playing
sports
to
going
on
a
picnic
parks
are
also
family friendly
and
provide
the
perfect
environment
for
children
to
learn
and
grow
while
having
fun
additionally
they
often
contain
plenty
of
wildlife
and
natural
scenery
which
can
help
people
to
appreciate
and
understand
the
world
around
them
furthermore
for
those
who
live
in
urban
environments
like
cities
a
park
is
often
the
closest
place
to
go
and
experience
the
beauty
of
nature
all
of
these
reasons
make
going
to
the
park
a
wonderful
and
rewarding
experience
it
is
important
to
consider
alternative
extracurricular
activities
to
the
more
commonly
known
activities
such
as
sports
yearbook
making
and
student
counciling
activities
such
as
art
music
cooking
chess
club
drama
computer
studies
science
math
reading
and
writing
have
many
benefits
such
as
fostering
creativity
teaching
valuable
skills
and
expanding
a
student
s
knowledge
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
drawbacks
as
well
such
as
potential
distractions
or
lack
of
recognition
it
is
also
important
to
understand
the
opinions
of
students
who
do
not
wish
to
participate
in
any
of
the
extracurricular
activities
therefore
a
recommendation
for
the
principal
should
include
a
variety
of
extracurricular
activities
including
activities
that
can
allow
for
creativity
such
as
art
and
music
furthermore
there
should
be
activities
that
provide
an
opportunity
for
students
to
learn
valuable
skills
such
as
computer
studies
and
chess
club
some
extracurricular
activities
should
allow
for
knowledge
expansion
such
as
science
and
math
in
this
way
students
of
all
interests
and
abilities
can
find
an
extracurricular
activity
that
fits
their
needs
studies
have
shown
that
using
examples
in
communication
can
be
an
effective
tool
to
influence
people
s
behavior
research
from
a
study
by
and
showed
that
consumers
were
more
likely
to
sign
up
for
energy
conservation
programs
after
seeing
an
example
of
someone
similar
to
them
who
had
already
adopted
such
a
program
this
illustrates
the
power
of
social
proof
and
how
the
actions
of
certain
individuals
can
have
a
ripple
effect
and
motivate
someone
else
to
follow
an
example
other
studies
have
also
shown
that
simply
providing
an
example
of
the
desired
behavior
can
be
effective
in
influencing
people
s
action
it
is
important
however
to
make
sure
that
the
example
is
relatable
and
relevant
in
order
to
maximize
its
impact
graduating

can
be
a
great
opportunity

must
plan
ahead

they
decide
that
they
are
interested
in
graduating

they
can
begin
researching
the
options
that
their
school
has
available
they
may
need
to
look
into
accelerated
courses
available
dual enrollment
programs
or
other
options
that
their
school
can
offer
it
is
important
to
take
the
time
to
ask
questions
and
research
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
each
option
before
selecting
one
doing
so
can
help
make
sure
students
are
prepared
for
the
increased

and
complexity
that
comes
with
taking
accelerated
classes
for
students
who
are

can
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
reduce
their
high
school

and
get
a
head

on
their
educational
pursuits
the
advent
of
online
school
has
ushered
in
a
new
era
for
young
scholars
the
potential
benefits
of
online
school
are
manifold it
can
make
higher
education
more
accessible
to
students
with
disabilities
or
illnesses
provide
a
more
flexible
learning
environment
for
students
and
open
up
opportunities
for
them
to
gain
employment
on
the
other
hand
some
drawbacks
of
online
school
should
not
be
overlooked
the
prevalence
of
technology
in
every
home
is
not
a
given
thus
access
to
computers
and
the
internet
can
be
quite
a
challenge
for
many
students
particularly
in
some
socio economic
communities
nevertheless
the
potential
for
online
school
to
help
both
those
with
disabilities
or
illness
and
the
economy
should
not
be
discounted
with
the
right
technological
infrastructure
and
support
online
school
could
become
an
option
for
all
school
districts
allowing
students
to
access
educational
opportunities
that
would
otherwise
be
unavailable
though
there
is
no
one
activity
that
can
provide
every
benefit
the
outdoors
offer
a
variety
of
activities
that
can
be
tailored
to
suit
any
individual
s
lifestyle
and
health
goals
activities
such
as
biking
running
swimming
and
hiking
have
numerous
benefits
that
range
from
lower
stress
levels
to
providing
a
full body
workout
even
something
as
simple
as
taking
a
walk
or
going
for
a
picnic
can
help
improve
mental
health
and
foster
a
sense
of
connection
with
nature
additionally
spending
time
outdoors
provides
opportunities
to
connect
with
family
friends
and
potential
new
acquaintances
setting
a
plan
for
people
to
get
fit
while
enjoying
the

have
to
be

creating
opportunities
to
help
those
in
need
such
as
donating

gear
or
participating
in
a

multi faceted
experience
was
the
third
president
of
the
states
and
one
of
the
founding
fathers
of
the
nation
he
led
a
remarkable
life
full
of
impressive
accomplishments
that
exemplify
the
principle
of
doing
work
always
the
founding
of
the
of
for
example
was
a
testament
to
the
less
popular
slogan
never
tire
of
doing
work
s
unwavering
diligence
shaped
the
future
of
education
in
the
states
and
set
an
example
for
generations
to
come
this
idea
of
doing
work
always
has
benefitted
many
people
throughout
history
from
famous
politicians
to
humble
citizens
throughout
s
lifetime
the
hardworking
people
around
him
believed
that
working
hard
was
the
surest
path
to
achieving
success
similarly
hard
work
has
played
an
important
role
in
inspiring
the
success
of
countless
individuals
from
century
poet
to
modern day
entrepreneur
revealing
the
power
of
doing
work
always
in
contrast
the
consequences
of
not
doing
work
always
can
have
negative
effects
on
individuals
and
society
on
the
individual
level
a
lack
of
hard
work
can
prevent
us
from
achieving
our
goals
and
lead
to
stagnation
and
dissatisfaction
with
life
on
the
society
level
it
can
lead
to
lack
of
innovation
and
progress
which
can
be
especially
problematic
in
a
rapidly evolving
world
personally
i
have
seen
the
impact
of
doing
work
always
firsthand
it
has
been
the
cornerstone
of
my
education
and
career
continually
pushing
me
to
reach
higher
and
try
harder
i
have
experienced
countless
successes
all
highlighting
the
power
of
doing
work
always
and
the
amazing
things
that
can
be
accomplished
through
hard
work
and
dedication
i
recently
had
a
personal
experience
that
once
again
reminded
me
of
the
power
of
a
positive
attitude
to
lead
us
to
success
i
was
completely
overwhelmed
by
a
seemingly
insurmountable
challenge
that
had
been
set
before
me
to
build
a
complex
website
in
a
very
short
amount
of
time
i
felt
defeated
before
even
beginning
and
was
convinced
the
project
was
doomed
but
then
something
shifted
and
i
decided
to
take
a
different
approach
i
remembered
a
quote
that
said
positive
attitude
can
create
mountains
out
of
molehills
i
decided
to
challenge
myself
to
have
a
positive
attitude
during
the
entire
process
i
made
myself
smile
even
when
things
were
hardest
and
kept
positive
affirmations
in
my
mind
throughout
as
a
result
i
was
able
to
complete
the
project
not
only
on
time
but
in
half
the
amount
of
time
i
originally
anticipated
this
was
a
life changing
moment
for
me
i
realized
the
value
in
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
no
matter
how
difficult
the
situation
from
that
day
forward
i
decided
to
always
keep
a
positive
attitude
in
life
no
matter
what
i
am
doing
not
only
does
it
help
me
stay
motivated
and
feel
better
but
i
have
seen
first hand
how
it
can
contribute
to
my
success
through
experience
i
now
know
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
often
times
make
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
it
has
the
power
to
not
only
reduce
the
difficulty
of
the
task
at
hand
but
also
to
act
as
a
beacon
of
hope
that
illuminates
a
path
for
achieving
our
goals
a
positive
attitude
plays
a
crucial
role
in
achieving
success
in
life
it
can
increase
the
chances
of
making
a
good
impression
in
job
interviews
and
can
also
help
demonstrate
the
positive
traits
that
come
from
a
person
s
upbringing
and
education
furthermore
having
a
good
attitude
can
be
directly
linked
to
better
academic
achievement
although
attitudes
can
be
shaped
by
environment
and
experiences
they
are
also
internalized
and
focused
upon
by
the
individual
consequently
attitudes
can
not
be
completely
avoided
however
the
benefits
of
having
a
positive
attitude
are
far
greater
than
those
of
a
bad
attitude
those
who
choose
to
have
a
good
attitude
are
more
likely
to
reach
their
goals
and
attain
success
in
life
as
students
grow
up
they
are
encouraged
to
plan
for
their
future
and
this
often
starts
with
considering
a
career
choice
at
a
young
age
deciding
on
a
career
path
can
be
an
important
and
empowering
process
and
there
are
several
benefits
to
this
it
can
lead
to
more
purposeful
learning
when
young
students
are
aware
of
the
relevance
of
what
they
are
learning
in
relation
to
their
chosen
career
also
if
students
know
of
a
career
they
would
like
to
pursue
they
are
likely
to
be
more
engaged
in
planning
for
their
future
and
have
a
heightened
awareness
of
the
value
of
their
school
experience
in
this
regard
on
the
other
hand
making
decisions
about
their
future
at
a
young
age
can
be
overwhelming
for
students
as
they
are
not
yet
fully
aware
of
the
range
of
possibilities
available
to
them
decisions
made
at
this
time
in
life
can
too
easily
become
rigid
and
inflexible
furthermore
since
young
students
may
not
have
experienced
a
breadth
of
different
options
their
decisions
may
be
rooted
more
in
a
romanticized
viewing
of
a
potential
job
than
in
reality
in
summary
although
there
are
benefits
to
young
students
starting
to
think
about
their
future
career
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
decisions
made
at
such
a
young
age
do
not
limit
the
student
s
options
and
remain
open
to
change
and
new
possibilities
one
s
character
traits
are
often
strongly
influenced
by
the
people
we
communicate
with
and
the
environment
in
which
we
live
for
example
growing
up
i
had
a
close
friend
who
was
very
outgoing
and
adventurous
spending
time
with
them
often
pushed
me
out
of
my
comfort
zone
and
encouraged
me
to
take
on
new
challenges
over
time
i
developed
a
strong
sense
of
confidence
and
an
inclination
towards
taking
risks
traits
that
i
would
not
have
had
access
to
without
my
friend
s
influence
similarly
if
a
person
is
raised
in
an
environment
where
creativity
is
actively
encouraged
and
supported
they
are
more
likely
to
be
inventive
and
curious
throughout
their
life
to
illustrate
this
point
one
of
my
relatives
grew
up
in
an
environment
where
she
was
surrounded
by
art
music
and
books
at
a
young
age
her
parents
exposed
her
to
various
forms
of
creative
expression
and
provided
her
with
the
necessary
resources
and
tools
to
be
creative
as
a
result
she
grew
up
to
be
very
artistic
and
proficient
in
multiple
instruments
this
would
have
not
been
the
case
had
she
not
been
exposed
to
the
various
forms
of
art
and
creativity
in
her
childhood
overall
it
is
clear
that
one
s
character
traits
are
often
heavily
influenced
and
formed
by
the
people
we
communicate
with
and
the
environments
in
which
we
live
through
careful
consideration
and
exploration
of
these
external
factors
a
person
can
cultivate
an
abundance
of
positive
traits
and
become
their
best
possible
self
people
often
find
that
their
first
impressions
or
memories
of
a
significant
event
can
profoundly
shape
their
outlook
on
life
and
how
they
conduct
themselves
in
the
future
for
me
that
event
was
my
first
day
of
school
as
a
five year old
i
was
incredibly
nervous
but
when
i
got
to
the
school
i
saw
so
many
smiling
faces
and
heard
the
warm
greetings
of
the
faculty
which
put
me
immediately
at
ease
and
gave
me
the
confidence
to
face
the
school
year
ahead
my
first
day
of
school
left
me
with
a
lasting
impression
that
has
stayed
with
me
over
the
years
every
day
i
strive
to
bring
the
positive
energy
that
i
felt
on
that
first
day
of
school
with
me
reminding
myself
that
people
are
generally
good
despite
the
occasional
setbacks
and
negative
experiences
we
all
face
this
outlook
on
life
has
been
instrumental
in
helping
me
persevere
through
difficult
times
and
make
decisions
that
i
m
proud
of
that
day
not
gone
as
well
as
it
did
i
m
certain
that
my
outlook
on
the
world
would
have
been
far
different
it
s
amazing
how
much
of
an
impact
one
event
can
have
if
the
same
situation
presented
itself
again
i
know
that
i
d
be
just
as
thankful
for
the
chance
to
be
surrounded
by
the
positive
energy
of
others
a
few
years
ago
i
made
a
mistake
and
was
charged
with
a
minor
crime
i
quickly
learned
that
even
small
offences
can
lead
to
big
consequences
and
have
lasting
effects
i
was
sentenced
to
hours
of
community
service
although
it
was
quite
a
long
time
to
commit
i
soon
realized
the
value
of
giving
back
to
the
community
i
met
people
that
i
would
never
have
been
connected
to
had
i
not
made
that
mistake
i
realized
how
much
i
enjoyed
the
connection
of
helping
others
whenever
i
saw
the
impact
that
those
hours
had
on
the
people
we
were
helping
it
re affirmed
that
my
time
was
making
a
difference
i
grabbed
every
opportunity
to
volunteer
to
make
sure
i
could
make
the
most
out
of
my
mandated
requirement
i
was
able
to
recognize
the
value
of
service
and
plans
to
stay
involved
with
various
volunteer
organizations
my
experience
of
community
service
has
been
an
eye opening
one
i
have
learned
valuable
lessons
about
why
laws
are
in
place
and
the
importance
of
continuing
to
do
the
right
thing
i
have
gained
an
appreciation
for
the
communities
i
interact
with
and
the
need
to
be
of
service
even
if
it
comes
from
an
unfortunate
experience
i
know
now
that
striving
to
give
back
is
a
consequence
that
i
am
more
than
willing
to
take
when
i
look
at
failure
the
first
thing
i
think
about
is
how
much
i
have
learned
from
personal
experiences
one
of
the
most
influential
experiences
i
have
had
with
failure
was
when
i
missed
a
goal
i
had
set
for
myself
when
i
was
younger
although
it
was
initially
hard
to
grapple
with
i
eventually
realized
that
the
experience
had
helped
me
to
grow
as
a
person
by
failing
and
coming
to
terms
with
the
failure
i
was
able
to
develop
a
better
understanding
of
how
to
work
smarter
and
plan
for
things
better
in
the
future
overall
failure
is
not
something
most
people
desire
yet
it
can
be
a
productive
process
it
can
instill
a
deeper
level
of
motivation
leading
to
increased
productivity
and
resilience
failure
can
also
be
seen
as
a
learning
experience
and
spark
self reflection
as
it
gives
people
an
opportunity
to
reassess
their
current
strategies
and
formulate
a
better
plan
or
approach
more
importantly
failure
can
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
catalysts
for
success
it
can
be
a
pivot
point
where
people
decide
to
stand
up
take
action
and
strive
towards
their
goals
with
increased
ambition
and
determination
in
conclusion
i
believe
that
failure
can
have
tremendous
benefits
for
humans
in
the
long
run
while
it
may
initially
seem
daunting
the
lessons
and
knowledge
provided
from
failure
should
be
looked
at
as
an
opportunity
to
grow
failure
can
help
sharpen
our
skills
belief
in
ourselves
and
provide
an
authentic
platform
to
persevere
towards
success
in
my
opinion
students
with
a
average
or
lower
should
absolutely
be
allowed
to
participate
in
sports
and
other
activities
at
school
it
is
important
to
remember
that
these
students
are
likely
doing
their
best
to
succeed
in
their
classes
and
should
not
be
excluded
from
other
activities
that
will
help
them
grow
and
develop
in
a
positive
way
for
many
students
taking
part
in
extracurricular
activities
can
help
them
to
feel
connected
with
their
peers
and
provide
an
outlet
from
the
stress
of
academics
it
should
also
be
noted
that
there
will
be
times
when
students
who
are
trying
their
best
may
still
be
having
difficulty
meeting
the
average
requirement
therefore
it
is
wrong
to
completely
exclude
them
from
experiencing
activities
outside
of
the
classroom
all
students
should
have
access
to
sports
and
activities
that
will
benefit
them
regardless
of
their
academic
performance
when
it
comes
to
choosing
a
career
while
still
in
high
school
there
are
definite
risks
that
come
with
the
process
most
notably
young
students
can
easily
become
overwhelmed
as
they
might
not
yet
have
the
life
experience
or
knowledge
to
make
a
wise
and
informed
decision
about
their
future
what
s
more
they
might
not
know
what
they
want
to
do
in
life
yet
they
are
asked
to
decide
this
can
create
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
stress
societal
pressure
can
also
play
a
role
in
decisions
made
at
this
age
as
students
may
feel
pressured
to
begin
their
career
earlier
than
necessary
or
to
make
choices
that
may
not
be
in
their
best
interest
this
pressure
extends
far
into
our
society
with
both
parents
and
peers
pushing
to
make
a
smart
decision
about
the
future
in
summary
while
there
can
be
great
rewards
to
beginning
a
career
while
in
high
school
it
can
also
be
detrimental
and
potentially
overwhelming
it
is
important
for
young
students
to
take
into
consideration
their
own
emotions
and
feelings
before
deciding
whether
they
want
to
take
on
a
career
while
still
in
high
school
the
rapid
growth
of
technology
throughout
the
world
has
led
to
an
unprecedented
level
of
convenience
for
many
people
unfortunately
this
growth
has
also
had
its
drawbacks
one
of
the
greatest
losses
of
this
age
is
the
diminishing
level
of
personal
contact
between
individuals
although
technology
may
help
reduce
physical
distance
between
family
friends
and
colleagues
by
allowing
us
to
chat
or
video
call
there
is
still
a
disconnect
between
personal
conversations
and
digital
communication
this
disconnect
can
have
several
negative
effects
on
our
relationships
for
instance
it
can
limit
our
ability
to
have
meaningful
conversations
make
us
more
prone
to
miscommunications
and
make
us
more
likely
to
become
disconnected
from
people
who
do
n t
use
the
same
technology
thankfully
there
are
proactive
ways
to
combat
the
negative
effects
of
technology
s
limitations
on
human
contact
making
an
effort
to
reach
out
to
others
in
person
can
be
a
great
way
to
strengthen
relationships
by
making
the
social
effort
to
schedule
an
in person
meetup
or
outing
or
even
just
a
quick
phone
call
we
can
bridge
the
digital
gap
and
nourish
our
relationships
in
a
much
more
meaningful
way
than
a
text
or
email
additionally
participating
in
outdoor
activities
is
another
great
way
to
engage
in
face to face
conversations
and
build
stronger
relationships
taking
a
day
or
even
just
an
hour
away
from
technology
can
encourage
more
meaningful
conversations
strengthen
relationships
and
create
lasting
memories
with
the
people
who
mean
the
most
to
us
in
conclusion
the
rise
of
technology
has
undoubtedly
had
both
negative
and
positive
effects
by
making
an
effort
to
limit
our
digital
dependence
we
can
foster
stronger
connections
with
family
friends
and
colleagues
in
a
more
meaningful
way
taking
the
time
to
engage
in
face to face
conversations
can
strengthen
our
relationships
and
create
memories
that
will
last

lifetime

bring
something
unique

virtually
limitless
as
computer
science
and
engineering
become
more
widespread
computers
will

ever
more
powerful
this
will
unlock
many
potential
applications
with
far
reaching
implications
for

advanced
medical
diagnostics
and
treatments
smart
homes
that
monitor
energy
usage
for
cost
and
convenience
and
more
personalized
learning
experiences
tailored
to
individual
students
in
conclusion
technology
has
had
a
very
positive
impact
on
people
s
lives
particularly
in
education
it
has
allowed
for
more
personalized
instruction
greater
access
to
materials
and
resources
and
opened
up
entirely
new
ways
for
collaboration
among
students
with
advances
in
technology
across
all
areas
the
future
promises
to
be
even
more
exciting
throughout
history
many
successful
artists
have
gained
perspective
and
wisdom
from
the
criticism
they
have
received
notable
figures
such
as
and
learnt
from
constructive
criticism
on
their
works
despite
not
seeing
the
success
they
eventually
did
until
after
their
deaths
in
the
educational
field
criticism
is
just
as
important
as
praise
when
helping
students
reach
their
potential
receiving
criticism
is
an
essential
part
of
building
resilience
and
establishing
a
growth
mindset
in
learning
students
should
be
encouraged
to
challenge
their
understanding
of
topics
and
not
be
afraid
of
making
mistakes
you
can
not
learn
without
taking
the
risk
of
making
mistakes
and
potentially
receiving
criticism
but
this
should
not
be
seen
as
a
negative
thing
by
offering
students
constructive
criticism
teachers
can
create
an
environment
where
it
is
encouraged
to
ask
questions
and
take
risks
in
learning
students
should
also
understand
that
criticism
can
be
more
than
just
the
negative
aspect
that
it
is
often
seen
as
it
can
also
be
an
invaluable
source
of
feedback
that
can
expose
them
to
new
ideas
and
concepts
analyzing
criticism
can
help
students
to
learn
and
to
understand
concepts
from
a
different
perspective
with
this
understanding
students
can
acquire
the
skills
of
resilience
and
problem solving
overall
the
role
of
criticism
as
a
tool
of
learning
is
essential
and
its
importance
should
be
emphasized
in
the
educational
field
while
positive
reinforcement
plays
an
important
role
constructive
criticism
helps
bring
a
complete
educational
picture
and
in
some
cases
foster
resilience
and
problem solving
skills
in
students
respect
is
an
important
value
that
should
be
shared
by
all
people
regardless
of
age
country
or
religion
respect
for
others
should
be
at
the
core
of
our
interactions
and
is
necessary
for
success
in
life
not
only
will
treating
others
with
respect
and
kindness
help
to
create
harmony
but
it
can
also
lead
to
beneficial
outcomes
as
well
when
we
are
in
a
bad
mood
or
feeling
stressed
it
can
be
easy
to
forget
about
other
people
s
feelings
and
take
out
our
frustrations
on
them
however
this
could
have
a
negative
effect
on
our
relationships
causing
more
tension
and
anger
it
s
important
to
remember
that
respect
and
kindness
go
a
long
way
even
when
you
do
n t
feel
like
it
when
we
show
respect
and
consideration
for
those
around
us
it
can
lead
to
good
outcomes
people
will
be
more
likely
to
help
us
out
and
return
the
favour
when
we
treat
them
well
this
could
mean
better
relationships
with
friends
and
family
improved
career
opportunities
and
increased
respect
from
those
around
us
in
summary
treating
people
with
respect
regardless
of
age
country
or
religion
is
essential
for
life
success
it
is
important
to
consider
someone
s
feelings
even
when
we
are
not
in
a
good
mood
the
attitude
we
have
towards
others
can
have
both
beneficial
and
negative
outcomes
so
it
is
best
to
be
respectful
and
kind
studies
are
showing
that
a
four day
work
week
with
ten hour
days
has
a
number
of
benefits
for
both
students
and
teachers
for
students
having
the
extra
day
of
rest
can
provide
them
with
more
time
to
relax
mentally
prepare
for
their
future
and
more
time
to
study
in
order
to
pass
classes
teachers
also
need
more
time
away
from
school
in
order
to
have
time
with
their
families
or
to
provide
extra
mentorship
to
their
students
outside
of
school
it
has
been
shown
that
this
type
of
schedule
can
also
reduce
stress
for
students
and
teachers
as
well
as
providing
time
for
both
sides
to
engage
in
other
activities
moreover
students
and
teachers
can
benefit
from
the
three day
weekend
by
being
able
to
spend
more
quality
time
with
family
and
friends
and
by
having
more
time
for
leisure
and
other
activities
to
renew
energy
and
stay
productive
reading
books
helps
to
develop
our
brains
in
several
ways
studies
have
found
that
different
genres
of
books
can
help
with
different
areas
of
cognitive
development
for
instance
fiction
has
been
linked
to
improved
empathy
while
non fiction
can
expand
our
knowledge
base
and
critical
thinking
skills
participating
in
a
book
club
can
further
increase
these
benefits
by
providing
a
community
for
discussion
and
diversifying
our
reading
list
personally
i
view
reading
as
a
way
to
escape
and
open
up
my
world
to
new
ideas
and
perspectives
i
especially
love
to
curl
up
with
a
good
book
on
a
rainy
day
or
when
i
m
feeling
overwhelmed
it
helps
me
relax
and
refocus
my
thoughts
working
in
a
group
can
be
more
advantageous
than
working
alone
in
many
ways
by
collaborating
together
group
members
can
share
ideas
thoughts
and
resources
to
create
more
comprehensive
and
creative
solutions
that
may
be
less
achievable
individually
working
in
a
group
can
also
include
bouncing
ideas
off
one
another
so
members
can
identify
any
potential
issues
and
provide
helpful
feedback
and
direction
group
members
are
often
more
motivated
and
energized
to
work
together
making
the
task
more
enjoyable
than
working
alone
lastly
shared
accountability
ensures
that
tasks
are
completed
in
a
timely
and
effective
manner
leading
to
better
results
than
what
could
be
achieved
alone
the
four day
school
week
has
grown
in
popularity
as
an
alternative
to
the
typical
five
day
school
week
but
what
are
the
pros
and
cons
of
this
new
system
research
shows
a
potential
for
savings
in
energy
and
resources
due
to
greater
flexibility
in
managing
the
school
calendar
and
the
ability
to
reduce
operational
costs
but
there
are
also
potential
drawbacks
to
consider
students
may
find
it
difficult
to
adjust
to
an
extended
school
day
teachers
may
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
longer
teaching
load
and
the
quality
of
education
could
be
adversely
impacted
due
to
the
lack
of
a
traditional
five day
week
further
research
into
the
effectiveness
of
the
four day
school
week
is
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
system
is
a
viable
alternative
to
the
traditional
five day
school
week
several
school
systems
have
implemented
this
new
system
with
both
success
and
failure
for
example
in
the
school
system
students
and
staff
reported
greater
job
satisfaction
and
improved
attendance
conversely
in
the
four day
school
week
had
a
significant
negative
impact
on
student
performance
and
academic
achievement
when
compared
to
the
traditional
five day
school
week
the
four day
week
appears
to
have
both
environmental
and
economic
benefits
however
caution
must
be
taken
to
ensure
that
the
quality
of
education
is
not
sacrificed
it
is
important
to
consider
the
effect
that
the
longer
school
day
will
have
on
students
and
teachers
alike
and
to
ensure
that
the
resources
are
available
to
maintain
an
adequate
learning
environment
and
to
accommodate
the
longer
school
days
ultimately
only
when
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
are
considered
in
depth
can
a
conclusion
be
drawn
as
to
whether
or
not
implementing
a
four day
school
week
for
conserving
energy
and
resources
is
a
viable
option
praising
students
is
an
important
part
of
building
self esteem
is
a
child
s
belief
in
their
ability
to
succeed
and
meet
goals
it
helps
to
ensure
that
they
face
challenges
with
a
positive
attitude
praise
can
create
a
positive
environment
and
teach
children
that
it
is
alright
to
take
risks
and
challenge
themselves
even
if
there
may
be
some
failures
along
the
way
when
praising
students
it
is
important
to
be
specific
rather
than
general
statements
like
good
job
focus
on
the
process
a
child
utilized
to
get
good
results
for
example
praise
them
for
their
hard
work
and
determination
to
practice
and
master
a
skill
praising
effort
rather
than
results
can
make
children
feel
confident
in
trying
out
new
tasks
without
worrying
about
the
outcome
another
important
thing
to
remember
when
praising
students
is
to
be
genuine
can
detect
when
someone
is
insincere
and
when
they
do
it
can
have
the
opposite
effect
on
their
self esteem
praise
will
create
more
positive
reactions
in
children
and
will
motivate
them
to
keep
trying
and
doing
their
best
overall
praising
students
is
an
essential
tool
for
helping
to
build
self esteem
it
helps
children
to
understand
that
trying
and
failing
is
a
part
of
life
and
that
success
may
not
come
immediately
but
with
effort
and
determination
it
can
be
achieved
s
statement
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
is
a
powerful
idea
that
can
be
applied
in
myriad
contexts
it
speaks
to
the
idea
that
being
true
to
one
s
self
is
a
valuable
and
underrated
task
life
there
will
be
people
and
situations
that
try
to
change
who
you
are
and
there
is
great
strength
in
resisting
and
staying
true
to
oneself
the
first
step
to
being
oneself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
to
recognize
and
accept
one
s
own
uniqueness
it
is
essential
to
understand
that
everyone
is
different
no
one
is
exactly
like
anyone
else
and
no
single
individual
possesses
all
the
necessary
skills
and
qualities
in
one
package
and
embracing
this
individuality
can
be
both
liberating
and
empowering
the
next
step
is
to
devote
time
and
energy
to
focusing
on
one
s
own
needs
and
goals
rather
than
comparing
oneself
to
others
and
attempting
to
constantly
change
oneself
to
keep
up
with
their
successes
is
a
pathway
to
unhappiness
because
it
distracts
one
s
focus
away
from
oneself
instead
taking
the
time
to
set
goals
and
develop
long term
strategies
to
achieving
them
regardless
of
external
pressures
and
demands
is
the
most
effective
way
to
be
oneself
in
a
world
that
is
trying
to
make
you
something
else
by
having
an
attainable
plan
to
reach
one
s
goals
one
is
less
likely
to
be
pulled
away
from
achieving
them
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
s
statement
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
is
indeed
true
taking
the
time
and
effort
to
recognize
and
accept
one
s
uniqueness
as
well
as
focusing
on
one
s
own
needs
and
goals
are
two
effective
steps
in
achieving
this
greatest
accomplishment
as
a
student
i
believe
that
requiring
students
to
maintain
a
grade
average
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
is
a
wise
decision
in
my
opinion
students
should
understand
that
there
is
a
direct
correlation
between
their
academic
performance
and
their
ability
to
participate
in
activities
outside
of
the
classroom
this
gracefully
encourages
students
to
strive
to
do
their
best
in
school
and
understand
the
importance
of
working
hard
to
achieve
their
goals
furthermore
this
requirement
allows
the
school
to
ensure
that
students
can
handle
the
extra
workload
associated
with
extracurricular
activities
while
still
balancing
their
academic
responsibilities
ensuring
this
balance
will
lead
to
increased
student
success
as
well
as
fewer
overwhelmed
and
stressed
students
it
is
crucial
that
students
take
the
time
to
invest
in
their
education
and
understand
the
importance
of
good
grades
and
this
policy
encourages
them
to
make
the
effort
overall
i
believe
this
policy
to
require
a
grade
average
is
a
beneficial
change
for
the
school
activities
it
raises
the
educational
standards
for
our
school
while
motivating
and
inspiring
students
to
make
the
most
of
their
education
distance
learning
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
recent
years
with
more
and
more
schools
offering
online
or
virtual
classes
as
such
it
can
be
a
great
option
for
students
looking
to
get
a
quality
education
while
balancing
other
commitments
and
interests
on
the
other
hand
some
may
be
apprehensive
about
this
type
of
learning
as
traditional
schooling
provides
invaluable
benefits
such
as
personal
interaction
with
teachers
and
classmates
individualized
instruction
and
consistent
feedback
for
those
considering
taking
advantage
of
distance
learning
opportunities
i
believe
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
consider
on
the
plus
side
distance
learning
allows
students
to
learn
in
their
own
environment
where
they
can
better
control
their
schedule
and
other
distractions
additionally
many
online
courses
are
asynchronous
meaning
students
can
access
lectures
and
submit
assignments
on
their
own
time
not
to
mention
these
courses
can
often
be
more
affordable
than
traditional
classes
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
downsides
to
opting
for
distance
learning
for
one
there
is
no
classroom
setting
so
teachers
may
be
less
available
to
answer
questions
face to face
or
have
limited
access
to
resources
moreover
distance
learning
requires
a
great
deal
of
self discipline
to
stay
on
top
of
course
material
and
complete
assignments
in
a
timely
manner
finally
this
type
of
learning
can
be
isolating
and
lack
the
social
aspects
that
come
with
traditional
in person
learning
overall
there
is
no
one size fits all
answer
when
it
comes
to
whether
students
should
take
advantage
of
distance
learning
opportunities
what
works
best
for
each
individual
student
will
depend
on
a
variety
of
factors
such
as
budget
goals
and
preferences
before
deciding
one
must
consider
the
pros
and
cons
to
make
a
well informed
decision
for
their
unique
situation
respecting
all
people
regardless
of
their
color
nationality
and
beliefs
has
the
potential
to
shape
a
better
future
for
us
all
and
discrimination
can
be
damaging
to
society
leading
to
feelings
of
insecurity
unfairness
and
distress
everyone
has
the
capacity
to
make
a
positive
difference
in
individual
and
community
life
it
is
through
self belief
and
convictions
that
people
can
have
the
assurance
to
be
able
to
reach
for
their
aspirations
as
well
as
create
a
more
amicable
and
unified
world
together
by
showing
love
and
respect
for
one
another
we
can
work
towards
achieving
a
unified
and
equitable
future
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
when
making
important
decisions
in
life
having
an
outside
source
to
help
make
choices
can
often
lead
to
more
successful
outcomes
as
they
are
often
experienced
professionals
who
can
offer
valuable
unbiased
advice
for
example
seeking
guidance
from
a
financial
advisor
when
making
major
investment
decisions
can
help
to
ensure
the
decisions
are
informed
by
the
current
market
conditions
and
will
ultimately
result
in
a
much
more
profitable
return
on
the
investment
similarly
when
considering
major
career
changes
a
school
or
university
career
advisor
can
help
identify
the
most
beneficial
courses
to
take
and
the
most
advantageous
job
prospects
available
to
an
individual
a
mentor
or
life
coach
can
be
incredibly
helpful
when
it
comes
to
personal
growth
by
cultivating
an
open
relationship
with
someone
who
has
more
experience
people
can
gain
the
insight
and
advice
they
need
when
navigating
personal
challenges
and
make
more
sound
and
holistic
decisions
as
they
evaluate
professional
and
personal
options
when
it
comes
to
life
s
important
decisions
having
the
right
guidance
can
be
a
game
changer
by
seeking
advice
from
experts
and
authorities
when
considering
major
life
decisions
people
can
gain
the
clarity
and
support
they
need
to
make
sound
decisions
that
lead
to
successful
outcomes
the
importance
of
focusing
on
a
single
task
and
avoiding
idling
can
not
be
overstated
with
so
many
distractions
in
our
daily
lives
it
s
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
and
start
putting
off
the
task
at
hand
by
avoiding
idling
and
staying
focused
on
the
task
at
hand
we
are
able
to
get
more
done
in
less
time
and
achieve
better
results
this
focus
on
singular
tasks
allows
us
to
dig
deeper
and
explore
the
details
of
the
task
more
thoroughly
making
sure
to
not
miss
any
important
components
however
there
are
still
some
limitations
to
focusing
on
a
single
task
by
being
so
focused
on
one
task
we
can
sometimes
lose
sight
of
the
bigger
picture
and
miss
out
on
how
the
task
fits
into
a
larger
set
of
goals
and
objectives
additionally
if
you
are
too
focused
on
one
task
you
might
become
burnt
out
or
lack
enthusiasm
for
completing
the
same
task
on
a
regular
basis
it
can
also
be
hard
to
maintain
focus
on
a
single
task
for
a
long
period
of
time
without
becoming
easily
distracted
due
to
fatigue
or
boredom
while
focusing
on
a
single
task
can
be
extremely
beneficial
and
help
you
achieve
better
results
it
is
important
to
remember
that
there
are
also
some
limitations
to
be
aware
of
taking
regular
breaks
and
varying
your
tasks
throughout
the
day
can
help
ensure
you
stay
focused
and
productive
is
something
many
of
us
strive
for
and
many
believe
it
is
attainable
through
hard
work
and
dedication
success
often
requires
enthusiasm
education
and
family
support
and
motivation
are
critical
for
powering
through
hard
work
and
obstacles
and
education
can
provide
the
knowledge
and
skills
necessary
to
succeed
family
support
can
provide
needed
encouragement
and
moral
support
to
persevere
when
going
through
trying
times
however
jealousy
and
envy
from
others
can
hinder
success
if
we
let
it
unfortunately
when
successful
people
are
admired
or
their
achievements
praised
it
can
often
breed
envy
or
jealousy
in
others
which
can
be
damaging
to
both
the
successful
person
and
those
who
feel
envious
a
plan
for
personal
success
should
include
setting
and
maintaining
goals
developing
a
positive
attitude
and
consistently
making
efforts
and
putting
in
the
necessary
work
to
reach
the
desired
objectives
self belief
and
perseverance
are
essential
components
of
success
and
it
is
important
to
be
prepared
for
the
possibility
of
failure
when
faced
with
failure
it
is
critical
to
take
the
time
to

in

s
fast paced
world
it
often
feels
impossible
to
stay
true
to
oneself
amidst
the
conflict
between
personal
identity
and
social
expectations
pressure
from
the
people
around
us
can
make
it
difficult
to
maintain
our
sense
of
self
especially
if
we
feel
like
conforming
to
the
expectations
of
the
society
is
our
only
option
people
are
driven
to
become
someone
else
in
order
to
fit
in
with
society
and
often
find
themselves
sacrificing
their
true
identity
in
the
process
this
need
to
conform
can
have
dangerous
repercussions
hiding
one
s
true
identity
may
cause
one
to
become
increasingly
out
of
touch
with
their
emotions
and
the
things
that
truly
matter
to
them
as
said
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
remaining
true
to
oneself
despite
the
obstacles
thrown
in
our
path
shows
tremendous
courage
and
resilience
throughout
history
there
have
been
countless
examples
of
people
who
have
defied
societal
expectation
to
remain
true
to
themselves
and
are
just
a
few
famous
figures
who
have
courageously
held
onto
their
identities
despite
enormous
pressure
to
conform
to
the
status
quo
it
is
not
easy
to
stand
up
against
the
expectations
of
society
but
by
remaining
true
to
oneself
one
can
gain
invaluable
clarity
peace
of
mind
and
strength
by
choosing
to
embrace
one
s
identity
in
spite
of
society
s
influences
one
can
remain
true
to
oneself
while
still
connecting
with
the
surrounding
world
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
modern
life
with
its
presence
felt
everywhere
from
the
workplace
to
the
home
while
technology
provides
numerous
positive
effects
for
our
lives
it
also
has
numerous
negative
consequences
one
of
the
major
positive
impacts
of
technology
is
the
ability
to
enhance
physical
growth
technology
has
improved
the
quality
of
life
of
people
especially
those
who
lead
an
active
lifestyle
by
increasing
the
range
of
activities
available
to
them
a
great
example
of
this
is
the
development
of
specialized
physical
training
software
and
devices
such
as
fitness
trackers
and
sports
gear
that
can
be
used
to
chart
progress
and
set
goals
for
athletes
of
all
levels
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
also
have
a
harmful
effect
on
physical
health
with
so
much
time
spent
on
devices
and
screens
people
are
becoming
increasingly
sedentary
leading
to
obesity
and
other
physical
health
issues
additionally
the
development
of
gaming
technology
has
been
linked
to
a
decrease
in
physical
activity
among
children
which
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
their
overall
growth
and
development
also
has
a
notable
impact
on
learning
both
in
terms
of
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
learning
experience
on
one
hand
technology
has
made
learning
easier
and
more
accessible
by
providing
access
to
educational
material
and
resources
at
any
time
and
any
place
on
the
other
hand
technology
has
made
it
easier
for
people
to
become
absorbed
in
entertainment
and
social
media
resulting
in
a
decrease
of
focus
on
more
important
topics
or
educational
activities
that
require
more
in depth
engagement
finally
technology
has
also
had
an
impact
on
time
management
and
lifestyle
changes
technology
can
help
people
become
more
productive
with
tools
such
as
online
calendars
and
task
management
apps
however
technology
can
also
lead
to
distraction
and
over dependence
people
can
become
overwhelmed
by
the
vast
number
of
tasks
and
end
up
spending
an
excessive
amount
of
time
on
their
devices
trying
to
stay
on
top
of
their
workload
in
order
to
reap
the
benefits
of
technology
while
mitigating
the
negative
impacts
it
is
important
to
set
boundaries
and
practice
healthy
device
usage
limiting
the
use
of
phones
tablets
and
computers
to
certain
times
or
utilizing
digital
wellness
solutions
such
as
screen
time
trackers
can
help
people
find
the
right
balance
between
technology
and
their
other
interests
and
activities
additionally
encouraging
physical
activity
and
setting
aside
time
for
self care
activities
such
as
reading
and
playing
sports
can
help
people
discover
a
healthier
lifestyle
when
it
comes
to
deciding
whether
to
take
college
classes
or
enter
the
military
at
an
early
age
it
is
important
for
students
to
consider
all
of
their
options
and
make
an
informed
decision
while
a
quick
decision
may
seem
like
the
best
option
rushing
into
a
decision
often
leads
to
regrets
in
the
long
run
elective
courses
offer
students
a
way
to
express
their
interests
and
figure
out
what
they
truly
desire
through
elective
courses
students
are
able
to
explore
different
topics
and
open
themselves
to
new
possibilities
these
courses
offer
a
chance
to
learn
about
diverse
areas
including
the
arts
history
and
science
by
trying
out
different
courses
students
can
deepen
their
understanding
of
their
preferred
subject
and
gain
an
insight
into
potential
future
paths
in
addition
elective
courses
can
provide
a
new
perspective
on
the
complex
world
around
us
by
taking
elective
courses
outside
of
a
student
s
comfort
zone
they
can
gain
vital
skills
such
as
creativity
and
problem solving
as
a
result
students
will
be
better
prepared
for
whatever
career
they
plan
to
pursue
to
sum
up
students
should
not
rush
into
deciding
which
college
classes
to
take
or
enter
the
military
at
an
early
age
elective
courses
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
explore
their

and
learn
what
they
truly
desire
gain
knowledge
on
diverse
topics
and
gain
valuable
skill
sets
ultimately
taking
the
time
to
evaluate
all
of
one
s
options
is
key
to
making
an
informed
decision
pressure
advice
from
others
and
social
stereotypes
can
have
a
powerful
effect
on
individuals
i
experienced
this
firsthand
when
i
was
growing
up
i
was
constantly
told
what
i
should
and
should
n t
be
doing
who
i
should
and
should
n t
be
friends
with
and
how
i
should
and
should
n t
dress
i
struggled
to
be
who
i
wanted
to
be
versus
who
others
expected
me
to
be
this
pressure
to
conform
to
the
opinions
and
expectations
of
others
is
found
in
many
cultures
each
with
their
own
unique
social
rules
for
example
in
there
is
a
greater
emphasis
on
traditional
values
and
respect
for
elders
disappointing
a
family
member
can
be
seen
as
a
serious
breach
of
protocol
and
can
be
met
with
disappointment
and
disapproval
these
experiences
demonstrate
how
powerfully
advice
from
others
and
peer
pressure
can
influence
our
behaviour
and
decisions
furthermore
when
combined
with
social
stereotypes
our
behaviour
and
beliefs
can
become
limited
and
even
harmful
we
must
be
aware
of
these
influences
and
strive
for
self acceptance
and
tolerance
of
others
through
recognizing
the
impact
of
advice
from
others
peer
pressure
and
social
stereotypes
we
can
gain
a
greater
understanding
of
the
effect
they
can
have
on
individuals
with
this
insight
we
can
work
to
develop
more
confidence
in
ourselves
and
our
beliefs
so
that
we
can
shape
our
own
paths
and
break
away
from
the
constraints
of
social
expectations
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
to
be
conscious
of
the
power
that
these
influences
can
have
in
shaping
our
beliefs
and
behaviour
we
must
be
mindful
of
our
own
personal
values
and
convictions
as
well
as
those
of
others
to
be
better
able
to
stay
true
to
ourselves

the
barriers
of
social
norms

one
of
the
main
benefits
of
having
a
positive
mental
is
that
it
can
help
create
a
feeling
of
well being
and
encourage
resilience
in
difficult
situations
allows
people
to
view
life
s
challenges
as
opportunities
rather
than
obstacles
giving
them
the
confidence
to
take
the
initiative
and
take
risks
for
example
someone
with
a
might
look
at
a
job
loss
as
a
chance
to
find
a
new
job
in
an
even
better
field
on
the
other
hand
a
could
be
detrimental
when
taken
to
extremes
if
someone
takes
a
too
far
they
can
become
overly
optimistic
leading
them
to
gloss
over
potential
risks
and
problems
for
instance
someone
with
a
pma
might
take
on
a
job
with
an
unrealistic
deadline
not
fully
understanding
the
difficulties
associated
with
it
ultimately
having
a
can
be
beneficial
in
many
situations
but
it
s
important
to
recognize
the
risks
involved
despite
the
fear
associated
with
failing
it
is
important
to
understand
that
failure
can
actually
lead
to
success
as
former
british
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
statement
emphasizes
the
importance
of
perseverance
and
enthusiasm
despite
all
setbacks
failure
can
be
an
essential
learning
tool
in
achieving
success
through
failure
we
can
find
out
what
works
and
develop
a
plan
for
effective
action
furthermore
failure
often
leads
to
a
greater
appreciation
for
success
when
it
is
achieved
through
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
failure
it
is
possible
to
develop
the
skills
necessary
to
reach
success
consequences
of
failing
must
be
taken
into
consideration
however
as
they
can
be
detrimental
to
success
for
instance
negative
consequences
of
failure
could
include
a
lack
of
confidence
a
fear
of
trying
again
or
discouragement
from
reaching
goals
therefore
it
is
important
to
remain
positive
and
motivated
despite
any
negative
consequences
of
failure
it
is
clear
that
failure
and
success
exist
in
equal
balance
and
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
failure
is
not
the
end
as
stated
success
and
failure
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
and
these
two
elements
are
key
parts
of
achieving
success
by
understanding
failure
and
how
it
can
lead
to
success
it
is
possible
to
remain
enthusiastic
and
continue
striving
towards
success
in
recent
years
much
research
has
been
done
to
determine
whether
true
self esteem
comes
from
praise
or
achievement
some
studies
have
indicated
that
children
who
are
regularly
praised
for
improvement
or
progress
experience
higher
self esteem
however
this
is
not
the
same
as
true
self esteem
true
self esteem
can
only
be
derived
from
a
sense
of
accomplishment
or
success
giving
praise
for
deficient
work
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
a
student
s
learning
in
these
cases
the
student
is
not
being
held
to
a
high
enough
standard
and
has
little
incentive
to
strive
for
excellence
if
praise
is
used
in
this
manner
it
may
actually
do
more
harm
than
good
by
instilling
in
the
student
a
false
sense
of
achievement
and
security
while
praise
can
be
an
important
factor
in
a
student
s
overall
success
it
can
not
be
the
sole
source
of
true
self esteem
is
ultimately
the
more
effective
source
of
true
self esteem
as
it
is
based
on
hard
work
and
tangible
results
ultimately
both
praise
and
achievement
can
be
essential
tools
for
helping
students
develop
self esteem
but
ultimately
achieving
success
is
the
best
way
for
students
to
gain
a
true
sense
of
self worth
example
the
actions
of
others
have
long
been
said
to
influence
us
as
individuals
it
is
widely
accepted
that
we
are
subject
to
the
influence
of
a
variety
of
people
and
institutions
in
our
lives
from
family
to
society
school
to
social
media
we
are
constantly
exposed
to
examples
of
how
others
behave
and
these
examples
shape
us
in
unpredictable
ways
take
our
family
for
instance
as
children
we
look
to
our
parents
to
learn
how
to
interact
with
the
world
both
what
is
appropriate
and
inappropriate
we
observe
their
behaviors
and
mannerisms
often
unconsciously
mimicking
the
way
they
communicate
and
interact
with
others
dynamics
are
incredibly
powerful
as
the
values
and
practices
we
observe
at
home
become
ingrained
in
our
personal
frameworks
influencing
our
decisions
now
and
in
the
future
on
a
larger
scale
the
influence
of
society
and
its
institutions
is
something
that
affects
us
all
it
is
no
mistake
that
the
perception
of
education
in
our
society
is
of
the
utmost
importance
we
associate
success
with
education
something
that
is
passed
down
to
us
in
various
ways
from
school
whether
it
s
through
the
lessons
we
learn
in
the
classroom
the
expectations
of
grades
or
the
aspirations
to
achieve
more
these
values
are
taught
to
us
from
a
young
age
creating
an
expectation
to
try
and
do
the
best
we
can
furthermore
social
media
has
become
another
incredibly
powerful
influence
in
recent
times
it
has
provided
us
with
a
platform
to
interact
with
other
people
providing
a
vast
space
for
examples
to
be
viewed
and
replicated
we
are
constantly
exposed
to
what
others
are
saying
doing
and
believing
creating
a
proliferation
of
ideals
and
beliefs
that
have
the
power
to
shape
us
though
the
influence
of
other
people
can
be
beneficial
to
a
certain
extent
it
is
important
to
note
that
example
is
not
the
only
thing
in
influencing
others
respect
dialogue
and
mutual
understanding
are
just
as
important
these
key
elements
only
come
into
play
when
we
learn
to
recognize
the
importance
of
listening
to
one
another
and
understanding
our
shared
humanity
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
an
impact
on
others
that
goes
far
beyond
just
the
doer
and
recipient
can
be
as
simple
as
offering
words
of
encouragement
volunteering
time
to
help
others
or
even
just
sharing
a
smile
with
a
stranger
these
small
acts
of
kindness
can
leave
a
lasting
impression
and
brighten

regardless
of
whether
or
not
others
notice
them
significantly
increase
happiness
in
the
people
performing
them
other
studies
have
shown
that
recipients
of
kind
acts
are
eight
times
more
likely
to
pass
on
that
kindness
to
someone
else
than
they
are
to
pass
on
negative
behavior
resulting
in
a
ripple effect
of
kindness
that
can
be
felt
in
our
communities
having
a
positive
mindset
is
key
to
understanding
and
promoting
kindness
and
this
starts
with
the
role
that
parents
play
parents
must
create
an
environment
in
which
kindness
is
emphasized
and
they
must
teach
their
children
to
be
kind
this
is
something
that
requires
effort
and
dedication
setting
a
good
example
and
encouraging
open
discussions
on
how
kindness
can
be
demonstrated
are
great
ways
to
foster
this
values
in
children

that
kindness
is
contagious

lives
by
opening
doorways
to
positive
physical
and
mental
health
benefits
improved
relationships
and
increased
success
in
conclusion
small
acts
of
kindness
have
far reaching
impacts
on
both
the
doers
and
recipients
and
should
be
encouraged

a
positive
mindset
and
being
kind
to
others

essential
part
of

is
becoming
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
students
who
are
looking
to
attend
classes
from
the
comfort
of
home
there
are
a
few
key
pros
and
cons
that
should
be
considered
when
deciding
if
distance
learning
is
the
right
option
for

students
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
distance
learning
is
the

have
greater
flexibility
in
terms
of
when
and
where
they
can
attend
class
making
it
easier
for
them
to
maintain
concentration
however
there
is
still
an
element
of
distraction
from
the
home
environment
particularly
when
it
comes
to
online
shopping
another
benefit
of
distance
learning
is
that
students
have
access
to
a
wide
range
of
learning
materials
such
as
online
books
and
videos
making

easier
to

distance
learning
offers
lower
costs
than
traditional
schooling
making
it
an
attractive
option
for
families
with
financial
constraints
yet
one
of
the
main
disadvantages
of
distance
learning
is
the
lack
of
social
contact
with
peers
and
teachers
additionally
online
bullying
is
a
real
issue
and
it
can
be
harder
to
detect
and
prevent
than
in person
bullying
for
these
reasons
some
students
may
benefit
from
the
increased
support
and
social
interaction
of
traditional
schools

is
a
great
option
for
students
who
are
looking
to
attend

curfews
often
have
a
bad
reputation
they
are
seen
as
too
restrictive
and
something
that
will
take
away
teenagers
freedom
but
imposing
a
curfew
on
teenagers
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
one
of
the
major
benefits
of
having
a
curfew
for
teenagers
is
that
it
can
help
them
establish
a
consistent
sleep
schedule
need
an
average
of
to
hours
of
sleep
to
help
with
physical
and
mental
development
and
having
a
timely
curfew
that
is
consistently
enforced
can
help
ensure
that
teens
get
the
sleep
they
need
has
also
shown
that
getting
enough
sleep
can
help
improve
mood
reduce
memory
issues
and
strengthen
mental
health
curfews
can
also
help
reduce
instances
of
illegal
activities
since
teens
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
after
dark
having
a
curfew
that
places
limits
on
the
amount
of
time
teenagers
can
stay
out
can
reduce
the
likelihood
of
these
activities
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
drawbacks
of
having
a
curfew
for
teenagers
some
have
argued
that
curfews
are
too
restrictive
and
may
result
in
teens
feeling
like
they
are
not
trusted
or
respected
it
can
also
create
a
feeling
of
rebellion
in
teens
and
increase
the
chances
of
them
breaking
the
curfew
leading
to
more
legal
issues
some
teens
may
be
living
in
unfavorable
home
environments
and
could
benefit
from
having
more
time
away
from
home
which
a
curfew
could
take
away
overall
while
a
curfew
for
teenagers
can
help
promote
healthy
sleep
schedules
and
possibly
reduce
illegal
activities
it
can
also
have
negative
ramifications
and
may
make
teens
feel
restrained
in
their
freedom
to
truly
evaluate
the
pros
and
cons
of

a

it
can
also
limit
students

in
the
long
run
as
changes
in

be
difficult
to

detrimental

in

his
statement
argues
that
example
is
the
only
thing
in
influencing

while
this
statement
holds
true
in
many
cases
it
is
not
a
requirement
for
influencing
people
in
fact
individuals
can
be
influenced
by
various
other
sources
such
as
television
the
internet
or
simply
by
other
people

ideas
for
example
when
a
person
views
an
influential
figure
and
is
inspired
by
her
ideals
she
may
start
to

the
characteristics
that
make
that
person
successful
that
does

necessarily
mean
she
has
had
direct
contact
with
the
individual
and
yet
she
is
still
being
influenced
in
addition
people
can
be
influenced
by
the
media
without
direct
contact
from
seeing
inspiring
and
powerful
messages
in
television
commercials
to
reading
motivating
articles
on
the
internet
people
are
often
moved
by
the
messages
they
ingest
without
ever
knowing
the
source
while
direct
example
certainly
has
its
place
as
a
powerful
tool
for
influence
it
is
not
the
only
one
and
certainly
not
the
only
way
to
affect
the
behavior
of
others
with
the
myriad
of
possible
influences
available
to
people
direct
example
is
just
one
small
piece
of
the
puzzle
technology
has
made
a
vast
impact
on
people
s
lives
in
the
past
several
decades
despite
popular
opinion
this
impact
is
overwhelmingly
positive
leading

quality
of

unprecedented
opportunities
for

advancement
experts
have
found
that
technology
can
help
people
improve
their
productivity
as
well
as
their
motivation
for

studies
conducted
by

have
shown
that
technology
can
improve
people
s
ability
to

additionally
texting
has
been
found
to
improve
people
s
mental
well being
by
facilitating
daily
communication
with
friends
and

further
evidence
suggests
technology
can
help
people
establish
greater
autonomy
and
express
themselves
creatively
for
instance
smartphone
applications
provide
tools
for
people
to
document
and
express
their
daily
lives
from

to

listening
to
advice
from
other
people
can
be
beneficial
in
more
ways
than
one
it
can
offer
a
new
perspective
on
a
given
situation
which
can
sometimes
be
beneficial
in
finding
solutions
if

a

may
offer
a
different
way
of
tackling
a
work
problem
that
you
had
n t
thought
of
before
secondly
it
can
provide
encouragement
and
emotional
support
so
even
if
you
do
not
need
or
want
their
help
it
can
still
be
beneficial
to
hear
them
out
for
instance
if
you
are
feeling
overwhelmed
a
friend
of
yours
may
offer
words
of
validation
and
understanding
that
can
make
you
feel
better
about
the
situation
finally
listening
to
advice
may
also
help
build
relationships
with
others
for
instance
if
a
coworker
offers
their
advice
on
an
issue
you
re
dealing
with
it
can
foster
a
sense
of
rapport
and
trust
between
the
two
of
you
overall
listening
to
advice
from
others
can
be
advantageous
in
many
ways
whether
it

gaining
a
new
perspective
seeking
emotional
validation
or
building

graduating
early
from

school
and
working
for
a

can
have
lasting
benefits
for
students
for

they
can
take
that
time
to
save
up
money
for
college
costs
although
tuition
and
fees
for
college
are
rising
year
after
year
students
who
work
before
college
and
carefully
manage
their
finances
can
put
themselves
in
a
better
position
to
afford
college
tuition
furthermore
the
experiences
gained
from
working
will
help
mature
students
and
provide
them
with
skills
such
as
time
management
that
will
be
invaluable
in
college
on
the
other
hand
some
may
argue
that
taking
a
year
off
to
work
can
be
a
deterrent
to
college
motivation
and
preparation
students
who
do
choose
to
graduate
early
and
take
a
year
off
before
college
may
not
feel
adequately
prepared
for
the
academic
rigor
that
college
demands
and
given
the
competition
to
get
into

a
gap

some
potential
universities
to
look
unfavorably
on

application
graduating
early
and
working
for
a
year
before
college
has
proven
to
be
a
beneficial
experience
for
many
students
the
financial
and
personal
growth
opportunities
that
it
provides
may
ultimately
be
invaluable
to
success
in
college
and
beyond
individual
character
is
shaped
by
a
variety
of
forces
beyond
one
s
control
and
this
idea
is
reflected
in
the
quote
by
it
is
not
what
we
have
but
what
we
use
that
makes
us
rich
this
notion
applies
to
both
material
and
immaterial
wealth
while
some
may
be
born
with
an
abundance
of
natural
resources
it
is
only
those
who
know
how
to
properly
use
and
appreciate
all
that
they
possess
that
can
truly
benefit
from
their
possessions
is
formed
by
the
physical
contexts
in
which
a
person
is
raised
as
well
as
the
values
morals
and
beliefs
that
are
instilled
in
them
from
society
the
quote
emphasizes
that
this
underlying
wealth
or
capital
must
be
recognized
and
put
to
use
in
order
to
see
the
greatest
value
in
other
words
we
must
be
purposeful
in
our
approach
to
whatever
resources
we
may
have
through
understanding
and
realizing
the
potential
of
our
possessions
we
can
be
more
successful
in
life
schooling
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
option
in
recent
times
and
it
is
important
to
assess
its
pros
and
cons
in
relation
to
traditional
in person
schooling
on
the
positive
side
the
advantages
of
online
schooling
include
flexibility
and
convenience
that
allows
students
to
work
at
their
own
pace
as
well
as
access
to
resources
online
however
there
are
some
notable
drawbacks
too
such
as
lacking
face to face
interaction
with
peers
or
teachers
which
is
essential
for
collaborating
and
gaining
insight
from
instructors
there
are
many
ways
students
can
receive
help
while
taking
online
classes
many
teachers
offer
additional
tutorials
or
written
feedback
to
help
students
understand
the
material
better
typically
have
online
resources
such
as
discussion
forums
or
virtual
conferences
that
allow
students
to
ask
questions
and
stay
in
touch
with
their
teachers
and
classmates
however
there
are
some
potential
problems
that
students
may
experience
with
online
classes
for
example
students
may
struggle
to
understand
the
material
and
feel
lack
of
motivation
and
commitment
towards
it
and
may
forget
assignments
due
to
lack
of
reminders
when
it
comes
to
whether
or
not
online
schooling
should
be
offered
there
are
both
arguments
in
favor
and
against
proponents
of
online
schooling
argue
that
it
offers
students
flexibility
and
access
to
resources
that
in person
classes
can
not
critics
on
the
other
hand
contend
that
online
schooling
can
not
replace
in person
classes
as
it
leaves
out
crucial
aspects
of
student
development
such
as
collaboration
and
interpersonal
communication
ultimately
in
order
to
decide
whether
online
schooling
is
beneficial
or
detrimental
it
is
important
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
form
of
learning
it
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
for
high
school
students
to
complete
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
the
traditional
four year
model
there
are
many
advantages
to
this
accelerated
approach
such
as
being
able
to
take
classes
before
and
after
school
in
order
to
cover
the
content
more
quickly
and
the
ability
to
forego
taking
elective
courses
in
order
to
focus
on
core
courses
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
can
also
better
prepare
students
for
college
as
they
may
be
able
to
take
college
classes
as
early
as
the
end
of
their
junior
year
however
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
students
may
find
themselves
feeling
increased
fatigue
from
coming
early
and
staying
late
in
order
to
be
able
to
complete
the
required
courses
additionally
students
may
be
missing
out
on
important
developmental
experiences
which
can
come
from
taking
elective
classes
and
socializing
with
peers
during
lunch
and
other
in school
activities
before
deciding
to
take
on
the
challenge
of
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
students
should
consider
the
pros
and
cons
carefully
in
a
world
filled
with
various
opinions
values
and
beliefs
it
is
all
too
easy
to
feel
lost
and
confused
it
can
be
hard
to
remain
true
to
yourself
amidst
the
arguments
pressures
and
judgements
of
others
however
it
is
absolutely
vital
to
stay
true
to
who
you
are
despite
the
external
pressure
that
society
places
on
you
unfortunately
many
people
look
to
others
around
them
and
feel
as
if
they
need
to
conform
in
order
to
fit
in
they
might
take
on
certain
attitudes
or
interests
that
do
not
reflect
their
true
values
this
can
lead
to
a
kind
of
disconnect
between
the
person
s
inner
self
and
their
external
self
which
can
cause
many
difficulties
in
life
the
best
way
to
counteract
this
is
to
make
sure
that
you
take
the
time
to
know
yourself
understand
your
values
and
trust
in
your
opinions
it
is
important
to
remember
that
no
one
else
can
decide
how
you
should
live
your
life
you
must
make
the
effort
to
stand
up
for
your
convictions
regardless
of
the
demands
of
those
around
you
furthermore
it
is
important
to
assert
your
emotions
and
acknowledge
what
you
are
feeling
ignoring
or
repressing
your
emotions
can
only
lead
to
distress
in
the
long
run
it
is
easy
to
allow
external
forces
to
shape
your
identity
but
asserting
and
embracing
your
own
identity
is
the
most
rewarding
path
in
life
once
you
accept
yourself
and
the
unique
perspectives
and
values
that
make
you
who
you
are
you
are
better
able
to
take
part
in
meaningful
conversations
and
experiences
with
others
as
well
as
navigate
through
life
s
demands
environment
and
culture
are
all
integral
factors
and
building
blocks
for
forming
a
person
s
character
lays
the
foundation
for
essential
skills
relationships
and
beliefs
that
shape
the
person
s
sense
of
identity
for
years
to
come
a
person
s
environment
is
the
place
in
which
they
interact
with
people
and
the
world
in
a
positive
or
negative
manner
the
culture
shapes
a
person
s
beliefs
attitudes
and
values
while
surrendering
to
certain
ways
of
life
in
the
community
growing
up
a
child
is
exposed
to
a
diverse
range
of
people
situations
and
beliefs
those
experiences
as
will
their
environment
shape
the
way
the
person
behaves
and
reacts
to
life
a
negative
environment
for
example
may
cause
the
child
to
grow
to
be
anxious
and
insecure
in
contrast
a
positive
environment
may
encourage
a
child
to
be
more
social
compassionate
and
imaginative
the
culture
of
the
community
is
the
basis
of
shared
norms
and
values
such
as
respect
for
elders
and
cooperation
among
peers
these
can
form
the
core
values
of
the
mindset
providing
the
basis
for
a
person
s
ethical
views
and
interpersonal
attitudes
the
overall
effect
of
these
key
factors
in
a
person
s
development
helps
define
their
character
and
determine
how
they
react
and
interact
in
society
through
the
lens
of
childhood
environment
and
culture
a
person
can
come
to
understand
how
multiple
facets
of
a
person
s
formative
life
events
have
molded
their
character
today
in
the
modern
world
technology
plays
an
increasingly
large
role
in
our
daily
lives
while
the
limitation
of
physical
contact
between
people
may
be
considered
a
drawback
of
technology
it
is
not
the
only
possible
outcome
there
are
undeniable
benefits
to
technological
advancement
particularly
in
terms
of
reducing
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
complete
daily
tasks
and
increasing
our
autonomy
and
convenience
one
distinct
advantage
to
technology
is
that
it
reduces
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
complete
mundane
tasks
for
example
the
introduction
of
automated
machines
has
drastically
reduced
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
manufacture
products
similarly
online
banking
services
help
people
manage
their
finances
faster
through
the
convenience
of
automation
not
only
does
technology
reduce
the
time
spent
on
tasks
it
also
provides
greater
autonomy
and
convenience
to
people
s
lives
with
the
help
of
smartphones
and
other
devices
people
can
access
a
plethora
of
information
meaning
they
have
access
to
a
host
of
tools
and
knowledge
at
the
touch
of
a
button
this
makes
tasks
that
would
have
otherwise
been
difficult
or
impossible
not
long
ago
significantly
easier
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
technology
can
provide
a
substantial
positive
impact
on
people
s
lives
by
reducing
the
amount
of
time
required
to
do
certain
tasks
and
providing
greater
autonomy
and
convenience
technology
has
the
potential
to
make
life
easier
and
simpler
for
everyone
the
world
today
is
connected
in
ways
that
were
previously
unimaginable
technology
has
allowed
us
to
easily
and
quickly
connect
with
friends
family
and
people
from
distant
lands
all
from
the
comfort
of
our
own
home
it
has
opened
up
a
world
of
entertainment
from
to
games
and
offers
new
opportunities
to
collaborate
and
create
when
it
comes
to
studying
technology
has
allowed
students
to
access
vast
resources
of
information
from
online
tutoring
to
projects
that
may
have
otherwise
been
impossible
to
complete
it
can
help
us
organize
our
lives
allowing
us
to
communicate
and
make
plans
easily
the
benefits
of
technology
do
n t
end
there
its
ability
to
connect
us
has
helped
to
not
only
bring
people
closer
together
but
also
to
spread
knowledge
and
culture
networking
has
created
a
platform
for
people
to
share
experiences
and
for
social
movements
to
take
hold
and
advocate
change
without
technology
the
world
we
live
in
today
would
be
unrecognizable
would
be
much
more
difficult
traveling
would
take
longer
and
advancement
would
be
much
slower
technology
has
positively
impacted
our
lives
in
many
ways
providing
us
with
a
truly
interconnected
world
the
importance
of
technology
in
the
world
today
can
not
and
should
not
be
undervalued

more
quickly
in
addition
collaboration
can
result
in
the
acquisition
of

knowledge
due
to
the
diversity
of
perspectives

be
able
to
approach

work
is
an
effective
way
to
make

spending
time
with

can
lead
to
a
more
fulfilling
workplace
environment
to
sum
up
there
are
many
advantages
to
working
in
a

from
saving
time
and
incorporating

to
making

extending
school
one
and
a
half
hours
each
day
has
potential
benefits
of
providing
students
with
more
opportunities
for
success
it
could
enable
longer
class
sessions
allowing
for
more
in depth
subject
material
to
be
taught
as
well
as
more
time
for
extra curricular
activities
or
for
additional
help
from
teachers
and
staff
furthermore
this
could
result
in
improved
student
engagement
better
academic
performance
and
higher
graduation
rates
at
the
same
time
extending
school
each
day
could
lead
to
fatigue
and
stress
for
both
students
and
staff
there
is
also
a
potential
for
significant
increases
in
operational
costs
for
teachers
administrators
and
support
staff
despite
potential
drawbacks
longer
school
days
could
lead
to
more
productive
and
meaningful
learning
as
more
time
could
be
devoted
to
reading
laboratory
experiments
field
trips
or
project
based
learning
it
could
also
provide
more
opportunities
for
physical
activity
as
students
would
have
more
time
for
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
and
potentially
introduce
students
to
more
diverse
activities
extending
school
one
and
a
half
hours
each
day
could
also
help
motivate
students
by
providing
a
sense
of
purpose
and
helping
them
stay
focused
by
providing
predictable
and
organized
routines
this
could
also
give
students
the
opportunity
to
develop
better
time
management
skills
as
they
would
have
additional
time
to
plan
and
prepare
for
their
studies
and
activities
the
research
findings
indicate
that
extending
school
one
and
a
half
hours
each
day
has
the
potential
to
have
positive
impacts
on
student
learning
and
to
motivate
students
to
strive
for
greater
success
yet
there
are
also
potential
drawbacks
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
all
factors
should
be
assessed
and
weighed
carefully
before
implementing
longer
school
days
reaching
goals
helps
to
build
an
individual
s
self esteem
in
many
ways
accomplishing
a
goal
gives
an
individual
a
renewed
sense
of
self confidence
and
a
feeling
of
self efficacy
they
can
use
to
tackle
the
next
goal
this
increase
in
self confidence
pushes
them
to
persist
in
their
efforts
to
reach
the
goals
they
have
set
for
themselves
furthermore
reaching
a
goal
gives
an
individual
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
self praise
that
can
last
long
after
the
goal
has
been
achieved
recent
studies
have
shown
that
when
people
make
progress
towards
a
goal
their
self esteem
increases
for
instance
athletes
demonstrate
improved
self concept
after
successfully
completing
a
challenging
physical
task
such
as
running
a
race
or
performing
a
difficult
routine
in
a
gymnastics
event
additionally
students
who
make
progress
in
their
academic
endeavors
often
report
higher
levels
of
self esteem
when
students
improve
their
grades
their
self concept
tends
to
improve
as
well
overall
the
evidence
confirms
that
achieving
goals
helps
enhance
an
individual
s
self esteem
in
multiple
ways
accomplishment
of
a
goal
not
only
provides
an
individual
with
long lasting
satisfaction
but
also
pushes
them
to
continue
striving
for
greatness
with
little
effort
these
positive
behaviors
can
help
individuals
feel
more
empowered
and
confident
in
their
endeavors
as
students
begin
to
develop
a
sense
of
individual
identity
the
career
paths
they
pursue
change
drastically
elementary
school
students
are
typically
unaware
of
the
concept
of
a
long term
job
and
tend
to
approach
career
choices
from
a
more
whimsical
perspective
on
the
other
hand
middle
school
students
start
to
recognize
the
consequences
of
their
decisions
and
may
begin
to
commit
to
a
career
path
this
age
group
may
also
begin
to
explore
the
creation
of
a
resume
and
the
development
of
professional
skills
unfortunately
many
adults
may
view
teenagers
as
too
inexperienced
or
immature
to
decide
on
a
career
however
this
belief
fails
to
acknowledge
the
reality
of
the
modern
world
in
which
teenagers
can
commit
to
long term
goals
earlier
on
young
people
can
demonstrate
the
breadth
of
their
experience
and
knowledge
which
shows
that
not
all
adolescents
are
the
same
even
with
the
ambition
and
drive
to
pursue
a
career
teenagers
still
face
unique
challenges
they
may
not
have
the
educational
background
or
internships
necessary
to
enter
professional
fields
moreover
due
to
their
age
there
are
limits
to
the
degree
of
responsibility
they
can
take
on
ultimately
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
requires
the
willingness
to
learn
and
the
patience
to
maneuver
through
an
ever changing
landscape
famously
competitive
rivals
and
both
agree
that
allowing
students
to
design
their
own
summer
projects
can
be
immensely
beneficial
for
their
overall
academic
growth
and
development
while
emphasizes
that
it
encourages
creativity
and
the
joy
of
learning
through
an
independent
approach
points
out
that
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
students
to
develop
a
sense
of
ownership
and
autonomy
over
their
work
real life
examples
show
that
students
have
sometimes
struggled
to
adhere
to
the
expectations
of
their
teachers
when
completing
summer
projects
which
reflects
how
allowing
students
to
design
their
own
projects
can
be
less
stressful
for
them
and
more
enjoyable
too
this
helps
reduce
stress
levels
for
students
enabling
them
to
focus
on
the
quality
of
their
work
and
curate
something
unique
and
insightful
ultimately
students
can
benefit
from
designing
their
own
projects
as
it
encourages
them
to
be
proactive
in
their
learning
journey
challenge
their
own
limits
and
embrace
the
creative
freedom
available
to
them
as
i
reflect
on
my
friendships
i
m
grateful
to
have
so
many
people
in
my
life
that
have
shared
their
and
with
me
it
is
truly
a
luxury
that
many
people
do
not
have
and
can
be
invaluable
resources
for
making
the
right
choices
particularly
when
it
comes
to
making
difficult
decisions
access
to
this
information
helps
us
better
understand
activities
quickly
as
well
as
consider
multiple
points
of
view
that
we
may
otherwise
ignore
from
the
insight
gleaned
from
others
we
can
gain
an
increased
appreciation
of
certain
activities
by
understanding
the
reasoning
behind
them
and
how
we
can
best
apply
them
and
can
also
help
us
become
stronger
knowing
the
challenges
that
others
have
faced
and
how
they
overcame
them
provides
us
with
strength
and
motivation
to
pursue
our
goals
we
are
better
able
to
trust
our
instinct
and
bypass
any
doubt
that
would
otherwise
prevent
us
from
reaching
our
highest
potential
by
understanding
the
choices
that
led
to
past
successes
we
can
increase
our
level
of
confidence
in
the
decisions
that
we
make
in
conclusion
i
can
not
emphasize
enough
the
importance
of
and
in
helping
us
make
the
right
choices
understand
activities
more
quickly
and
become
stronger
it
serves
as
a
reminder
that
no
matter
our
current
situation
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
the
people
around
us
and
how
their
experiences
can
benefit
our
own
this
knowledge
should
be
duly
valued
and
i
am
fortunate
to
have
such
strong
support
of
friends
who
are
willing
to
share
with
me
times
we
find
ourselves
self imposing
limitations
in
areas
of
our
lives
where
we
feel
we
do
not
excel
or
where
we
are
uncomfortable
this
can
be
detrimental
to
our
own
personal
growth
both
professionally
and
personally
dissatisfaction
is
natural
and
healthy
as
it
often
encourages
us
to
strive
for
more
and
become
better
versions
of
ourselves
however
it
can
also
be
dangerous
if
taken
too
far
it
is
wise
to
endeavor
to
constantly
learn
new
things
and
strive
further
than
our
current
capabilities
continually
striving
for
more
can
help
us
become
more
confident
rounded
individuals
this
is
reflected
in
s
statement
that
we
should
always
be
going
after
growth
as
people
are
constantly
gaining
knowledge
and
pushing
boundaries
to
reach
some
semblance
of
harmony
in
their
lives
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
widening
one
s
perspective
and
expanding
our
knowledge
learning
options
have
become
increasingly
popular
over
the
past
decade
with
growing
numbers
of
students
relying
on
online
or
video
conferencing
classes
to
attend
school
from
home
while
the
ability
to
learn
from
one
s
own
home
offers
numerous
advantages
such
as
increased
flexibility
lower
costs
and
more
control
over
one
s
schedule
there
are
still
a
number
of
potential
issues
that
must
be
taken
into
account
such
as
the
potential
for
students
to
become
easily
distracted
or
procrastinate
it
is
important
to
consider
both
the
positive
and
negative
impacts
of
distance
learning
on
one
hand
there
is
evidence
that
distance
learning
can
offer
superior
academic
outcomes
due
to
the
focus
that
students
have
while
working
independently
in
addition
many
students
who
may
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
more
traditional
environment
find
increased
comfort
and
freedom
in
the
home based
setting
on
the
other
hand
there
is
also
the
potential
for
this
type
of
learning
to
lead
to
poorer
academic
performance
due
to
the
lack
of
social
interaction
and
peer
motivation
in
conclusion
although
there
are
both
positives
and
negatives
when
it
comes
to
providing
distance
learning
options
the
pros
do
appear
to
outweigh
the
cons
as
such
it
is
essential
that
schools
embrace
this
technology
and
provide
the
necessary
resources
to
help
students
take
advantage
of
these
opportunities
and
maximize
their
potential
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
could
potentially
provide
students
with
a
number
of
benefits
with
additional
time
students
could
benefit
from
smaller
class
sizes
less
competition
for
resources
and
access
to
more
subjects
furthermore
by
allowing
students
to
have
more
time
for
projects
and
assignments
they
may
improve
their
academic
knowledge
and
skills
studies
show
that
longer
school
days
can
provide
students
with
more
time
for
socializing
which
can
have
positive
effects
on
physical
and
mental
health
however
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
could
have
potential
negatives
as
well
this
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
stress
levels
since
students
will
have
less
time
for
rest
and
leisure
activities
furthermore
without
adequate
compensation
teachers
may
struggle
to
accommodate
the
extra
burden
leading
to
poorer
overall
educational
standards
additionally
there
could
be
drawbacks
to
the
community
longer
school
day
may
mean
that
fewer
people
are
available
to
work
as
well
as
decrease
job
availability
for
those
providing
after
school
activities
for
children
in
conclusion
while
there
are
potential
benefits
for
students
in
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
there
are
also
possible
drawbacks
for
teachers
students
and
the
community
ultimately
a
decision
should
be
made
carefully
and
include
taking
into
consideration
things
like
potential
physical
and
mental
health
effects
educational
benefits
and
potential
community
impacts
i
will
begin
by
creating
a
comprehensive
study
schedule
that
will
span
across
the
entire
semester
this
will
include
blocks
of
time
dedicated
to
studying
each
subject
as
well
as
breaks
to
allow
for
mental
and
physical
rest
during
my
assigned
study
time
i
will
focus
on
actively
engaging
with
the
material
and
studying
the
content
that
is
covered
on
any
upcoming
tests
in
addition
to
the
assigned
reading
i
will
also
make
a
plan
to
track
my
progress
throughout
the
semester
which
will
help
me
to
identify
any
areas
i
need
to
focus
on
more
in
order
to
improve
my
grades
as
i
receive
feedback
from
tests
and
other
assignments
i
will
make
adjustments
to
my
study
plan
as
needed
in
order
to
ensure
success
in
my
classes
first
impressions
are
not
only
invaluable
in
our
everyday
lives
but
they
often
have
long lasting
repercussions
from
a
job
interview
to
a
romantic
first
date
the
first
impressions
we
give
can
make
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
i
remember
when
i
applied
for
my
first
job
after
university
i
was
extremely
nervous
going
in
for
my
interview
the
interviewer
s
initial
impression
of
me
may
have
been
the
deciding
factor
in
landing
the
job
although
i
was
anxious
i
was
able
to
put
together
a
successful
interview
and
went
on
to
receive
the
position
in
this
case
my
good
first
impression
secured
me
a
job
i
was
highly
qualified
for
but
could
not
have
gotten
without
making
a
strong
initial
connection
this
concept
applies
to
many
other
areas
of
life
from
relationships
to
work
performance
i
have
observed
in
my
peers
and
coworkers
that
those
who
present
themselves
well
to
their
superiors
often
receive
more
favorable
treatment
in
the
workplace
the
ones
that
put
more
effort
into
making
positive
connections
with
their
peers
or
colleagues
prove
to
be
more
successful
as
well
it
is
essential
to
remember
that
first
impressions
are
only
part
of
the
equation
and
do
not
determine
the
outcome
of
the
situation
despite
this
there
is
still
no
denying
that
forming
a
positive
rapport
from
the
start
can
open
many
doors
and
cause
long term
benefits
while
the
pressure
of
making
a
good
first
impression
can
be
daunting
at
times
the
effort
is
usually
worth
it
in
the
end
break
is
an
important
time
for
students
to
recharge
and
refocus
after
a
busy
school
year
it
gives
them
a
much
needed
respite
from
academic
pressures
a
precious
chance
to
relax
and
the
opportunity
to
pursue
hobbies
and
interests
that
are
not
always
available
during
the
rest
of
the
year
for
those
juggling
multiple
responsibilities
such
as
jobs
summer
break
is
a
vital
opportunity
to
catch
up
on
rest
spend
time
with
family
and
plan
for
the
upcoming
school
year
taking
away
the
summer
break
could
also
put
students
mental
health
at
risk
with
no
break
they
may
become
burned
out
and
overwhelmed
trying
to
manage
both
their
academic
and
personal
lives
furthermore
shortening
the
summer
break
would
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
break
from
their
habits
explore
new
interests
and
gain
the
perspective
and
balance
they
need
to
be
successful
we
must
recognize
the
value
of
summer
break
for
students
and
oppose
any
efforts
to
reduce
it
significantly
many
of
us
struggle
with
choosing
the
right
character
or
path
to
follow
in
life
it
can
be
a
daunting
process
to
select
which
direction
to
take
however
doing
so
can
ultimately
lead
to
more
success
and
satisfaction
in
the
end
it
s
similar
to
choosing
a
partner
or
learning
from
a
teacher
both
require
careful
consideration
of
individual
values
and
principles
that
determine
who
you
will
be
spending
your
time
with
or
learning
from
taking
a
step
back
to
analyze
what
you
need
in
order
to
grow
is
essential
for
example
if
you
re
looking
for
a
romantic
partner
you
must
think
of
the
qualities
you
re
looking
for
and
how
those
are
compatible
with
the
type
of
person
you
are
when
it
comes
to
learning
from
a
teacher
the
process
might
be
similar
but
the
questions
become
what
can
i
learn
from
this
person
and
what
skills
will
i
leave
with
once
a
character
has
been
chosen
it
s
important
to
stay
true
to
one
s
own
sense
of
self
this
means
being
able
to
face
any
unforeseen
challenges
without
straying
from
the
path
towards
your
final
goals
in
life
through
determination
and
perseverance
one
can
find
their
way
to
a
successful
and
fulfilling
life
learning
art
is
a
valuable
and
enriching
experience
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
all
ages
throughout
history
different
types
of
art
classes
have
emerged
including
painting
woodworking
music
drama
and
even
dance
famous
expressionists
such
as
and
have
helped
to
promote
the
importance
of
art
for
generations
musical
instruments
such
as
the
harp
and
the
flute
can
often
be
found
in
art
classes
as
well
as
popular
plays
like
and
and
the
of
errors
taking
an
elective
course
provides
a
much
more
beneficial
experience
when
compared
to
a
required
class
electives
allow
students
to
choose
classes
that
offer
more
interests
and
learning
opportunities
that
are
not
necessarily
offered
in
the
required
classes
this
allows
them
to
explore
different
activities
that
they
may
not
normally
seek
out
encouraging
them
to
develop
new
skills
and
gain
knowledge
outside
of
their
traditionally
structured
courses
additionally
allowing
students
to
choose
their
own
electives
gives
them
a
level
of
autonomy
helping
to
foster
independence
and
creativity
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
students
to
find
classes
that
are
engaging
and
stimulating
for
them
which
can
lead
to
more
involved
learning
this
is
far
more
beneficial
to
having
a
required
class
where
the
content
may
not
be
viewed
as
exciting
or
engaging
by
the
student
resulting
in
a
lack
of
interest
and
in
worse
case
scenarios
failure
extending
the
school
day
appears
to
be
an
increasingly
popular
solution
as
parents
teachers
and
administrators
work
to
improve
academic
success
there
are
numerous
arguments
both
for
and
against
longer
school
days
and
it
is
important
to
examine
all
of
them
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
one
of
the
main
arguments
in
favor
of
extending
the
school
day
is
that
it
can
give
students
more
time
to
focus
on
their
academic
studies
and
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
material
this
could
lead
to
better
test
scores
and
an
improvement
in
educational
outcomes
additionally
a
longer
school
day
could
also
provide
more
time
for
clubs
sports
and
other
extracurricular
activities
allowing
for
more
opportunities
for
students
to
explore
their
interests
and
connect
with
their
peers
however
there
are
also
several
potential
downsides
to
a
longer
school
day
longer
school
day
may
lead
to
students
feeling
increasingly
stressed
out
and
exhausted
furthermore
when
school
begins
too
early
and
ends
too
late
students
may
be
robbed
of
important
sleep
which
could
lead
to
physical
and
mental
health
issues
in
conclusion
while
extending
the
school
day
can
certainly
have
some
benefits
for
students
such
as
giving
them
more
time
for
academic
and
social
activities
it
is
essential
to
weigh
the
potential
costs
as
well
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
school
and
parents
to
decide
what
is
right
for
their
particular
communities
taking
into
consideration
the
students
needs
for
adequate
sleep
and
for
other
parts
of
their
lives
outside
of
school
it
is
widely
believed
that
success
in
this
world
requires
more
than
hard
work
and
dedication
it
requires
taking
brave
and
risky
decisions
a
great
example
of
this
idea
is
the
story
of
an
ambitious
young
professional
who
was
looking
to
make
a
career
change
although
his
family
had
been
advising
him
to
stay
in
his
current
field
his
heart
was
telling
him
to
take
a
chance
despite
the
risks
followed
his
intuition
and
made
the
move
he
soon
found
himself
quickly
climbing
the
career
ladder
and
achieving
more
than
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
the
importance
of
tuning
out
the
voice
of
reason
and
instead
following
our
hearts
can
not
be
understated
often
we
measure
success
within
a
narrow
scope
of
what
is
expected
of
us
and
we
forget
that
what
can
truly
make
us
successful
is
found
in
our
personal
journey
it
is
not
uncommon
to
make
mistakes
and
even
encounter
failure
along
the
way
but
if
we
use
these
moments
to
grow
and
gain
a
better
understanding
of
ourselves
we
will
eventually
find
true
success
overall
there
is
great
reward
in
taking
chances
and
in
learning
from
the
unexpected
paths
we
find
ourselves
on
it
can
help
us
break
free
of
assumptions
of
what
success
looks
like
and
allow
us
to
establish
our
own
definitions
of
success
and
happiness
ultimately
the
advice
to
follow
our
hearts
is
not
just
an
old
wives
tale
it
is
essential
for
achieving
success
in
life
was
an
advocate
for
self reliance
and
his
views
have
been
passed
down
for
generations
he
maintained
that
one
should
never
try
and
become
someone
else
no
matter
what
the
pressure
may
be
in
order
to
fit
in
but
instead
be
true
to
oneself
he
argued
that
if
each
individual
strived
to
be
their
own
unique
and
individual
person
that
person
would
be
able
to
make
more
of
an
impact
on
the
world
than
if
they
were
just
a
clone
of
someone
else
in
order
to
get
ahead
in
life
this
has
become
especially
relevant
in
today
s
society
as
the
lure
of
material
goods
is
often
seen
as
more
important
than
core
values
and
beliefs
this
theme
of
being
yourself
is
sometimes
met
with
criticism
or
even
ridicule
from
people
with
different
points
of
view
yet
argued
that
this
attitude
is
essential
in
order
to
bring
about
positive
change
he
even
argued
that
trying
to
emulate
someone
else
in
order
to
get
a
job
could
be
unsuccessful
because
of
an
inability
to
create
any
original
ideas
or
thoughts
for
it
was
clear
that
being
yourself
and
finding
one
s
inner
autonomy
was
essential
to
growth
and
development
after
researching
extensively
into
different
potential
career
paths
i
have
shortlisted
my
top
options
i
have
read
up
on
the
various
qualifications
responsibilities
and
other
important
aspects
of
each
one
and
weighed
them
up
against
my
skills
and
experience
now
i
am
planning
to
discuss
my
top
with
my
parents
and
teachers
to
get
their
opinions
on
which
one
could
potentially
benefit
me
the
best
first
impressions
are
incredibly
powerful
and
should
not
be
taken
lightly
from
a
single
look
we
can
assess
a
person
s
personality
intelligence
and
even
their
trustworthiness
but
what
happens
if
that
judgment
proves
to
be
inaccurate
if
the
person
we
initially
took
an
immediate
dislike
to
turns
out
to
be
a
valuable
friend
or
mentor
what
if
we
find
out
further
down
the
line
that
their
first
impression
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
character
at
all
i
believe
that
first
impressions
can
be
changed
with
the
right
combination
of
charisma
and
personality
having
charisma
and
personality
are
essential
for
creating
a
good
first
impression
as
they
can
help
people
overcome
any
negative
preconceptions
they
might
have
is
often
seen
as
an
innate
quality
but
it
can
also
be
developed
over
time
as
people
learn
how
to
use
gestures
expressions
and
body
language
to
influence
the
people
around
them
on
the
other
hand
is
about
presenting
the
best
version
of
yourself
in
any
given
situation
and
is
something
that
can
be
worked
on
with
practice
to
illustrate
my
point
consider
the
following
scenario
i
recently
met
someone
who
i
felt
an
immediate
dislike
for
but
after
getting
to
know
them
better
and
seeing
them
in
different
environments
i
realized
that
my
first
impression
was
wrong
this
experience
taught
me
that
there
s
more
to
a
person
than
their
first
impression
it
also
taught
me
that
it
s
important
to
be
open minded
and
willing
to
give
people
a
chance
regardless
of
first
impressions
in
conclusion
first
impressions
can
be
changed
by
combining
charisma
and
personality
in
a
positive
way
people
can
work
to
create
a
better
first
impression
and
challenge
negative
preconceptions
ultimately
it
s
important
to
give
people
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
be
willing
to
give
them

sentiment
the

people
of
today
undoubtedly
embody
take
for

the
founder
of
famously
took
a
huge
risk
in
when
he
resigned
from
his
highly
successful
job
in
finance
with
no
clear
plan
for
what
followed
nonetheless
he
made
the
leap
of
faith
and
invested
everything
he
had
into
launching
and
the
rest
is
history
quickly
rose
to
become
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
world
similarly
stories
of
personal
failure
and
eventual
success
are
ubiquitous
whether
it
be
a
friend
who
failed
out
of
school
yet
eventually
graduated
with
honors
or
a
family
member
who
failed
to
launch
a
business
only
to
eventually
achieve
success
with
their
second
venture
the
common
denominator
is
often
resilience
if
one
aspires
to
success
then
it
is
important
to
consider
one
s
own
relationship
to
failure
this

equally
within

we
have
stories

born
into
a
politically
influential
family
with
a
seemingly
predestined
career
in
politics
making
his
eventual
failure
less
surprising
served
in

where
he
was
a
failure
and
suffered
defeats
in
politics
but
despite
the
discouragement
applied
his
courage
and
press
making
my
own
decisions
has
proven
to
be
an
incredibly
beneficial
choice
in
my
life
taking
control
of
my
decisions
has
allowed
me
to
learn
and
grow
far
more
than
any
external
expert
or
authority
ever
could
for
example
when
i
was
deciding
what
college
to
attend
i
chose
to
ignore
the
advice
of
my
high
school
guidance
counselor
and
followed
my
own
instincts
i
did
my
own
research
and
compared
the
various
programs
available
to
me
ultimately
choosing
a
college
that
was
different
from
the
one
recommended
to
me
this
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
explore
and
learn
independently
expanding
my
knowledge
well
beyond
the
preconceived
ideas
of
a
single
person
another
example
of
why
it
s
best
to
make
my
own
decisions
can
be
found
in
my
career
rather
than
trying
to
follow
a
predetermined
path
proposed
by
someone
else
i
chose
to
make
my
own
decisions
about
what
job
i
wanted
this
enabled
me
to
explore
opportunities
that
i
otherwise
wouldn
t
have
been
aware
of
and
ultimately
led
me
to
a
field
that
i
am
passionate
about
and
enjoy
working
in
finally
when
it
comes
to
important
life
decisions
i
prefer
to
make
my
own
decisions
rather
than
following
the
advice
of
authority
figures
for
instance
when
it
comes
to
matters
of
health
and
wellbeing
i
like
to
do
my
own
research
and
make
decisions
that
are
based
on
my
own
understanding
of
my
body
and
needs
this
allows
me
to
make
choices
that
are
best
suited
for
my
individual
circumstances
and
beliefs
in
conclusion
it
is
far
better
to
make
your
own
decisions
in
life
rather
than
seeking
guidance
from
experts
or
authorities
making
my
own
decisions
has
allowed
me
to
learn
grow
and
make
choices
that
reflect
my
personal
beliefs
and
individual
needs
one
of
my
most
remarkable
talents
i
have
developed
over
the
years
is
my
ability
to
write
since
i
was
a
child
i
have
expressed
my
creativity
through
the
written
word
i
have
always
been
an
avid
reader
and
my
love
for
literature
inspired
me
to
explore
the
power
of
written
expression
i
have
developed
my
writing
skills
mainly
through
practice
and
dedication
i
have
had
many
amazing
teachers
who
aided
me
in
my
journey
from
reading
classical
works
to
understanding
the
importance
of
grammar
i
have
benefited
greatly
from
their
guidance
this
has
shaped
my
writing
style
and
equipped
me
with
the
necessary
tools
to
express
my
ideas
accurately
aside
from
my
teachers
some
of
my
closest
friends
also
have
influenced
the
way
i
write
i
value
their
feedback
and
opinion
when
it
comes
to
my
work
and
they
have
pushed
me
to
improve
by
inspiring
me
to
write
in
a
way
that
encourages
people
to
think
critically
overall
i
am
proud
that
i
have
used
my
passion
to
cultivate
a
unique
skill
over
the
years
with
the
help
of
my
teachers
and
friends
i
have
built
upon
the
foundations
of
my
writing
abilities
and
refined
my
craft
now
i
can
create
pieces
that
allow
a
wide
range
of
people
to
look
at
a
situation
from
a
different
perspective
having
the
right
guidance
to
make
the
right
decisions
in
life
is
essential
from
our
parents
helping
us
to
make
the
right
choice
in
school
to
highly qualified
professionals
aiding
us
in
our
careers
it
is
important
to
look
out
for
experts
and
authorities
who
can
help
us
make
the
most
of
our
lives
taking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
have
many
potential
benefits
firstly
the
knowledge
they
possess
can
give
us
the
insight
and
understanding
we
need
to
make
informed
decisions
for
our
future
those
decisions
can
be
tailored
to
fit
our
individual
tastes
situation
and
aspirations
being
advised
by
an
expert
means
that
our
decisions
can
be
based
on
far
more
than
mere
guesswork
an
example
of
this
can
be
seen
in
my
own
educational
career
when
deciding
which
university
to
attend
not
only
did
my
parents
provide
me
with
direction
and
advice
but
our
local
family
doctor
who
had
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
academic
programs
offered
in
our
area
gave
me
invaluable
guidance
i
ultimately
chose
a
major
and
institution
that
was
in
line
with
my
interests
and
goals
looking
back
it
is
clear
that
having
access
to
credible
advice
and
guidance
of
this
kind
was
instrumental
in
me
being
where
i
am
today
in
conclusion
taking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
in
life
s
important
matters
has
vast
potential
benefits
from
allowing
us
to
make
informed
choices
to
giving
us
an
extra
level
of
support
the
advantages
of
doing
so
can
not
be
understated
distance
learning
has
some
notable
drawbacks
compared
to
traditional
classroom based
instruction
for
example
distance
learning
may
not
allow
for
face to face
interaction
making
it
difficult
for
teachers
to
provide
feedback
and
support
distance
learning
can
also
be
less
engaging
for
students
as
it
can
lack
the
competition
and
collaboration
seen
in
traditional
classrooms
studies
have
found
that
interpersonal
interactions
between
teachers
and
students
are
important
for
learning
competition
and
inspiration
from
teachers
can
all
have
a
positive
impact
on
student
performance
and
engagement
teachers
can
provide
students
one on one
feedback
to
address
areas
of
difficulty
or
confusion
as
well
as
praise
for
a
job
well
done
the
presence
of
peers
in
the
classroom
creates
an
atmosphere
of
competition
that
encourages
students
to
work
harder
finally
teachers
can
serve
as
a
model
of
success
and
inspire
students
to
reach
their
goals
while
online
courses
do
offer
a
more
flexible
learning
option
they
can
not
replicate
the
communication
competition
and
inspiration
of
a
traditional
classroom
interaction
with
peers
is
limited
and
feedback
from
teachers
can
be
delayed
or
difficult
to
understand
furthermore
there
may
be
less
motivation
to
succeed
as
there
is
no
sense
of
competition
attending
classes
in
person
is
an
invaluable
educational
experience
that
offers
communication
competition
and
inspiration
from
teachers
that
distance
learning
can
not
traditional
classrooms
provide
students
with
the
guidance
and
support
they
need
to
be
successful
as
well
as
an
engaging
learning
environment
that
promotes
engagement
and
independent
learning
after
careful
consideration
of
the
topic
it
is
clear
that
there
are
valid
benefits
to
both
working
alone
and
working
with
a
group
working
alone
has
the
advantage
of
allowing
an
individual
to
work
at
their
own
pace
and
without
having
to
answer
to
or
coordinate
with
other
people
additionally
research
has
shown
that
people
who
are
typically
given
more
autonomy
and
decision making
power
over
their
own
work
tend
to
perform
better
and
have
more
productive
results
similarly
working
with
a
group
also
has
its
advantages
as
it
offers
the
opportunity
to
work
collaboratively
with
others
to
achieve
a
common
goal
working
with
a
group
also
allows
an
opportunity
to
brainstorm
divide
tasks
and
have
built in
accountability
partners
research
conducted
by
found
that
companies
that
promote
collaboration
within
their
teams
achieved
higher
success
and
out performed
other
organizations
who
relied
primarily
on
individual
work
in
conclusion
both
working
alone
and
working
in
a
group
offer
unique
advantages
depending
on
the
individual
or
the
nature
of
the
task
one
method
may
be
more
advantageous
than
the
other
however
the
most
successful
teams
often
combine
both
methods
to
capitalize
on
the
strengths
of
both
research
has
shown
that
having
shorter
school
time
for
students
can
offer
a
number
of
physical
emotional
and
developmental
benefits
among
these
are
increased
cognitive
function
improved
physical
health
and
a
greater
sense
of
happiness
and
well being
however
some
opponents
claim
that
having
shorter
school
time
will
be
detrimental
to
students
in
the
long
run
resulting
in
less
time
spent
engaged
in
meaningful
educational
activities
while
this
is
a
point
worth
considering
it
is
important
to
remember
that
students
who
receive
shorter
school
time
are
less
likely
to
suffer
from
the
effects
of
burnout
and
fatigue
allowing
them
to
focus
more
effectively
and
enjoy
a
healthier
work life
balance
in
recent
years
celebrities
such
as
have
gained
recognition
for
their
similar
educational
paths
while
s
lack
of
formal
education
may
have
had
its
advantages
such
as
the
freedom
to
focus
on
his
music
career
it
also
has
its
drawbacks
the
lack
of
traditional
education
may
have
hindered
depth
of
knowledge
in
certain
areas
and
made
the
development
of
a
well rounded
professional
skillset
more
difficult
having
shorter
school
time
is
important
to
ensure
students
are
given
the
time
and
space
to
flourish
both
academically
and
socially
particularly
in
an
era
when
academic
pressure
is
at
an
all time
high
as
students
are
inundated
with
extracurricular
activities
and
overwhelming
expectations
it
is
essential
that
their
academic
learning
should
not
be
hindered
by
undue
pressures
having
shorter
school
time
to
ensure
adequate
rest
and
recovery
is
the
best
way
to
guarantee
students
success
overall
shorter
school
time
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
each
student
s
educational
journey
is
just
and
equitable
when
it
comes
to
problem solving
there
is
no
substitute
for
doing
your
best
when
faced
with
a
difficult
situation
our
initial
reaction
is
often
to
give
up
and
accept
a
subpar
solution
but
by
refusing
to
accept
anything
less
than
our
best
effort
we
open
ourselves
up
to
possibilities
we
hadn
t
considered
take
for
instance
the
famous
story
of
s
invention
of
the
light
bulb
despite
failing
thousands
of
times
to
make
a
functioning
bulb
kept
pushing
himself
to
create
something
that
worked
his
relentless
dedication
paid
off
in
the
form
of
one
of
most
important
technological
inventions
in
history
it
s
a
remarkable
example
of
the
power
of
persistence
and
of
doing
your
best
to
solve
a
problem
no
matter
how
challenging
i
experienced
this
firsthand
when
i
was
applying
to
college
during
the
application
process
i
kept
running
into
roadblocks
it
felt
like
i
was
up
against
an
insurmountable
task
but
instead
of
giving
up
i
persevered
until
i
found
a
solution
my
willingness
to
put
in
the
effort
led
to
my
acceptance
into
the
college
of
my
dreams
ultimately
doing
your
best
to
solve
a
problem
is
the
only
way
to
produce
beneficial
results
with
determination
and
a
lot
of
hard
work
nearly
any
challenge
can
be
overcome
so
the
next
time
you
find
yourself
facing
an
obstacle
remember
to
stay
committed
and
never
stop
striving
for
the
best
in
summary
due
to
a
growing
awareness
of
students
academic
performance
and
the
increasing
necessity
for
them
to
reach
a
certain
level
of
academic
achievement
many
schools
have
implemented
policies
that
require
students
to
obtain
a
certain
grade
average
to
be
eligible
to
participate
in
sports
the
primary
benefit
of
these
policies
is
that
it
encourages
students
to
strive
for
higher
academic
achievement
while
in
school
as
grades
are
an
important
factor
both
in
eligibility
to
participate
in
sports
and
further
educational
opportunities
like
college
and
technical
training
furthermore
these
policies
also
encourage
students
to
prioritize
their
school
work
over
sports
reducing
the
potential
for
academic
neglect
at
the
same
time
however
there
are
significant
drawbacks
to
these
policies
lower income
students
students
with
as
a
second
language
or
students
with
learning
disabilities
or
other
special
needs
may
struggle
to
meet
these
standards
putting
them
at
a
significant
disadvantage
as
far
as
participation
in
school
sports
is
concerned
in
addition
some
have
criticized
the
policies
for
stigmatizing
students
who
don
t
reach
the
grade
average
creating
a
potentially
negative
atmosphere
in
the
school
technology
has
become
an
increasingly
integral
part
of
modern
life
it
brings
both
positive
and
negative
aspects
that
affect
our
lives
in
many
ways
on
the
one
hand
technology
has
revolutionized
communication
making
it
easier
to
stay
connected
with
friends
and
family
and
access
information
quickly
has
also
brought
about
many
advancements
in
medical
care
making
healthcare
more
accessible
and
improving
quality
of
life
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
be
limiting
with
so
much
information
available
it
can
be
difficult
to
know
what
is
accurate
and
reliable
it
can
also
lead
to
feelings
of
isolation
as
we
increasingly
rely
on
technology
to
interact
with
one
another
additionally
technology
can
cause
us
to
neglect
face to face
communication
exercise
and
other
social
and
personal
activities
technology
offers
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
that
should
be
taken
into
account
when
considering
its
influence
in
our
lives
technology
can
help
us
stay
connected
and
informed
but
it
can
also
cause
us
to
forget
about
the
importance
of
truly
engaging
with
our
environment
we
must
use
technology
mindfully
taking
its
advantages
while
limiting
its
harmful
effects
the
idea
of
adding
an
additional
minutes
to
the
school
day
has
a
few
obvious
drawbacks
for
students
it
means
that
they
would
have
to
arrive
to
school
earlier
and
stay
later
effectively
reducing
the
amount
of
time
spent
outside
of
school
this
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
after school
activities
such
as
sports
music
clubs
and
jobs
which
could
further
limit
opportunities
for
hands on
learning
and
socialization
on
the
other
hand
it
could
also
put
a
strain
on
students
who
already
lead
extremely
busy
lives
and
may
not
have
the
energy
to
stay
in
school
longer
each
day
from
the
perspective
of
teachers
the
increased
hours
could
create
additional
challenges
when
it
comes
to
maintaining
lesson
plans
grading
assignments
and
providing
individual
attention
in
addition
it
could
also
create
a
scheduling
conflict
for
teachers
who
work
outside
of
the
school
environment
for
parents
an
extra
minutes
in
the
school
day
could
significantly
increase
the
cost
of
their
child
s
education
and
may
even
disrupt
the
family
s
daily
schedule
it
could
also
mean
that
they
have
less
time
with
their
children
in
the
evenings
further
limiting
the
amount
of
parental
involvement
in
their
child
s
education
ultimately
adding
an
additional
minutes
to
the
school
day
could
have
a
wide
range
of
effects
for
students
teachers
and
parents
it
is
important
to
consider
each
individual
perspective
before
making
a
decision
on
this
issue
especially
since
it
could
have
lasting
implications
for
everyday
life
and
scheduling
being
oneself
is
an
extremely
important
part
of
life
as
it
is
the
only
way
to
truly
express
who
you
are
and
make
a
positive
impact
on
those
around
you
when
individuals
embrace
their
own
values
passions
dreams
and
goals
they
create
an
example
for
others
to
follow
and
an
inspiration
for
change
being
yourself
can
show
others
that
it
is
ok
to
be
unique
and
different
from
the
status
quo
and
to
be
proud
of
their
individuality
one
positive
effect
of
being
yourself
is
that
it
can
create
connections
with
people
for
example
if
you
share
your
own
passions
and
dreams
with
others
others
may
be
inspired
by
your
drive
and
commitment
this
connection
can
lead
to
collaboration
on
projects
and
help
create
opportunities
in
the
community
by
forging
these
connections
individuals
can
create
a
strong
support
system
where
everyone
can
be
open
and
honest
with
each
other
another
positive
effect
of
being
yourself
is
that
it
can
help
create
positive
change
in
the
world
by
being
yourself
and
embodying
certain
values
you
can
show
others
that
it
is
possible
to
make
a
difference
this
can
raise
awareness
of
social
issues
and
problems
and
can
mobilize
positive
action
for
change
it
can
also
inspire
others
to
become
advocates
for
those
around
them
in
conclusion
being
yourself
is
an
essential
piece
of
life
and
can
lead
to
positive
change
in

it
is
important
to
embrace
your

and
use
it
to
uplift
those
around
you
recent
studies
have
shown
that
having
a
longer
winter
break
than
summer
poses
a
threat
to
students
ability
to
retain
information
this
is
because
of
the
physiological
impact
that
extended
vacations
have
on
the
brain
during
a
prolonged
break
the
brain
is
likely
to
forget
more
information
leading
to
fewer
opportunities
for
recall
experiences
during
a
long
vacation
can
affect
a
student
s
ability
to
pay
attention
in
class
leading
to
a
decreased
understanding
of
the
material
to
ensure
that
students
stay
on
top
of
their
studies
it
is
important
to
limit
the
length
of
vacations
and
create
regular
breaks
throughout
the
year
after
surveying
the
opinions
of
my
peers
i
have
found
that
the
majority
do
not
support
the
idea
of
adding
hours
to
the
school
day
however
they
do
agree
that
the
school
should
provide
more
resources
and
support
for
students
as
well
as
prioritize
mental
health
some
suggested
alternatives
that
i
gathered
from
my
peers
include
increasing
the
number
of
classes
with
fewer
students
implementing
more
activities
that
promote
equal
access
for
all
students
and
providing
more
student teacher
mentoring
opportunities
these
alternative
solutions
could
be
beneficial
to
the
student
body
and
could
benefit
the
school
in
the
long
run
i
have
presented
my
findings
to
the
school
s
administration
and
look
forward
to
seeing
how
they
respond
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
is
a
challenging
proposition
but
one
that
may
be
advantageous
for
some
students
for
those
with
certain
legal
statuses
who
are
eligible
to
qualify
it
can
be
an
excellent
opportunity
to
save
time
and
money
with
pre credit
courses
available
students
can
often
take
classes
that
will
count
towards
their
course
requirements
enabling
them
to
reduce
the
amount
of
classes
needed
to
graduate
however
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
this
option
financially
the
cost
of
taking
more
classes
can
quickly
add
up
leading
to
more
expenses
some
high
schools
may
not
offer
the
necessary
courses
needed
for
early
graduation
taking
this
route
requires
careful
consideration
before
making
a
decision
the
use
of
mobile
phones
in
classrooms
for
educational
purposes
is
a
topic
that
has
received
much
attention
in
recent
years
on
the
one
hand
proponents
of
the
use
of
phones
in
educational
settings
believe
that
they
can
help
facilitate
learning
for
instance
mobile
phones
can
help
teachers
easily
manage
class
assignments
store
student
grades
and
create
collaborative
learning
opportunities
on
the
other
hand
opponents
of
phones
in
classrooms
contend
that
they
can
negatively
affect
student
learning
by
becoming
a
distraction
and
monitor
students
academic
performance
some
major
arguments
against
having
students
use
their
phones
in
the
classroom
are
that
mobile
phones
can
significantly
reduce
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
academic
tasks
impede
students
ability
to
engage
with
course
material
and
reduce
students
respect
for
their
instructors
has
shown
that
the
mere
presence
of
mobile
phones
in
the
classroom
can
create
an
atmosphere
of
distraction
and
divert
attention
away
from
course
material
this
can
lead
to
decreased
grades
poor
test
performance
and
a
decrease
in
student teacher
interaction
furthermore
having
confidential
student
information
accessible
on
phones
can
reduce
student teacher
trust
and
engagement
in
the
learning
process
in
conclusion
allowing
phones
in
the
classroom
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
student
learning
phones
can
be
a
source
of
distraction
impede
the
ability
to
engage
in
academic
tasks
and
diminish
respect
from
student
to
teacher
while
phones
can
be
used
in
educational
settings
to
create
collaboration
opportunities
it
is
important
to
provide
students
with
guidelines
and
regulations
about
the
use
of
phones
in
the
classroom
in
order
to
ensure
that
phones
do
not
become
a
hindrance
to
student
learning
one
of
the
main
differences
between
completing
high
school
in
three
years
versus
four
is
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
reach
graduation
while
the
four
year
timeline
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
take
part
in
a
more
extensive
extracurricular
curriculum
such
as
more
elective
classes
sports
and
school
clubs
graduating
in
three
years
can
provide
a
chance
to
speed
up
the
process
and
get
a
head
start
on
college
or
a
career
however
going
through
high
school
in
three
years
can
be
more
stressful
and
demanding
for
the
student
as
more
courses
will
need
to
be
taken
in
the
same
amount
of
time
while
still
leaving
time
for
homework
and
studying
in
addition
there
is
less
time
available
to
form
relationships
with
classmates
participate
in
extracurriculars
and
develop
other
important
social
skills
ultimately
it
s
up
to
the
student
to
decide
which
timeline
suits
their
educational
goals
best
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
may
provide
a
head
start
but
it
also
requires
a
great
deal
of
discipline
and
hard
work
on
the
other
hand
taking
four
years
to
finish
allows
for
a
less
stressful
academic
load
as
well
as
more
time
to
participate
in
extracurriculars
and
develop
important
social
skills
in
order
to
accomplish
our
goals
it
is
essential
to
learn
the
skills
knowledge
and
information
necessary
for
success
one
of
the
most
popular
methods
for
learning
is
studying
by
committing
information
to
memory
which
helps
improve
focus
and
make
sure
the
information
is
retained
additionally
gaining
experience
through
hands on
activities
can
be
more
efficient
and
effective
than
purely
memorizing
facts
and
theories
watching
demonstrations
engaging
with
peers
and
working
through
exercises
are
all
great
ways
to
learn
what
is
important
furthermore
leveraging
the
knowledge
of
experts
or
looking
for
examples
of
successful
people
in
the
same
field
can
be
very
informative
all
of
these
methods
can
be
used
to
obtain
the
goals
we
set
for
ourselves
making
decisions
for
ourselves
is
an
invaluable
part
of
life
it
not
only
helps
steer
us
in
the
right
direction
as
an
individual
but
also
allows
us
to
have
more
freedom
and
independence
however
making
our
own
decisions
can
also
have
its
drawbacks
one
example
is
found
in
the
story
of
relied
heavily
on
someone
else
to
make
decisions
for
them
and
in
the
end
faced
dire
consequences
this
example
serves
to
show
that
when
we
depend
on
someone
else
to
make
decisions
for
us
we
can
be
taking
away
the
chance
to
make
our
own
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
without
having
a
role
model
in
life
it
can
be
difficult
to
find
success
having
a
mentor
that
we
can
look
up
to
and
depend
on
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
but
it
also
important
to
trust
in
our
own
judgment
and
rely
on
ourselves
when
making
decisions
when
we
make
decisions
based
on
our
own
principles
and
ideals
it
gives
us
the
chance
to
live
and
experience
life
in
our
own
terms
rather
than
letting
other
peoples
opinions
take
precedence
ultimately
we
have
to
understand
that
we
can
not
live
life
under
someone
else
s
rule
our
entire
life
and
make
decisions
that
are
in
our
own
best
interest
the
extended
summer
break
provides
students
with
a
much
needed
respite
from
challenging
studies
and
the
rigors
of
a
school
year
comparing
the
length
of
the
school
year
with
the
length
of
summer
break
it
is
clear
that
the
break
is
plenty
long
enough
for
students
to
relax
recharge
and
take
a
break
from
school
however
should
this
extended
break
be
extended
to
other
seasons
such
as
fall
winter
and
spring
there
are
potential
problems
that
could
compound
matters
holidays
celebrated
in
those
seasons
would
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
the
extended
break
and
the
school
year
would
have
to
be
altered
from
the
current
format
moreover
giving
students
extra
breaks
during
the
year
would
further
disrupt
their
academic
pattern
and
their
performance
in
a
curriculum
compromising
their
academic
progress
is
more
important
than
imagination
for
a
variety
of
reasons
for
starters
knowledge
is
based
on
facts
and
evidence
while
imagination
can
be
more
subjective
and
open
to
interpretation
is
also
tangible
and
constantly
evolving
whereas
imagination
is
often
grounded
in
ideas
or
beliefs
that
may
not
necessarily
be
relevant
or
even
accurate
moreover
knowledge
can
be
used
to
solve
problems
draw
conclusions
and
make
informed
decisions
whereas
imagination
often
seeks
to
make
unpredictable
connections
and
explore
what if
scenarios
in
addition
knowledge
provides
us
with
a
strong
foundation
to
experiment
with
ideas
whereas
imagination
is
often
limited
to
a
single
set
of
circumstances
investing
in
knowledge
over
imagination
pays
off
in
the
long
run
enabling
us
to
make
better
and
more
informed
decisions
as
the
global
warming
crisis
deepens
and
our
environment
suffers
it
has
brought
into
question
how
our
current
behavior
has
added
to
the
problem
and
posed
the
question
of
how
to
make
a
positive
difference
while
it
is
difficult
to
make
large scale
changes
we
can
effect
small
scale
self change
which
can
eventually
have
larger
impacts
on
the
environment
we
can
look
to
our
daily
lives
and
identify
small
changes
in
behavior
that
can
reduce
our
energy
use
and
our
reliance
on
electricity
this
can
come
in
the
form
of
reducing
our
dependence
on
technology
limiting
our
energy
usage
flat
rate
and
employing
renewable
energies
to
be
in
tune
with
the
environment
by
making
small
changes
in
our
own
lives
it
can
reinforce
the
importance
of
being
conscious
of
the
planet
and
create
hope
for
stakeholders
and
decision
makers
to
take
action
this
summer
i
had
the
privilege
of
visiting
a
small
village
in
although
i
had
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
a
variety
of
activities
while
there
one
of
the
most
memorable
experiences
was
learning
how
to
make
traditional
pottery
i
was
amazed
to
discover
how
much
time
hard
work
and
patience
goes
into
making
just
one
pot
i
was
equally
astonished
by
the
intricate
designs
the
potters
were
able
to
create
the
process
which
involved
mixing
clay
with
water
and
collecting
materials
from
the
local
environment
taught
me
the
value
of
craftsmanship
and
taking
pride
in
one
s
work
it
also
showed
me
that
even
with
so
few
resources
one
can
still
create
something
of
beauty
observing
the
dedication
of
the
potters
in
the
village
and
the
joy
in
their
faces
when
they
were
able
to
produce
a
successful
pot
taught
me
that
there
is
pleasure
in
working
carefully
and
patiently
and
that
you
don
t
have
to
be
wealthy
to
be
content
this
experience
has
certainly
changed
me
and
i
hope
to
take
this
lesson
with
me
wherever
life
takes
me
local
i
am
writing
to
express
my
strong
objections
to
the
proposal
of
changing
the
school
system
from
a
five day
to
a
four day
workweek
it
is
my
belief
that
this
will
prove
to
be
damaging
in
a
multitude
of
ways
firstly
the
lack
of
an
extra
day
will
drastically
cut
down
the
amount
of
time
in
the
day
for
students
to
do
their
work
test
their
skills
during
extracurricular
activities
and
participate
in
other
academic
engagements
making
it
nearly
impossible
for
them
to
establish
a
balance
between
leisurely
activities
and
extracurricular
activities
furthermore
the
truncated
amount
of
time
available
for
learning
and
growth
will
reduce
the
quality
of
education
that
the
students
witness
in
their
respective
disciplines
a
four day
school
week
will
also
cause
undue
stress
and
pressure
on
students
as
all
their
lessons
will
be
crammed
into
four
days
rather
than
five
making
it
hard
for
them
to
take
a
break
from
the
workload
additionally
with
the
three day
weekend
students
may
become
lethargic
and
unenthusiastic
in
learning
and
developing
skills
and
gradually
become
less
productive
this
year
s
final
exams
have
shown
us
how
the
five day
school
week
motivates
students
to
become
more
prepared
for
the
assessments
and
can
help
them
be
ready
for
the
future
without
this
extra
day
it
is
likely
that
student
achievement
will
go
down
for
all
these
reasons
i
urge
you
not
to
adopt
a
four day
work
week
and
to
maintain
the
five day
school
week
for
better
academic
achievements
and
continuity
sincerely
your
name
distance
education
is
without
a
doubt
a
great
opportunity
for
students
who
are
looking
for
an
alternative
to
traditional
learning
it
is
an
innovative
and
growing
form
of
education
that
can
provide
several
benefits
over
traditional
learning
there
are
many
reasons
why
distance
learning
can
be
a
good
option
rather
than
a
bad
one
for
students
who
are
being
bullied
at
school
distance
learning
can
provide
a
sense
of
security
and
peace
of
mind
it
allows
them
to
learn
in
a
safe
environment
and
enables
them
to
have
more
control
over
their
personal
schedule
so
they
can
study
on
their
own
time
without
fear
of
harassment
additionally
distance
learning
can
be
immensely
advantageous
for
students
who
for
whatever
reason
live
too
far
away
from
their
school
to
attend
regularly
it
gives
students
the
flexibility
to
work
from
anywhere
and
complete
their
course
work
on
their
own
time
moreover
students
should
consider
trying
distance
learning
as
it
may
offer
them
an
opportunity
to
pursue
their
educational
aspirations
and
goals
with
cost
efficiency
although
there
are
costs
associated
with
distance
learning
when
comparing
to
the
cost
of
attending
a
traditional
institution
it
may
be
less
expensive
in
the
long
run
in
conclusion
distance
learning
can
be
a
great
option
for
students
who
are
looking
for
an
alternative
and
cost effective
way
to
pursue
their
educational
goals
it
can
provide
safety
and
flexibility
to
those
who
are
being
bullied
and
those
who
have
limited
access
to
a
brick
and
mortar
school
with
the
variety
of
benefits
distance
learning
offers
it
s
worth
considering
as
a
viable
option
establishing
a
homework
club
can
provide
numerous
benefits
to
students
by
offering
a
dedicated
supportive
environment
where
students
can
come
together
to
complete
their
assignments
a
homework
club
can
help
create
a
sense
of
community
and
camaraderie
among
classmates
many
students
struggle
with
feeling
isolated
or
disconnected
in
large
school
settings
so
clubs
like
these
provide
an
opportunity
for
them
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
peers
additionally
the
presence
of
a
dedicated
space
for
studying
can
help
students
stay
focused
and
motivated
to
get
their
work
done
with
knowledgeable
facilitators
in
attendance
members
of
the
homework
club
can
also
seek
guidance
and
support
when
needed
ultimately
homework
clubs
can
help
equip
students
with
better
academic
skills
emotional
well being
and
social
skills
for
future
success
is
a
fundamental
part
of
any
healthy
relationship
in
the
context
of
family
and
friends
being
honest
can
aid
in
creating
a
comfortable
and
trusting
bond
as
the
saying
goes
honesty
is
the
best
policy
however
while
honesty
can
be
an
advantage
in
relationships
it
can
also
be
a
double edged
sword
on
the
one
hand
speaking
honestly
can
allow
family
and
friends
to
gain
a
clear
understanding
of
each
other
on
the
other
hand
it
can
at
times
lead
to
hurt
feelings
arguments
and
other
consequences
being
dishonest
or
lying
can
be
just
as
damaging
lying
can
lead
to
mistrust
both
in
the
present
and
in
the
future
it
can
cause
feelings
of
guilt
and
anxiety
making
communication
difficult
lying
can
be
especially
damaging
in
long term
relationships
as
people
come
to
doubt
the
validity
of
what
a
person
is
saying
or
doing
is
the
key
to
cultivating
and
maintaining
strong
relationships
by
speaking
honestly
and
openly
it
is
easier
for
family
and
friends
to
understand
each
other
and
to
be
more
connected
not
only
can
it
lead
to
respect
in
relationships
but
it
also
fosters
a
greater
sense
of
security
plus
the
longer
these
relationships
are
maintained
the
stronger
the
sense
of
trust
will
become
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
modern
living
and
it
is
difficult
to
ignore
the
multitude
of
ways
it
has
improved
our
lives
people
who
are
physically
limited
by
their
lack
of
mobility
speech
or
hearing
can
now
access
communication
information
and
services
without
the
limitations
of
a
physical
world
shopping
for
instance
provides
an
immense
convenience
that
wasn
t
available
before
buying
a
book
without
leaving
your
house
is
now
a
reality
technology
has
enabled
us
to
connect
with
people
from
around
the
world
allowing
us
to
communicate
with
near instantaneous
speed
although
technology
has
brought
about
great
strides
in
our
lives
it
is
important
to
consider
the
downsides
of
this
progression
with
more
communication
and
information
readily
available
the
value
of
human
contact
can
be
lessened
face to face
conversations
are
becoming
more
scarce
and
the
consequences
of
this
could
be
severe
it
is
important
to
learn
how
to
properly
utilize
technology
and
its
features
so
that
human
contact
and
communication
are
not
lost
ultimately
there
is
little
argument
against
the
fact
that
technology
has
had
an
overwhelmingly
positive
effect
on
both
our
personal
and
professional
lives
it
enables
us
to
communicate
across
long
distances
in
mere
seconds
and
has
made
the
world
feel
ever so slightly
smaller
however
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
danger
of
overreliance
and
remember
that
technology
is
a
resource
and
a
tool
one
that
should
be
used
intelligently
and
with
consideration
for
its
consequences
success
can
be
a
difficult
concept
to
define
and
even
more
difficult
to
achieve
while
some
argue
that
it
is
only
through
the
experience
of
numerous
failures
that
success
can
be
achieved
others
assert
that
success
can
be
achieved
even
without
the
hardships
of
numerous
failures
those
who
argue
that
success
depends
on
failure
cite
the
fact
that
failure
gives
opportunity
for
growth
and
insight
with
each
failure
we
come
to
understand
the
shortcomings
of
our
plans
and
can
make
improvements
to
find
ultimate
success
famously
said
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
wo
n t
work
this
exemplifies
how
failure
can
aid
us
on
our
path
to
success
on
the
other
hand
some
people
believe
that
success
can
be
obtained
without
failure
and
point
to
examples
of
those
who
found
success
without
making
any
serious
mistakes
they
argue
that
success
can
be
achieved
with
hard
work
dedication
and
perhaps
a
little
luck
in
my
opinion
true
success
is
a
combination
of
both
failure
and
success
without
failure
a
person
may
not
gain
the
necessary
experience
and
setback
needed
to
recognize
what
steps
need
to
be
taken
in
order
to
succeed
on
the
other
hand
sheer
hard
work
and
dedication
can
help
to
guide
us
in
the
right
direction
and
offer
support
for
our
efforts
to
reach
success
throughout
the
past
few
years
the
emergence
of
technology
has
opened
up
a
myriad
of
possibilities
for
student
success
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
with
the
introduction
of
cellphones
specifically
students
around
the
world
have
the
ability
to
utilize
their
devices
to
find
resources
complete
school
assignments
and
check
their
grades
whenever
and
wherever
they
may
be
as
a
result
allowing
cellphones
in
the
classroom
for
educational
purposes
has
had
a
number
of
positive
effects
on
both
student
achievement
and
the
learning
environment
and
foremost
allowing
cellphones
in
the
classroom
can
help
students
to
be
better
organized
and
complete
their
assignments
more
efficiently
for
instance
when
a
student
has
a
question
regarding
their
work
they
can
quickly
access
any
resources
available
online
for
more
in depth
information
moreover
in
regards
to
students
who
need
a
refresher
on
specific
material
they
could
easily
find
related
videos
articles
and
other
sources
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
their
assignments
in
addition
to
this
students
could
also
utilize
apps
to
help
manage
their
time
schedule
study
sessions
and
keep
their
work
organized
furthermore
allowing
cellphones
in
the
classroom
for
educational
purposes
can
also
help
students
feel
more
at
ease
in
their
learning
environment
with
their
devices
students
can
quickly
collaborate
with
peers
to
collaborate
on
projects
ask
for
help
when
needed
and
send
last
minute
reminders
as
a
result
students
do
not
have
to
worry
when
they
may
forget
something
or
have
a
question
about
an
assignment
furthermore
by
having
their
device
at
hand
students
can
easily
stay
focused
and
engaged
as
they
will
not
need
to
leave
the
classroom
to
find
resources
in
conclusion
there
are
many
positive
effects
of
allowing
students
to
use
their
cellphones
in
classrooms
for
educational
purposes
not
only
can
students
benefit
from
easy
access
to
online
resources
but
the
use
of
cellphones
in
the
classroom
can
also
help
students
better
manage
their
time
collaborate
more
efficiently
with
their
peers
and
feel
more
comfortable
and
engaged
while
learning
cellphones
are
a
pervasive
technology
in
our
lives
today
and
new
conversations
are
emerging
around
their
use
in
the
school
setting
on
one
hand
cellphones
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
learning
environment
by
providing
students
with
instant
access
to
information
the
ability
to
collaborate
with
their
peers
on
projects
and
tools
to
increase
their
organization
and
productivity
on
the
other
hand
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
for
cellphones
to
be
distracting
and
they
may
even
create
an
atmosphere
of
inequity
as
some
students
may
not
have
access
to
a
smartphone
or
reliable
internet
connection
in
order
to
limit
the
potential
negative
impact
of
cellphones
in
the
classroom
educators
can
adopt
strategies
such
as
setting
clear
expectations
providing
students
guidance
on
how
to
use
their
cellphones
in
an
appropriate
fashion
and
allowing
usage
only
for
certain
areas
of
the
curriculum
by
establishing
these
strategies
educators
can
head
off
potential
issues
that
might
arise
from
allowing
students
access
to
their
cellphones
while
in
class
nobody
can
deny
that
growth
is
a
necessary
element
in
our
human
experience
which
can
affect
both
our
personal
and
professional
lives
the
quote
unless
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
is
a
great
reminder
of
how
important
it
is
to
step
out
of
our
comfort
zone
and
take
risks
in
order
to
progress
the
greatest
accomplishments
of
humanity
have
come
as
a
result
of
pushing
our
boundaries
and
trying
to
do
something
new
and
challenging
from
inventing
the
telephone
to
landing
on
the
moon
to
creating
revolutionary
medical
treatments
every
groundbreaking
development
can
be
traced
back
to
a
group
of
people
who
decided
to
move
outside
of
their
established
skills
and
take
a
chance
even
today
entrepreneurs
and
innovators
rely
on
creative
and
ambitious
risk taking
in
order
to
create
businesses
products
and
services
that
solve
problems
and
advance
society
additionally
there
are
countless
personal
success
stories
of
people
who
took
the
step
to
try
something
new
and
it
changed
their
lives
from
someone
who
learned
a
new
language
to
someone
who
changed
careers
to
someone
who
tried
a
completely
different
hobby
each
of
these
individuals
had
to
accept
a
challenge
outside
of
their
existing
knowledge
before
they
could
experience
personal
growth
most
of
us
can
look
at
our
own
lives
and
recognize
the
same
kind
of
successes
be
it
large
or
small
that
have
come
from
pushing
ourselves
to
do
something
beyond
our
current
level
in
conclusion
this
quote
succinctly
captures
the
vital
role
that
striving
to
accomplish
something
new
and
challenging
plays
in
our
growth
it
is
only
when
we
are
willing
to
take
risks
and
learn
new
things
that
we
can
truly
expand
our
capabilities
and
reach
new
heights
distance
learning
has
become
a
popular
option
for
many
students
and
with
it
certain
risks
and
benefits
arise
while
remote
learning
can
offer
an
accessible
and
flexible
learning
experience
it
can
also
have
adverse
effects
on
student
attendance
and
cheating
when
it
comes
to
attendance
many
students
may
find
themselves
less
inclined
to
actively
participate
in
classes
due
to
lack
of
in person
interaction
this
can
result
in
low
levels
of
engagement
and
may
lead
to
poor
learning
outcomes
furthermore
there
is
an
increased
possibility
that
students
may
cheat
on
tests
or
quizzes
when
not
supervised
by
teachers
to
counteract
this
teachers
must
find
innovative
solutions
to
ensure
that
students
do
not
take
advantage
of
online
learning
learning
can
also
have
an
impact
on
teachers
jobs
as
they
may
feel
overworked
or
lack
the
freedom
to
instruct
classes
in
their
usual
manner
however
when
adapted
properly
remote
learning
can
be
an
effective
method
of
teaching
that
can
benefit
both
teachers
and
students
the
potential
of
students
dropping
out
of
school
while
learning
from
home
is
also
a
concern
without
regular
attendance
or
in person
supervision
more
students
may
remain
long term
absent
from
school
impeding
their
learning
progress
governance
must
be
implemented
to
ensure
distance
learning
is
effective
but
not
abused
all
in
all
while
there
are
risk
associated
with
distance
learning
there
are
also
many
positive
aspects
such
as
enhanced
access
to
education
for
students
who
may
otherwise
struggle
to
attend
school
with
the
right
strategies
in
place
distance
learning
can
be
a
safe
and
beneficial
educational
system
since
the
dawn
of
time
people
have
realized
the
immense
benefits
of
helping
others
by
participating
in
community
service
students
gain
valuable
skills
and
learn
more
about
their
community
but
some
argue
that
this
should
not
be
a
requirement
for
students
stating
that
it
is
too
much
work
on
the
one
hand
community
service
is
a
good
way
for
students
to
develop
important
skills
such
as
communication
problem
solving
and
collaboration
it
can
also
lead
to
improved
student
engagement
and
higher
success
levels
since
students
are
actively
involved
in
their
community
moreover
service
activities
provide
a
great
way
to
learn
more
about
the
world
around
them
and
how
they
can
make
a
difference
on
the
other
hand
opponents
to
mandatory
community
service
argue
that
it
is
a
burden
for
students
taking
away
valuable
time
that
could
be
spent
studying
or
doing
other
activities
additionally
it
can
be
a
challenge
for
students
to
find
community
service
opportunities
that
align
with
their
interests
and
that
provide
meaningful
experiences
ultimately
i
believe
that
requiring
students
to
participate
in
community
service
can
be
beneficial
not
only
teaching
students
valuable
skills
but
also
providing
them
with
an
opportunity
to
make
a
positive
impact
on
their
community
by
mandating
community
service
students
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
their
local
community
in
meaningful
ways
when
employers
are
looking
for
potential
employees
they
often
look
for
qualities
associated
with
responsibility
and
hard
work
i
have
always
strived
to
be
a
responsible
person
and
i
have
several
examples
of
how
i
have
accomplished
this
for
example
i
always
complete
my
tasks
accurately
and
thoroughly
and
i
try
to
stay
organized
by
using
to do
lists
and
project
timelines
by
showing
employers
how
responsible
i
am
with
my
own
work
i
can
prove
that
i
can
be
trusted
and
that
i
value
hard
work
in
addition
i
have
also
gained
valuable
experience
through
volunteering
in
various
positions
these
volunteer
experiences
have
taught
me
invaluable
lessons
in
time
management
multitasking
and
problem solving
through
developing
these
skills
i
have
been
able
to
increase
my
efficiency
so
i
can
complete
tasks
quickly
and
effectively
finally
it
s
easy
to
take
for
granted
how
important
it
is
to
be
a
hard worker
as
opposed
to
a
lazy
one
a
lazy
person
may
appear
unmotivated
and
may
take
shortcuts
on
work
while
a
hard worker
will
go
the
extra
mile
a
hard worker
will
also
be
seen
as
a
reliable
and
trustworthy
individual
characteristics
that
can
make
them
highly
desirable
to
employers
eating
healthier
food
in
school
cafeterias
can
have
a
range
of
beneficial
impacts
for
students
firstly
it
can
provide
students
with
nutritious
and
quality
meals
as
part
of
their
daily
diet
providing
the
vitamins
and
minerals
needed
for
physical
and
mental
health
secondly
having
access
to
healthier
food
options
can
encourage
students
to
make
positive
lifestyle
changes
that
can
have
long term
health
benefits
such
as
reduced
rates
of
obesity
high
blood
pressure
and
diabetes
on
the
other
hand
obesity
has
a
number
of
negative
impacts
both
physical
and
psychological
on
the
health
of
individuals
and
communities
physically
obesity
can
lead
to
a
range
of
health
issues
such
as
heart
disease
stroke
and
arthritis
obesity
can
cause
low
self esteem
and
can
lead
to
issues
such
as
depression
and
anxiety
in
addition
obesity
can
often
lead
to
financial
costs
which
can
be
difficult
to
bear
for
families
and
schools
in
conclusion
encouraging
students
to
choose
healthier
food
options
through
the
school
cafeteria
can
have
a
number
of
positive
impacts
for
their
overall
health
and
wellbeing
while
at
the
same
time
reducing
the
negative
impacts
of
obesity
having
a
positive
attitude
is
a
key
factor
in
success
and
happiness
numerous
studies
have
shown
that
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
physical
and
emotional
health
people
with
a
positive
attitude
are
generally
more
resilient
and
successful
when
it
comes
to
overcoming
challenges
and
achieving
their
goals
for
example
british
writer
was
famously
able
to
take
her
struggles
in
early
adulthood
and
use
them
as
fuel
to
write
her
iconic
series
she
was
able
to
foster
a
positive
attitude
and
use
it
to
her
advantage
becoming
one
of
the
world
s
wealthiest
and
most
successful
authors
in
the
process
no
matter
the
hardship
staying
positive
can
be
a
challenge
it
can
be
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
especially
during
difficult
times
but
it
is
important
to
keep
our
outlook
positive
as
it
can
help
us
push
forward
and
find
success
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
important
factor
in
achieving
happiness
and
success
it
encourages
resilience
encourages
us
to
take
on
difficult
challenges
and
can
help
us
make
the
most
out
of
our
difficulties
and
experiences
assigning
electives
to
high
school
students
can
indeed
be
a
powerful
tool
for
improving
student
motivation
attendance
and
grades
as
students
get
to
select
courses
of
interest
to
them
they
could
become
more
passionate
about
attending
school
and
engaged
in
the
learning
process
this
could
result
in
improved
academic
outcomes
however
one
potential
drawback
is
that
it
may
be
difficult
for
students
to
make
the
most
suitable
choices
for
an
elective
as
a
result
they
might
end
up
taking
a
course
that
does
not
keep
their
interest
for
long
or
does
not
match
their
level
of
skills
in
addition
it
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
a
better
understanding
and
appreciation
of
the
arts
as
the
student
might
become
too
focused
on
scoring
good
grades
in
the
course
instead
of
taking
a
more
holistic
approach
an
alternative
approach
that
could
help
high
school
students
better
understand
and
appreciate
the
arts
could
be
to
provide
an
interdisciplinary
approach
to
the
learning
experience
this
could
involve
teaching
students
the
history
theory
and
context
of
the
arts
as
well
as
introducing
them
to
activities
such
as
painting
music
dance
theatre
among
others
during
the
darkest
times
a
positive
attitude
can
be
the
light
that
leads
the
way
a
recent
example
that
stands
out
is
the
story
of
my
grandmother
despite
her
own
health
battle
she
maintained
an
unwavering
brightness
that
buoyed
our
family
and
us
every
day
she
shared
a
joke
or
a
funny
story
her
attitude
as
resilient
as
ever
from
her
example
i
learned
the
importance
of
having
a
positive
attitude
even
during
difficult
times
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
important
part
of
managing
difficult
times
as
it
fosters
resilience
and
strength
it
can
be
a
great
source
of
moral
support
during
difficult
situations
and
can
even
help
bring
about
concrete
solutions
to
existing
problem
other
benefits
include
better
self care
and
enhanced
mental
health
supporting
a
loved
one
during
a
difficult
time
requires
an
understanding
of
their
individual
needs
one
way
to
do
this
is
to
actively
listen
and
provide
a
shoulder
to
lean
on
as
they
process
their
emotions
other
ideas
include
providing
helpful
advice
if
appropriate
or
helping
them
find
additional
resources
such
as
therapy
or
support
groups
if
needed
at
the
end
of
the
day
having
a
positive
attitude
during
a
difficult
time
is
not
easy
but
is
invaluable
it
can
help
an
individual
continue
to
have
faith
in
their
journey
even
in
the
darkness
it
is
a
reminder
that
brighter
days
will
be
ahead
and
it
is
a
reminder
to
be
kind
to
oneself
taking
classes
from
home
has
become
a
popular
choice
for
many
students
who
are
looking
for
more
flexible
options
for
their
learning
on
the
one
hand
students
taking
classes
at
home
can
enjoy
the
benefits
of
being
able
to
set
their
own
schedule
and
being
able
to
work
at
their
own
pace
they
can
access
resources
more
easily
as
many
online
courses
provide
access
to
academic
materials
and
other
resources
additionally
online
courses
have
lower
tuition
and
provide
an
easier
learning
process
however
there
are
drawbacks
to
taking
courses
at
home
as
well
students
may
not
get
the
same
support
they
would
find
in
a
school
setting
such
as
one on one
help
from
the
professor
or
access
to
tutoring
resources
additionally
online
courses
require
more
self discipline
and
can
be
more
difficult
for
students
who
learn
better
in
a
traditional
classroom
setting
taking
classes
from
home
can
also
lead
to
feeling
isolated
from
classmates
which
can
make
it
more
difficult
to
engage
with
the
material
overall
there
are
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
taking
classes
at
home
versus
in
school
it
is
important
for
students
to
weigh
their
options
when
considering
which
route
to
take
that
way
they
can
find
the
learning
path
that
best
suits
their
needs
in
recent
years
the
debate
between
home
schooling
versus
attending
a
traditional
school
has
become
increasingly
prevalent
both
methods
of
education
have
their
own
unique
advantages
and
choosing
which
one
is
right
for
your
specific
situation
can
be
a
difficult
decision
so
what
exactly
are
the
benefits
of
home
schooling
when
compared
to
traditional
schooling
one
of
the
most
obvious
benefits
of
home
schooling
is
customization
parents
who
choose
this
option
are
able
to
tailor
their
children
s
curriculum
to
fit
their
individual
needs
and
abilities
schooling
allows
parents
to
build
a
lesson
plan
that
caters
to
not
only
their
child
s
strengths
but
also
focuses
on
areas
that
their
child
needs
help
with
home
schooling
allows
parents
to
accommodate
their
children
s
unique
interests
and
provide
advanced
instruction
in
topics
of
their
interest
another
major
benefit
of
home
schooling
is
the
freedom
for
learners
to
work
at
their
own
pace
while
in
traditional
school
classrooms
teachers
are
limited
to
an
average
set
pace
that
does
not
cater
to
students
with
different
learning
styles
however
home
schooling
allows
students
to
slow
down
and
take
their
time
in
understanding
a
concept
or
to
skip
ahead
if
they
already
possess
any
prior
knowledge
home
schooling
provides
learners
with
a
more
flexible
schedule
and
the
option
to
structure
learning
around
other
activities
schooling
gives
students
the
freedom
to
decide
when
and
where
they
want
to
work
making
it
easier
for
them
to
choose
hands on
and
out of the classroom
activities
although
both
traditional
school
and
home
schooling
have
their
advantages
those
who
opt
for
home
schooling
are
able
to
take
advantage
of
more
individualized
and
flexible
instruction
schooling
allows
learners
the
freedom
to
customize
their
own
unique
learning
experience
and
create
a
more
personalized
educational
setting
for
many
students
staying
two
extra
hours
in
school
is
a
challenge
having
an
extra
two
hours
tacked
onto
the
regular
school
day
puts
an
undue
burden
on
students
who
may
already
be
lacking
in
energy
or
time
having
a
full
day
of
school
can
take
a
toll
on
students
physical
and
mental
energy
and
asking
them
to
stay
two
additional
hours
with
limited
resources
can
be
overwhelming
for
instance
students
who
are
already
feeling
overwhelmed
by
academic
tasks
may
reach
a
breaking
point
when
faced
with
the
option
of
staying
for
an
additional
two
hours
of
school
while
it
may
not
seem
like
much
time
it
can
be
the
tipping
point
between
feeling
exhausted
and
feeling
overwhelmed
moreover
staying
an
extra
two
hours
in
school
can
also
make
it
more
difficult
for
those
with
after school
commitments
to
honor
outside
obligations
or
just
spend
time
with
family
the
lack
of
time
and
energy
can
also
have
a
psychological
effect
on
students
if
they
are
not
able
to
stay
the
extra
two
hours
they
may
feel
a
sense
of
guilt
or
disappointment
it
can
be
emotionally
challenging
for
students
to
leave
school
in
the
middle
of
a
lesson
and
feel
like
they
are
letting
both
themselves
and
the
teacher
down
in
conclusion
staying
an
extra
two
hours
in
school
can
be
an
incredibly
stressful
experience
for
students
who
may
already
be
feeling
overwhelmed
or
struggling
to
manage
their
time
and
energy
not
being
able
to
stay
for
those
extra
two
hours
can
have
both
physical
and
psychological
consequences
it
s
important
to
remember
that
everyone
copes
in
different
ways
and
we
must
take
into
account
students
individual
needs
before
making
decisions
about
the
length
of
the
school
day
after
a
great
deal
of
research
into
different
career
paths
i
have
compiled
a
list
of
possible
options
that
interest
me
i
have
decided
to
pursue
a
career
in
software
engineering
and
am
researching
the
necessary
skills
and
qualifications
to
make
this
possible
i
have
found
the
best
option
to
achieve
my
goals
is
attending
a
college
which
provides
a
software
engineering
degree
the
college
offers
a
diverse
curriculum
that
will
prepare
me
with
the
knowledge
and
expertise
necessary
to
become
successful
in
this
field
recent
studies
have
revealed
that
the
implementation
of
a
four day
work
week
can
increase
productivity
among
workers
reduce
employee
turnover
and
boost
morale
however
it
is
becoming
increasingly
clear
that
such
a
transition
to
a
four day
school
week
would
bring
unpredictable
impacts
on
student
academic
performance
and
wellbeing
without
sufficient
time
allotted
to
education
schools
would
be
forced
to
use
modern
technologies
to
replace
the
lessons
and
activities
traditionally
conducted
throughout
a
five day
school
schedule
the
potential
outcomes
of
such
a
change
greatly
depend
on
the
capability
of
technologies
to
integrate
into
the
learning
experience
without
negatively
affecting
the
quality
of
education
though
a
four day
school
week
presents
a
unique
opportunity
to
students
by
giving
them
an
extended
weekend
there
could
be
risks
such
as
loss
of
important
material
due
to
a
compressed
learning
environment
at
the
same
time
final
exams
and
long term
projects
could
be
challenging
due
to
having
only
four
days
to
complete
them
and
a
sudden
change
in
routine
could
pose
a
barrier
to
academic
success
ultimately
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
five day
school
week
need
to
be
compared
with
those
of
a
four day
school
week
to
determine
which
is
the
most
suitable
for
students
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
there
are
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
both
working
with
a
group
and
working
alone
working
in
a
group
can
bring
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
have
multiple
different
perspectives
and
ideas
on
how
to
tackle
an
issue
this
can
allow
for
more
thorough
and
innovative
solutions
and
greater
success
overall
however
working
in
a
group
also
tends
to
require
more
coordination
and
can
lead
to
frustrations
due
to
differing
opinions
and
differences
in
work
styles
working
alone
can
be
beneficial
in
that
it
allows
for
uninterrupted
focus
and
the
ability
to
progress
quickly
working
by
yourself
also
requires
fewer
resources
and
can
lead
to
achievements
faster
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
can
mean
less
creative
input
and
ideas
as
well
as
little
to
no
external
feedback
when
deciding
whether
to
work
alone
or
in
a
group
the
focus
should
be
on
what
the
individual
task
or
project
requires
in
terms
of
creative
input
feedback
resources
and
time
constraints
if
more
perspectives
are
needed
to
achieve
success
then
working
in
a
group
may
be
the
best
choice
if
quick
results
are
desired
then
working
alone
may
be
the
better
option
putting
in
determination
and
effort
are
key
to
achieving
any
goal
no
matter
how
big
or
small
the
goal
may
be
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
advantages
of
dedication
and
hard
work
with
commitment
and
effort
whatever
we
set
our
minds
to
can
be
accomplished
gives
us
the
strength
to
work
through
obstacles
and
to
keep
striving
even
if
results
are
not
seen
immediately
it
s
a
form
of
resilience
that
enables
us
to
keep
moving
forward
no
matter
how
difficult
things
might
seem
having
effort
gives
us
the
energy
to
make
progress
through
our
goals
while
providing
a
sense
of
achievement
with
both
determination
and
effort
we
can
set
and
reach
goals
that
we
once
thought
were
impossible
the
impact
of
technology
on
people
s
lives
is
complicated
on
one
hand
technology
has
allowed
people
to
connect
with
others
in
ways
never
before
possible
allowing
us
to
stay
in
touch
with
close
friends
or
family
members
even
if
they
are
far
away
additionally
buying
items
online
has
connected
people
to
lucrative
deals
they
otherwise
would
n t
have
access
to
and
allowed
them
to
make
efficient
timely
purchases
on
the
other
hand
technology
has
created
a
divide
between
people
and
their
relationships
technology
has
become
a
replacement
for
physical
contact
and
has
made
it
harder
for
people
to
meet
and
form
strong
relationships
with
each
other
leading
to
social
isolation
moreover
parents
often
worry
about
their
children
spending
too
much
time
on
their
devices
and
not
engaging
with
the
world
around
them
technology
has
undeniably
changed
the
way
people
live
today
and
how
they
might
be
living
without
it
although
it
can
be
beneficial
to
certain
aspects
of
life
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
negative
consequences
of
technological
dependence
after
researching
the
requirements
for
becoming
a
mechanic
i
learned
that
most
professionals
in
the
field
possess
a
diploma
from
a
technical
or
trade
school
have
worked
as
assistants
to
experienced
mechanics
for
several
years
and
have
aptitudes
for
mechanical
work
there
are
numerous
types
of
jobs
available
in
the
field
such
as
diesel
mechanics
who
specialize
in
working
with
heavy duty
equipment
and
automotive
technicians
who
specialize
in
cars
and
trucks
to
gain
hands on
experience
i
decided
to
visit
a
mechanic
company
i
was
able
to
talk
to
the
employees
and
ask
questions
about
their
daily
tasks
as
well
as
best
practices
in
the
industry
i
also
observed
the
mechanics
as
they
worked
on
different
repair
projects
gaining
valuable
insights
into
the
work
process
i
would
soon
be
doing
it
can
be
difficult
to
become
a
better
writer
the
most
important
step
is
to
find
an
experienced
writer
and
practice
your
skills
to
gain
additional
wisdom
and
inspiration
you
can
read
the
story
of
which
is
about
defying
odds
and
striving
for
greatness
additionally
you
can
explore
the
deeper
meaning
behind
the
phrase
all
in
or
it
is
about
putting
your
entire
effort
and
focus
into
something
to
make
it
happen
it
is
helpful
to
reexamine
your
own
life
experiences
in
order
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
this
message
finally
explore
your
current
weaknesses
and
practice
them
in
order
to
become
better
with
hard
work
and
dedication
it
is
possible
to
become
an
excellent
writer
in
a
world
where
first
impressions
can
be
misguided
by
preconceived
stereotypes
it
is
important
to
dig
deeper
into
the
history
and
implications
of
our
assumptions
a
superficial
reaction
to
a
person
s
ethnicity
dress
or
background
can
lead
to
a
shallow
understanding
of
their
culture
and
characters
as
we
gain
familiarity
with
someone
often
our
perception
can
change
drastically
and
lead
us
to
appreciate
the
nuances
and
complexities
of
their
lives
and
experiences
a
cursory
glance
at
an
object
or
artifact
can
lead
us
to
form
a
negative
opinion
before
we
take
the
time
to
learn
its
history
or
purpose
by
researching
its
background
story
we
may
find
that
our
initial
reaction
was
mistaken
and
that
our
opinion
has
been
swayed
by
our
past
biases
and
judgments
it
is
human
nature
to
make
snap
judgments
but
it
is
up
to
us
to
expand
our
awareness
and
understanding
if
we
want
to
break
down
barriers
and
push
past
previously
accepted
stereotypes
there
is
something
special
and
unique
about
visiting
a
park
going
to
any
park
is
a
fun
enjoyable
and
exciting
experience
and
no
matter
the
type
there
are
a
variety
of
activities
to
capture
the
imagination
and
create
lasting
memories
of
a
day
s
outing
parks
come
in
different
forms
such
as
neighborhood
parks
state
parks
national
parks
or
amusement
parks
and
they
all
offer
different
experiences
however
if
one
type
of
park
must
be
chosen
community
parks
provide
a
lot
of
interesting
activities
that
make
them
a
great
choice
for
all
not
only
do
these
parks
provide
a
wide
range
of
recreational
and
leisure
activities
such
as
playgrounds
open
areas
sport
courts
or
walking
trails
but
community
parks
serve
as
an
excellent
choice
for
children
for
a
variety
of
reasons
recent
research
shows
that
students
who
get
involved
in
extracurricular
activities
like
sports
music
or
art
can
show
an
improved
academic
performance
in
school
studies
have
also
proven
that
students
who
participate
in
activities
after
school
show
better
social
and
emotional
wellbeing
this
is
because
extracurricular
activities
give
children
a
place
to
meet
and
bond
with
other
children
outside
of
the
regular
school
environment
which
helps
in
developing
a
better
understanding
of
how
to
interact
with
peers
and
handle
social
situations
physical
activities
such
as
sports
have
the
added
benefit
of
increasing
physical
strength
and
endurance
this
helps
children
learn
better
in
class
and
improves
their
concentration
participating
in
sports
helps
children
maintain
a
healthy
lifestyle
and
build
up
a
stronger
immune
system
parents
should
be
interested
in
their
children
s
extra curricular
activities
as
they
provide
a
chance
for
them
to
grow
and
make
a
positive
difference
in
their
lives
the
positive
long term
effects
of
extracurricular
activities
include
increased
self confidence
better
time
management
skills
improved
discipline
and
a
better
understanding
of
how
important
working
together
as
a
team
is
all
of
these
benefits
can
not
only
help
students
succeed
now
but
also
benefit
them
in
the
future
graduating
early
from
high
school
is
becoming
increasingly
more
attainable
students
can
take
advantage
of
various
resources
such
as
online
classes
summer
school
and
staying
after
school
for
extra
help
to
gain
a
head
start
on
their
future
another
option
to
support
the
aim
of
graduating
early
is
to
bring
up
your
by
taking
extra
classes
participating
in
sports
or
switching
courses
with
the
help
of
your
teachers
it
is
also
important
to
evaluate
the
pros
and
cons
of
working
during
high
school
as
this
can
be
an
effective
way
to
prepare
for
adulthood
but
it
can
also
impact
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
serious
academic
work
further
it
is
worthwhile
to
investigate
if
there
are
any
graduation
policies
in
school
related
to
a
minimum
as
technology
continues
to
evolve
and
education
systems
become
more
accessible
more
and
more
students
face
difficult
choices
when
choosing
a
career
this
is
especially
true
in
countries
with
limited
resources
where
parents
decide
what
career
their
children
should
pursue
this
limits
young
people
s
opportunities
to
break
out
of
the
cycle
of
working
to
make
ends
meet
and
prevents
them
from
realizing
their
true
potential
for
teenagers
it
is
important
to
think
carefully
as
they
make
this
decision
for
themselves
while
a
good
education
is
generally
essential
for
pursuing
a
successful
career
job
opportunities
with
and
without
a
college
degree
or
diploma
may
vary
depending
on
the
region
and
the
resources
available
it
is
also
worth
considering
what
job
opportunities
the
states
may
offer
these
opportunities
can
be
unique
when
compared
with
those
in
other
countries
and
may
provide
different
paths
for
teenage
students
to
pursue
their
passions
it
is
also
important
for
teenagers
to
have
the
right
guidance
from
their
parents
at
a
young
age
parents
should
take
the
time
to
listen
to
their
children
and
understand
their
aspirations
by
encouraging
open
conversations
and
dialogues
parents
can
provide
valuable
support
and
advice
to
their
children
as
they
enter
this
critical
stage
of
their
lives
ultimately
this
will
help
teenagers
make
informed
and
sound
decisions
allowing
them
to
identify
and
pursue
a
career
that
is
more
suited
to
their
interests
and
goals
technology
has
become
intertwined
in
many
aspects
of
our
lives
both
positively
and
negatively
on
the
plus
side
advancements
in
technology
have
enabled
us
to

even
strengthened
with

features
like

the

can
offer

with
digital

tools
workers

on
the

technology
can
also
disrupt
relationships
lead
to
addiction
and
mental
health
issues
and
reduce
physical
activity
with
so
much
information
and
interaction
available
online
it
can
be
tough
to
disconnect
we
might
also
find
ourselves
distracted
from
our
social
work
and
educational
responsibilities
when
we
re
constantly
engaging
with
our
devices
plus
research
has
suggested
that
increased
screen
time
is
linked
to
sleeplessness
depression
and
anxiety
however
technology
can
also
be
used
to
promote
positivity
and
encourage
a
healthier
lifestyle
for
example
fitness
tracking
apps
meditation
tools
and
virtual
self care
activities
can
help
promote
mindfulness
and
emotional
wellbeing
additionally
social
media
can
be
used
to
share
inspiring
messages
and
create
online
communities
for
support
in
short
technology
can
have
a
far reaching
impact
on
our
lives
and
it
s
important
to
use
it
responsibly
with
an
awareness
of
its
potential
pros
and
cons
the
power
of
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
learn
and
access
education
with
the
emergence
of
massive
open
online
courses
and
virtual
classrooms
more
and
more
students
are
choosing
to
attend
their
classes
at
home
this
shift
in
the
education
system
brings
with
it
myriad
pros
and
cons
that
must
be
considered
on
one
hand
attending
classes
at
home
can
make
learning
more
accessible
and
efficient
for
students
freed
from
the
need
to
commute
for
long
hours
to
school
they
can
make
better
use
of
their
time
and
have
more
flexibility
additionally
virtual
classrooms
allow
students
to
form
meaningful
connections
with
peers
making
class
participation
more
engaging
however
there
are
a
few
drawbacks
to
this
trend
as
well
with
virtual
classrooms
it
is
more
difficult
to
monitor
the
progress
of
individual
students
as
well
as
for
them
to
access
additional
resources
such
as
libraries
and
labs
required
for
more
interactive
learning
furthermore
there
can
be
social
and
psychological
issues
that
arise
out
of
lack
of
physical
contact
and
face to face
interaction
in
the
end
allowing
students
to
attend
classes
at
home
can
be
a
great
way
to
expand
and
enhance
the
learning
experiences
of
students
provided
it
is
managed
properly
and
with
the
necessary
precautions
it
boils
down
to
the
individual
needs
of
the
students
and
how
well prepared
the
teachers
and
educators
are
to
make
learning
effective
despite
not
being
in
a
physical
classroom
in
a
world
of
constant
comparison
and
criticism
it
can
be
difficult
to
stay
true
to
yourself
being
ourselves
in
a
society
that
is
constantly
trying
to
push
us
to
fit
into
certain
standards
and
expectations
is
no
easy
feat
this
challenge
can
come
with
both
rewards
and
consequences
on
one
hand
standing
up
for
our
beliefs
and
embracing
our
true
selves
can
lead
to
a
greater
sense
of
self fulfillment
and
satisfaction
on
the
other
hand
refusing
to
conform
to
certain
societal
norms
can
lead
to
isolation
and
judgment
of
the
potential
risks
embracing
one
s
true
self
can
be
one
of
the
strongest
steps
we
take
towards
building
meaningful
relationships
and
renegotiating
our
own
identity
by
ceasing
to
strive
for
perfection
and
instead
accepting
one
s
flaws
and
traits
we
open
ourselves
up
to
those
around
us
in
the
hopes
of
fostering
more
genuine
connections
in
contrast
a
rigid
code
of
standards
and
adherence
to
traditional
ideas
of
beauty
can
alienate
us
and
limit
our
potential
it
is
essential
to
take
responsibility
for
our
individual
identities
and
never
lose
sight
of
our
own
values
through
the
promotion
of
self acceptance
we
can
achieve
unity
not
uniformity
in
this
way
instead
of
being
programmed
as
replicas
of
pre determined
standards
we
can
be
individuals
that
are
both
unique
and
united
in
our
personhood
offering
distance
learning
as
an
option
for
students
to
attend
classes
from
home
has
a
number
of
benefits
particularly
for
those
with
physical
disabilities
and or
economic
limitations
not
having
to
make
the
journey
to
and
from
school
for
those
with
physical
disabilities
can
make
a
big
difference
in
saving
energy
and
reducing
risk
of
injury
in
addition
the
cost
of
attendance
for
students
with
economic
constraints
can
be
substantially
reduced
by
eliminating
transportation
costs
furthermore
it
can
also
increase
accessibility
to
quality
education
and
expand
options
to
a
broader
range
of
students
regardless
of
their
physical
or
financial
limitations
in
short
distance
learning
has
proven
to
be
a
valuable
tool
for
students
with
physical
disabilities
and or
economic
limitations
allowing
them
to
access
greater
educational
opportunities
my
elementary
school
experience
was
a
unique
blend
of
the
fun
and
the
educational
i
enjoyed
the
friendships
i
made
in
the
classroom
going
on
field
trips
and
learning
new
things
i
think
the
most
enjoyable
aspect
was
the
sense
of
camaraderie
among
my
classmates
there
was
a
sense
of
unity
and
support
and
i
found
it
incredibly
heartwarming
however
there
were
certainly
areas
where
the
school
environment
could
be
improved
i
remember
feeling
unmotivated
in
some
classes
because
the
curriculum
wasn
t
engaging
i
also
think
there
could
have
been
more
emphasis
placed
on
extracurriculars
that
let
us
explore
our
passions
like
art
theatre
and
music
overall
my
elementary
school
experience
was
special
and
i
look
back
on
those
days
with
fondness
extended
school
days
have
a
major
impact
on
the
lives
of
students
on
a
practical
level
more
school
hours
means
less
time
for
sleep
which
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
concentration
levels
and
overall
productivity
by
spending
more
time
in
the
classroom
students
have
less
free
time
to
pursue
personal
interests
and
hobbies
as
well
as
less
time
to
spend
with
family
and
friends
outside
of
school
this
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
adjust
to
as
it
can
lead
to
feelings
of
fatigue
anxiety
and
even
depression
parents
can
help
by
finding
alternative
ways
to
make
up
for
the
lost
family
time
such
as
more
time
for
communal
meals
and
weekend
activities
in
general
more
school
days
can
have
considerable
impacts
on
the
lives
of
students
and
should
be
taken
into
careful
consideration
graduating
from
high
school
early
is
an
increasingly
popular
choice
that
reveals
a
number
of
benefits
and
drawbacks
for
students
graduating
early
allows
students
to
start
college
earlier
giving
them
a
head
start
on
their
higher
education
and
can
save
money
over
time
early
graduation
also
gives
students
more
time
to
pursue
interests
such
as
working
or
travel
and
explore
what
kind
of
career
path
they
wish
to
pursue
however
graduating
early
can
put
students
at
a
disadvantage
in
terms
of
social
development
since
they
will
have
missed
out
on
a
crucial
part
of
the
high
school
experience
in
addition
they
may
lack
the
necessary
knowledge
and
skills
due
to
not
having
the
same
educational
opportunities
as
their
peers
real world
experiences
from
those
who
have
chosen
to
graduate
early
suggest
that
success
can
and
has
been
achieved
however
the
key
is
to
make
sure
they
are
well prepared
and
have
a
solid
plan
for
the
future
this
includes
putting
in
extra
effort
to
gain
knowledge
and
skills
where
they
may
be
lacking
and
seeking
out
mentors
and
guidance
from
professionals
if
students
make
sure
they
ve
done
adequate
research
and
have
set
realistic
goals
before
making
the
choice
to
graduate
early
the
chances
of
success
are
much
higher
decisions
are
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
as
we
age
we
become
increasingly
responsible
for
making
these
decisions
so
it
is
important
to
have
the
right
people
to
consult
when
determining
the
best
course
of
action
people
often
seek
out
multiple
sources
of
advice
when
making
decisions
because
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
others
can
often
help
them
arrive
at
a
well informed
and
thoughtful
conclusion
family
members
especially
parents
are
typically
the
first
people
we
turn
to
when
making
decisions
this
is
because
our
parents
deep
knowledge
and
understanding
of
life
often
proves
invaluable
for
our
decision making
process
parents
often
have
a
knack
for
generating
ideas
and
strategies
that
we
may
not
have
previously
considered
additionally
they
generally
have
more
life
experience
than
us
and
can
thus
point
out
potential
consequences
of
a
decision
we
hadn
t
thought
of
along
with
parents
other
adults
such
as
teachers
coaches
and
mentors
can
also
offer
invaluable
advice
their
experience
working
with
people
of
our
age
group
can
be
very
helpful
in
understanding
our
perspective
and
how
it
affects
our
decision making
process
in
addition
talking
to
peers
elders
and
people
from
different
backgrounds
can
provide
us
with
a
variety
of
perspectives
that
could
provide
a
better
context
for
us
in
selecting
a
course
of
action
making
decisions
can
be
a
daunting
task
but
having
a
variety
of
sources
to
help
guide
us
can
be
a
tremendous
help
gathering
knowledge
and
advice
from
a
variety
of
people
can
enable
us
to
arrive
at
more
informed
decisions
that
are
more
likely
to
produce
the
best
results
first
impressions
are
a
powerful
influence
on
forming
relationships
a
strong
first
impression
can
lead
to
increased
self confidence
and
a
higher
positive
reputation
conversely
a
poor
first
impression
can
have
an
immensely
negative
effect
on
one
s
self image
and
social
standing
in
situations
where
first
impressions
can
go
wrong
it
is
important
to
evaluate
and
analyze
how
it
is
affecting
the
image
you
are
presenting
for
instance
an
individual
may
be
judged
by
their
clothing
or
mannerisms
in
an
interview
impacting
the
interviewer
s
opinion
of
them
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
effect
first
impressions
have
both
positively
and
negatively
in
order
to
properly
project
and
maintain
your
self image
i
agree
with
s
assertion
that
personal
growth
requires
us
to
challenge
ourselves
and
push
past
our
comfort
zones
this
is
certainly
something
i
have
experienced
myself
for
example
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
was
interested
in
pursuing
a
degree
in
however
i
did
n t
believe
that
i
had
the
math
skillset
to
pursue
this
field
and
felt
that
taking
it
on
was
a
risk
too
great
for
me
after
much
soul
searching
and
a
conversation
with
a
professor
in
the
field
i
decided
to
take
the
plunge
and
to
invest
in
developing
my
math
skills
this
decision
vastly
changed
the
trajectory
of
my
life
upon
graduating
with
my
degree
in
i
realized
that
it
was
pushing
myself
beyond
my
own
limits
and
doing
something
i
thought
was
impossible
that
forced
me
to
grow
this
was
a
true
turning
point
in
my
life
and
an
experience
i
will
never
forget
it
showed
me
the
power
of
challenging
ourselves
and
trying
something
beyond
our
own
abilities
i
am
passionate
about
expressing
my
creativity
through
various
types
of
art
such
as
painting
drawing
and
photography
i
have
enjoyed
researching
how
art
pieces
are
sold
and
the
value
that
they
can
currently
bring
in
the
market
but
i
understand
that
creating
art
is
not
always
easy
it
requires
a
lot
of
patience
and
practice
and
even
then
mistakes
may
be
encountered
however
i
have
found
that
with
enough
perseverance
these
mistakes
can
transform
into
successes
i
enjoy
keeping
the
pieces
i
create
as
a
memory
and
sometimes
giving
them
to
family
members
with
the
cost
being
worth
it
for
the
special
connection
it
creates
continuing
to
explore
new
ideas
and
techniques
has
been
a
worthwhile
journey
when
facing
adversity
and
failure
many
of
us
give
up
in
discouragement
and
despair
however
embracing
the
importance
of
enthusiasm
can
be
the
key
factor
to
finding
success
not
only
gives
us
strength
to
persevere
in
difficult
situations
but
it
also
brings
creative
thinking
and
allows
us
to
come
up
with
innovative
solutions
to
our
challenges
i
remember
my
own
experience
of
failure
i
worked
hard
for
months
on
a
science
project
to
present
in
my
final
exam
when
i
got
my
results
back
i
found
out
i
had
failed
at
that
moment
i
felt
like
my
world
had
come
crashing
down
and
i
was
all
set
to
give
up
and
abandon
my
dream
of
becoming
a
scientist
but
then
i
thought
of
all
the
enthusiasm
i
had
put
in
during
the
months
of
hard
work
and
of
my
parents
faith
in
my
ambition
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
filled
with
a
renewed
enthusiasm
and
i
was
determined
to
try
again
i
poured
my
energy
and
enthusiasm
into
the
project
and
ultimately
i
was
willing
to
take
the
risk
of
success
or
failure
and
i
passed
the
exam
with
higher
than
expected
results
this
illustrates
that
enthusiasm
can
be
the
foundation
for
achieving
success
in
times
of
failure
whether
it
is
a
school
assignment
a
job
a
career
or
even
a
simple
hobby
having
a
strong
enthusiasm
will
help
build
inner
strength
and
courage
to
push
our
boundaries
and
rise
to
success
online

many
advantages
for

those

i
have
always
been
aware
of
the
power
of
first
impressions
from
the
way
i
introduce
myself
to
someone
new
to
the
way
i
greet
a
friend
when
we
meet
i
know
that
the
small
details
of
an
initial
interaction
can
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
how
people
feel
about
one
another
my
own
experiences
have
taught
me
that
first
impressions
can
be
difficult
to
get
right
yet
they
can
have
a
lasting
impression
on
how
i
am
viewed
and
perceived
by
others
over
time
i
have
come
to
recognize
that
it
is
n t
always
the
first
words
or
gestures
that
matter
but
rather
how
i
engage
with
someone
that
is
most
important
this
shift
in
my
understanding
of
first
impressions
has
helped
me
to
connect
more
authentically
with
others
one
of
the
most
famous
individuals
who
has
achieved
success
by
being
unapologetically
themselves
is
ellen
degeneres
courageously
came
out
as
a
lesbian
on
her
show
in
setting
an
example
for
many
people
to
follow
her
unique
sense
of
humor
and
upbeat
attitude
has
earned
her
much
admiration
in
the
entertainment
industry
even
after
coming
out
what
makes
this
individual
stand
out
is
her
willingness
to
be
vulnerable
and
authentic
to
her
fans
degeneres
never
shied
away
from
showing
who
she
truly
is
despite
the
risk
that
it
could
have
cost
her
endorsements
and
fans
this
demonstrates
the
risk benefit
of
wanting
to
be
just
like
someone
else
versus
following
the
crowd
s
advice
concerning
the
importance
of
being
yourself
has
been
echoed
throughout
the
years
he
states
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
surprisingly
the
most
important
requirement
for
achieving
success
in
life
is
much
less
complicated
than
trying
to
be
just
like
someone
else
or
following
the
crowd
it
is
to
be
true
to
yourself take
the
path
that
is
unique
to
you
being
true
to
yourself
requires
the
courage
to
face
fears
and
reject
the
expectations
placed
on
us
by
society
by
being
honest
with
yourself
and
setting
your
own
expectations
you
can
be
content
with
who
you
are
and
discover
the
valuable
role
that
you
can
play
in
improving
the
world
in
conclusion
the
importance
of
being
yourself
should
never
be
underestimated
despite
the
risks
and
pressures
of
society
it
is
essential
to
embrace
one
s
own
unique
qualities
and
dreams
only
then
can
one
discover
true
freedom
and
success
when
it
comes
to
the
debate
of
whether
or
not
after
school
homework
club
should
be
allowed
in
our
schools
there
are
compelling
arguments
against
it
it
has
been
shown
to
negatively
impact
family
time
significantly
reduce
the
potential
for
sports
and
activities
and
limit
gaming
opportunities
take
the
situation
of
for
instance
had
been
trying
to
make
time
to
attend
his
daughter
s
piano
recital
the
past
few
weeks
but
had
to
keep
missing
it
due
to
the
demands
of
his
after
school
homework
club
his
daughter
was
disappointed
and
he
had
to
miss
the
one
thing
he
was
looking
forward
to
similarly
was
asked
to
leave
her
basketball
team
on
account
of
her
having
to
attend
her
after
school
homework
club
every
day
despite
being
an
ace
player
she
was
unable
to
participate
in
the
game
due
to
her
class like
commitment
to
her
after
school
homework
club
finally
there
s
who
had
been
taking
a
break
from
her
after
school
homework
club
one
day
to
enjoy
her
favorite
video
game
she
was
about
to
reach
new
levels
when
her
friends
in
her
after
school
homework
club
group
chat
asked
where
she
was
due
to
the
fear
of
being
criticized
for
not
fulfilling
her
commitment
she
gave
up
her
beloved
gaming
session
as
well
as
potentially
losing
out
on
new
subscribers
to
her
channel
the
examples
of
and
show
how
much
of
an
impact
after
school
homework
club
can
have
on
recreational
activities
and
family
time
this
shows
how
we
should
consider
other
options
besides
after
school
homework
club
to
benefit
our
children
attending
online
classes
or
video
conferencing
from
home
versus
in person
instruction
presents
several
distinct
differences
student
attention
has
been
found
to
be
more
focused
and
consistent
in
virtual
classes
according
to
a
study
from
the
students
attention
held
for
longer
during
video
conference
classes
than
in person
classes
communication
during
virtual
classes
is
also
more
effective
as
the
use
of
comprehensive
real time
tools
enables
teachers
to
connect
with
students
more
naturally
leading
to
better
understanding
and
retention
to
resources
is
also
greater
with
virtual
classes
as
students
can
benefit
from
at home
learning
tools
such
as
textbooks
online
libraries
and
even
direct
instruction
from
virtual
tutors
students
who
attend
virtual
classes
acquire
greater
knowledge
as
the
flexibility
of
the
online
model
allows
them
to
move
at
their
own
pace
and
receive
greater
instruction
personalized
to
their
learning
style
after
researching
several
successful
people
who
have
achieved
their
goals
despite
the
hardships
they
faced
some
of
the
strategies
they
utilized
included
resilience
hard
work
and
a
positive
attitude
these
individuals
had
to
overcome
challenges
such
as
fear
of
failure
and
lack
of
resources
the
essential
qualities
one
must
have
to
become
successful
include
dedication
discipline
resilience
resourcefulness
self confidence
and
a
willingness
to
learn
these
qualities
enable
them
to
make
the
most
of
the
resources
available
to
them
and
to
persevere
in
the
face
of
difficulty
furthermore
the
successful
people
often
had
certain
advantages
that
helped
them
on
their
path
to
success
these
included
access
to
networks
of
influential
people
resources
to
help
finance
their
dreams
and
an
education
that
provided
them
with
knowledge
and
skills
essential
to
achieving
their
goals
the
importance
of
education
in
achieving
one
s
goals
can
not
be
overstated
provides
individuals
with
the
skills
and
knowledge
to
confidently
pursue
their
ambitions
as
well
as
access
to
a
supportive
network
and
resources
to
help
them
on
their
journey
all
of
these
make
a
profound
difference
in
the
ability
of
the
individual
to
reach
their
goals
is
a
right
that
should
be
respected
and
pursued
by
everyone
in
a
community
this
applies
particularly
to
students
and
teachers
because
through
their
daily
lives
they
are
making
meaningful
contributions
to
their
school
and
wider
society
electing
a
president
is
a
prime
example
of
how
an
individual
can
make
a
difference
in
their
local
community
a
president
serves
to
represent
students
and
teachers
and
having
a
say
on
who
will
lead
them
is
an
important
way
to
voice
their
opinions
by
voting
individuals
may
express
their
views
in
critical
decision making
processes
aside
from
the
obvious
benefit
of
having
their
choice
reflected
in
the
final
outcome
the
act
of
voting
itself
helps
to
promote
fairness
and
eliminates
any
potential
biases
everyone
is
given
the
same
opportunity
to
make
a
difference
and
all
votes
are
counted
equally
in
this
way
an
individual
s
voice
is
not
only
heard
it
is
valued
is
a
fundamental
right
that
everyone
has
the
privilege
of
taking
part
in
through
voting
individuals
are
able
to
contribute
towards
a
fairer
and
democratic
community
it
is
something
that
both
students
and
teachers
can
practice
in
order
to
make
their
opinions
known
and
effect
real
change
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
many
people
s
daily
lives
with
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
society
has
revolutionized
the
way
in
which
we
interact
with
the
world
impacting
every
aspect
from
education
and
healthcare
to
law
enforcement
on
the
positive
side
technology
has
made
many
tasks
easier
allowing
us
to
do
more
in
less
time
from
online
communication
to
sophisticated
technology
has
the
potential
to
make
a
real
impact
in
our
everyday
lives
additionally
technology
plays
a
huge
role
in
society
today
influencing
the
way
we
engage
with
others
and
how
culture
is
developed
and
experienced
looking
ahead
technology
is
advancing
rapidly
and
its
use
in
the
years
to
come
will
have
wide reaching
implications
for
the
world
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
technology
further
shapes
our
lives
in
the
future
an
advanced
learning
experience
can
be
beneficial
but
it
s
important
to
understand
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
it
can
bring
to
a
student
s
career
experience
graduating
early
from
a
more
advanced
program
can
be
beneficial
in
some
cases
with
the
potential
to
put
a
student
ahead
of
their
peers
in
gaining
experience
and
potential
scholarships
however
some
students
may
struggle
to
keep
up
or
might
be
overwhelmed
when
faced
with
a
more
rigorous
curriculum
the
impact
of
an
advanced
learning
experience
on
human
society
continues
to
be
felt
as
students
who
are
able
to
gain
a
wealth
of
knowledge
before
making
their
way
through
college
are
better
prepared
and
equipped
to
make
their
mark
on
the
world
pre ap
classes
can
help
open
the
door
to
success
as
they
bring
the
possibility
of
obtaining
scholarships
and
other
awards
with
hard
work
dedication
and
a
commitment
to
their
studies
these
students
can
reach
heights
beyond
their
peers
in
the
end
the
advantages
of
these
opportunities
far
outweigh
the
disadvantages
when
it
comes
to
making
important
decisions
it
is
often
beneficial
to
seek
counsel
from
multiple
sources
asking
for
advice
from
a
variety
of
people
can
provide
insight
into
different
perspectives
and
ideas
that
may
have
otherwise
been
overlooked
asking
for
advice
from
friends
family
members
and
mentors
can
be
very
empowering
as
it
can
give
necessary
support
and
practical
guidance
the
input
of
those
around
us
can
provide
valuable
information
that
s
not
accessible
in
single source
research
pieces
of
advice
and
opinions
can
help
us
understand
the
situation
from
multiple
angles
and
draw
conclusions
or
make
decisions
in
a
thorough
manner
after
gathering
advice
from
multiple
sources
we
can
reflect
on
the
counsel
we
ve
received
and
develop
best
possible
solutions
to
our
problems
moreover
asking
for
advice
can
serve
as
a
helpful
reminder
that
navigating
life
s
challenges
can
not
be
done
alone
this
simple
act
of
seeking
guidance
can
help
build
self confidence
and
resilience
and
likewise
impart
knowledge
and
wisdom
from
those
who
ve
gone
through
similar
experiences
by
leveraging
the
valuable
insights
of
the
people
around
us
we
can
make
choices
that
ultimately
have
a
positive
impact
on
our
lives
in
summary
it
is
advantageous
to
seek
advice
from
multiple
people
in
order
to
gain
useful
and
unique
perspectives
that
can
help
us
make
better
informed
decisions
in
doing
so
not
only
will
we
learn
which
choices
lead
to
success
but
we
can
also
develop
meaningful
connections
with
the
people
that
are
around
us
imposing
curfews
on
teenagers
is
often
a
contentious
issue
as
the
traditional
age
for
adolescence
brings
with
it
a
desire
to
explore
the
world
around
them
and
establish
independence
a
weekday
curfew
and
midnight
weekend
curfew
can
make
it
difficult
for
teenagers
to
socialize
with
their
peers
leading
them
to
stay
out
late
in
an
effort
to
spend
as
much
time
as
possible
with
their
friends
in
addition
some
teenagers
may
try
to
circumvent
their
curfews
by
sneaking
out
after
the
time
limit
has
been
set
and
attempt
to
sneak
back
in
before
their
parents
wake
up
not
adhering
to
a
curfew
may
also
cause
tension
between
teenagers
and
their
parents
as
well
as
potential
trouble
with
the
authorities
if
curfew
violations
are
reported
as
such
it
is
important
to
consider
the
implications
of
a
curfew
and
be
aware
that
it
may
influence
a
teenager
s
behavior
in
a
variety
of
ways
working
in
a
group
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
compared
to
working
alone
work
allows
us
to
gain
knowledge
from
our
peers
encouraging
us
to
think
outside
of
the
box
and
come
up
with
unique
and
creative
solutions
for
example
when
i
was
working
on
a
group
project
in
college
i
had
the
benefit
of
working
alongside
three
other
students
who
each
had
their
own
area
of
expertise
together
we
were
able
to
create
a
highly
effective
solution
that
drew
from
each
of
our
strengths
whereas
if
i
was
working
alone
the
quality
of
the
results
would
have
likely
suffered
collaborating
with
peers
on
a
project
or
task
helps
us
stay
organized
and
on
task
we
are
more
motivated
to
stay
focused
and
complete
the
assignment
in
a
timely
manner
than
if
we
were
working
independently
since
we
do
n t
want
to
let
our
group
members
down
plus
we
are
able
to
keep
up
with
the
progress
of
our
peers
which
adds
a
layer
of
accountability
to
each
member
of
the
group
despite
the
advantages
of
group
work
some
may
argue
that
it
can
lead
to
wasted
time
and
disagreements
between
peers
yet
with
proper
planning
and
communication
these
issues
can
be
minimized
establishing
group
rules
and
mutually
agreed upon
goals
can
help
ensure
that
everyone
is
on
the
same
page
and
that
decisions
are
being
made
efficiently
additionally
setting
due
dates
and
holding
each
member
of
the
team
accountable
to
their
individual
tasks
will
help
minimize
conflicts
and
wasted
time
to
sum
up
working
in
a
group
comes
with
numerous
benefits
that
can
enhance
the
process
and
quality
of
completing
an
assignment
with
proper
planning
and
communication
disagreements
and
wasted
time
can
be
minimized
allowing
groups
to
maximize
their
effectiveness
as
demonstrated
group
work
can
be
much
more
beneficial
than
working
alone
and
should
be
the
preferred
method
for
completing
projects
or
tasks
the
renowned
british
statesman
once
famously
said
that
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
his
words
express
a
powerful
idea
that
failure
is
essential
for
success
this
notion
is
particularly
relevant
in
our
modern
lives
where
every
day
we
set
ourselves
goals
and
strive
for
success
in
all
aspects
of
our
lives
in
order
for
us
to
reach
our
goals
it
is
inevitable
that
we
will
experience
failure
along
the
way
this
should
be
embraced
rather
than
feared
as
failure
often
gives
us
insight
and
teaches
us
valuable
lessons
we
should
use
this
knowledge
to
help
power
us
towards
our
ultimate
goals
the
key
to
maintaining
enthusiasm
throughout
this
process
is
to
remain
optimistic
and
focus
on
our
progress
with
each
failure
we
gain
more
experience
and
knowledge
which
can
be
used
on
our
journey
to
success
viewing
failure
in
a
positive
light
allows
us
to
stay
motivated
and
benefit
from
the
lessons
learned
having
a
strong
mindset
and
the
right
attitude
can
be
the
difference
between
succeeding
and
throwing
in
the
towel
s
quote
encapsulates
the
idea
that
it
is
possible
to
utilize
failure
to
propel
us
towards
our
desired
outcomes
by
keeping
our
enthusiasm
alive
and
staying
optimistic
we
set
ourselves
up
for
achieving
our
greatest
successes
the
debate
between
a
hard
working
attitude
and
a
positive
attitude
is
one
that
has
been
pursued
for
ages
while
it
is
true
that
positive
thinking
can
yield
many
rewards
most
would
agree
that
possessing
a
hard
working
attitude
is
often
much
more
beneficial
in
achieving
success
in
life
requires
dedication
perseverance
and
hard
work
and
a
hard
working
attitude
will
provide
these
traits
when
facing
any
challenge
having
a
hard
work
attitude
allows
an
individual
to
take
action
and
turn
ambition
into
reality
rather
than
feelings
of
lofty
aspirations
a
hard
working
attitude
involves
taking
personal
responsibility
setting
meaningful
goals
and
putting
the
necessary
amount
of
effort
and
time
towards
arriving
at
the
desired
outcome
it
fosters
a
sense
of
relentless
determination
in
spite
of
failure
and
requires
strength
of
character
and
an
unwillingness
to
give
up
a
hard
worker
will
also
be
more
accountable
for
their
failures
and
successes
they
will
strive
to
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
seek
to
improve
on
them
rather
than
simply
making
excuses
and
blaming
external
forces
this
is
the
kind
of
attitude
that
will
ultimately
be
beneficial
for
any
individual
striving
to
reach
their
goals
in
life
ultimately
having
a
hard
working
attitude
is
essential
for
self improvement
and
advancement
which
are
essential
components
in
achieving
success
in
life
possessing
a
hard
working
attitude
will
allow
an
individual
to
continue
to
strive
for
excellence
and
be
rewarded
with
accomplishments
they
can
be
proud
of
a
hard
working
attitude
will
provide
the
commitment
and
dedication
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
reach
any
goal
as
i
began
my
journey
in
school
i
tried
to
take
advantage
of
all
the
resources
it
had
to
offer
i
participated
in
school
role plays
to
develop
my
confidence
and
took
part
in
fun
and
safe
science
experiments
to
increase
my
attention
and
focus
i
also
explored
my
hidden
talents
finding
a
particular
love
for
music
and
used
it
to
express
myself
with
a
positive
mindset
and
an
eagerness
to
learn
i
embraced
all
these
opportunities
and
used
them
to
develop
new
skills
and
become
a
better
version
of
myself
taking
courses
over
the
summer
or
in
the
evening
offers
numerous
benefits
for
high
school
students
looking
to
graduate
early
one
of
the
most
attractive

or

can
provide
high
school
students
with
a
wealth
of
benefits
from
bridging
gaps
in
their
education
to
exploring
educational
opportunities
outside
the
classroom
for
students
looking
to
graduate
earlier
these
courses
are
a
great
way
to
maximize
their
time
and
make
the
most
of
their
high
school
experience
it
is
easy
to
think
that
in
order
to
be
successful
in
life
we
must
put
our
own
individual
preferences
and
values
to
the
side
in
order
to
focus
solely
on
goal
achievement
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
order
to
be
truly
successful
it
is
essential
to
stay
true
to
ourselves
it
is
only
when
we
embrace
our
unique
qualities
and
abilities
that
we
can
make
the
most
out
of
our
lives
achieve
our
goals
and
enjoy
true
satisfaction
in
life
one
of
the
most
important
things
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
success
looks
different
for
everyone
what
works
for
one
person
may
not
work
for
another
so
it
s
important
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
recognize
that
there
is
no
one size fits all
formula
for
success
we
must
find
our
own
way
to
achieve
our
goals
while
being
true
to
ourselves
this
means
being
honest
about
who
we
are
our
goals
our
passions
and
our
values
only
then
can
we
truly
commit
to
our
goals
and
make
meaningful
progress
another
key
to
success
is
having
a
clear
and
achievable
plan
it
is
essential
to
set
realistic
targets
and
take
action
to
reach
them
we
should
also
be
mindful
of
our
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
such
knowledge
can
help
shape
our
plans
when
approaching
our
plans
it
is
also
important
to
stay
flexible
and
allow
ourselves
to
adjust
our
goals
as
needed
through
this
method
of
genuine
effort
and
hard
work
we
can
create
a
path
that
is
both
meaningful
and
true
to
ourselves
ultimately
the
key
to
achieving
success
while
staying
true
to
who
we
are
lies
in
the
deliberate
pursuit
of
our
goals
and
the
courage
to
stay
true
to
what
matters
to
us
by
embracing
our
own
definition
of
success
and
having
the
strength
to
pursue
it
we
can
find
true
success
in
life
and
create
a
future
that
is
both
meaningful
and
rewarding
homeschooling
can
provide
many
advantages
over
traditional
school
settings
such
as
the
ability
to
personalize
the
curriculum
and
the
ability
to
work
at
the
student
s
own
pace
however
there
can
also
be
some
disadvantages
to
homeschooling
such
as
added
stress
for
the
parent
a
lack
of
social
interaction
and
potential
deficits
in
technology
access
and
other
special
resources
to
make
homeschooling
successful
parents
should
ensure
that
they
have
a
lesson
plan
a
strong
support
system
and
a
flexible
schedule
parents
of
children
attending
traditional
schools
should
review
their
child
s
curriculum
and
make
sure
they
stay
organized
they
should
also
ensure
that
their
children
have
access
to
as
many
resources
as
possible
whether
through
the
school
or
online
ultimately
parents
should
decide
what
works
best
for
their
child
s
learning
needs
and
unique
goals
preparing
for
the
tournament
took
dedication
and
hard
work
i
studied
the
different
characters
learning
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
i
read
up
on
strategies
and
techniques
spending
hours
in
practice
sessions
to
solidify
my
understanding
i
watched
professional
players
on
and
streamed
sites
for
tips
on
how
to
make
my
game
great
i
even
looked
for
local
tournaments
signing
up
to
compete
against
local
players
to
test
my
skills
finally
i
joined
an
online
tournament
connecting
with
players
from
around
the
world
and
further
refining
my
gameplay
with
all
the
hard
work
i
was
ready
to
face
the
tournament
and
come
out
victorious
lack
of
self confidence
in
students
is
a
widespread
issue
that
can
be
attributed
to
several
different
factors
factors
that
contribute
to
a
lack
of
confidence
can
include
social
pressures
academic
struggles
and
a
lack
of
recognition
for
success
fortunately
there
are
strategies
that
students
can
use
to
build
their
self confidence
and
overcome
these
issues
and
accomplishment
are
two
key
elements
in
building
self confidence
praise
can
help
boost
one
s
morale
and
give
them
the
motivation
to
keep
going
while
accomplishment
can
show
one
s
success
and
help
build
a
sense
of
pride
however
there
are
also
numerous
challenges
that
students
face
when
trying
to
build
their
self confidence
for
some
risk taking
may
be
a
difficult
prospect
while
others
may
find
it
hard
to
shake
off
the
effects
of
personal
problems
understanding
and
addressing
these
issues
students
can
make
strides
when
it
comes
to
boosting
their
self confidence
the
american
was
a
pivotal
moment
in
history
ushering
in
a
new
era
of
freedom
and
democracy
two
of
its
figures
and
played
an
important
role
in
shaping
the
course
of
the
was
a
noted
author
and
philosopher
whose
thorough
analysis
of
the
injustices
endured
by
the
british
colonies
ultimately
inspired
many
of
his
fellow
patriots
to
take
up
arms
and
fight
for
independence
his
writings
such
as
the
of
left
a
lasting
mark
on
the
history
and
values
of
the
states
in
a
famous
quote
famously
said
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
self evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
and
the
pursuit
of
which
reaffirmed
the
ideals
of
freedom
and
justice
for
all
his
words
served
to
unite
the
patriots
in
their
cause
creating
a
strong
sense
of
purpose
and
commitment
too
was
greatly
influenced
by
his
experience
in
the
american
his
writing
during
the
war
particularly
in
his
thoughts
on
outlined
his
views
on
how
human
rights
and
the
rule
of
law
should
be
preserved
and
upheld
in
the
new
nation
through
his
writings
spoke
to
the
importance
of
a
just
and
equitable
government
and
of
the
need
for
individuals
to
be
allowed
to
secured
their
natural
rights
and
were
two
of
the
most
influential
founding
fathers
through
their
words
deeds
and
involvement
in
the
they
were
able
to
help
shape
the
values
and
ideals
of
the
states
to
this
day
both
of
these
figures
remain
as
important
symbols
of
freedom
and
justice
for
generations
to
come
classes
provide
an
interesting
way
for
students
to
learn
allowing
them
to
access
content
at
any
time
and
on
any
device
nevertheless
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
taking
classes
online
which
are
particularly
evident
when
considering
the
effects
of
these
classes
on
students
of
different
ages
the
primary
advantage
to
taking
classes
online
is
accessibility
for
younger
students
such
as
those
in
kindergarten
or
elementary
school
electronic
devices
may
mean
access
to
better
educational
content
than
what
is
available
in
the
classroom
additionally
online
classes
allow
students
to
remain
in
school
even
during
the
event
of
an
unexpected
illness
or
family
conflict
in
these
cases
online
classes
give
students
the
ability
to
remain
in
class
without
having
to
leave
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
however
there
are
also
various
disadvantages
to
taking
classes
online
perhaps
most
significantly
the
cost
of
tuition
for
these
classes
may
be
exceptionally
high
making
it
difficult
for
those
with
limited
financial
resources
to
access
the
content
furthermore
access
to
the
internet
and
necessary
electronic
devices
can
be
a
challenge
as
not
all
students
have
access
to
these
items
for
those
who
do
these
costly
items
may
need
to
be
regularly
updated
in
order
to
remain
compatible
with
upcoming
lessons
overall
taking
classes
online
has
its
positives
and
negatives
although
many
students
find
great
benefit
in
taking
classes
online
due
to
convenience
cost
and
access
it
is
important
to
consider
the
varying
degrees
of
difficulty
in
terms
of
access
to
technology
and
tuition
by
doing
so
each
individual
student
will
be
able
to
decide
whether
online
classes
are
the
best
fit
for
their
own
needs
at
the
students
must
choose
the
courses
for
their
chosen
profession
at
an
early
age
this
practice
has
both
pros
and
cons
for
both
the
students
and
their
parents
on
the
plus
side
this
system
allows
the
students
to
get
more
in depth
experience
in
the
field
they
ve
chosen
it
also
allows
the
school
to
tailor
its
teaching
efforts
to
the
needs
of
the
student
body
since
it
will
already
know
the
courses
that
need
to
be
taught
however
this
system
of
course
selection
can
be
limiting
for
students
if
their
interests
or
ambitions
change
over
time
they
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
courses
outside
of
their
chosen
profession
additionally
even
when
students
want
to
pursue
a
different
career
they
may
be
forced
to
take
courses
for
their
chosen
profession
it
is
therefore
important
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
before
implementing
a
system
of
mandatory
course
selection
after
considering
the
opinion
of
both
students
and
parents
it
is
clear
that
flexibility
and
personal
choice
are
essential
components
of
a
successful
school
curriculum
allowing
students
to
choose
their
courses
late
in
their
high
school
career
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
delve
into
different
fields
and
discover
their
true
passions
in
our
daily
lives
we
are
always
encouraged
to
keep
busy
and
to
reach
for
bigger
and
better
things
while
completing
tasks
and
taking
on
projects
we
can
certainly
accomplish
a
lot
there
is
also
much
to
be
said
about
moments
of
inactivity
and
stillness
offers
the
chance
for
reflection
rest
and
a
chance
to
practice
mindfulness
for
example
take
the
physical
activity
of
yoga
intentional
pauses
are
taken
between
poses
and
postures
which
allow
for
deep
breathing
calming
the
mind
and
emotions
and
balance
those
moments
of
inactivity
help
to
create
a
balanced
experience
and
provide
an
opportunity
for
increased
strength
and
flexibility
which
is
the
overall
goal
of
yoga
similarly
research
has
shown
that
pauses
in
work related
activities
are
beneficial
these
short
rests
are
believed
to
increase
productivity
and
allow
for
better
and
more
creative
solutions
in
preventing
feelings
of
burn out
moments
of
inactivity
can
lead
to
a
higher
quality
of
the
work
we
produce
and
more
job
satisfaction
in
conclusion
it
is
my
strong
belief
that
a
balance
between
doing
and
being
is
essential
to
success
both
activity
and
inactivity
serve
a
purpose
and
when
incorporated
into
our
lives
can
greatly
benefit
our
goals
and
accomplishments
distance
learning
has
been
an
attractive
option
for
many
students
who
have
disabilities
or
who
do
n t
enjoy
traditional
school
it
allows
these
students
to
access
educational
opportunities
without
having
to
navigate
the
many
obstacles
they
often
face
in
a
physical
classroom
setting
the
benefits
of
distance
learning
for
students
with
disabilities
are
numerous
and
include
increased
access
to
educational
materials
personalized
instruction
and
a
greater
sense
of
independence
firstly
students
with
disabilities
are
often
subject
to
limited
accessibility
issues
in
traditional
school
such
as
limited
access
to
materials
or
physical
spaces
through
distance
learning
these
students
can
access
educational
materials
on
their
own
time
when
and
where
it
is
most
convenient
for
them
to
do
so
in
addition
distance
learning
programs
provide
personalized
instruction
suited
to
each
student
s
individual
needs
with
online
teachers
readily
available
to
offer
help
and
assistance
when
needed
students
can
tailor
their
learning
experience
to
their
own
strengths
and
weaknesses
this
can
provide
a
sense
of
control
for
students
with
disabilities
allowing
them
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
and
in
a
way
that
works
best
for
them
finally
distance
learning
gives
students
with
disabilities
more
autonomy
and
independence
they
no
longer
need
to
worry
about
transporting
themselves
to
traditional
school
dealing
with
the
possibility
of
bullying
or
discrimination
or
keeping
up
with
a
strict
school
schedule
instead
they
can
learn
on
their
own
time
on
their
own
terms
reducing
feelings
of
helplessness
and
frustration
in
conclusion
distance
learning
is
a
beneficial
and
valuable
resource
for
students
with
disabilities
or
students
who
may
not
feel
like
they
fit
into
traditional
school
with
greater
access
personalization
and
autonomy
these
students
can
gain
the
education
and
confidence
they
need
to
flourish
drama
and
art
classes
have
long
been
required
in
many
schools
but
it
is
worth
questioning
whether
these
are
essential
courses
for
students
to
take
it
can
be
argued
that
these
classes
should
be
electives
rather
than
required
courses
in
many
cases
these
classes
can
be
pointless
for
some
students
for
instance
a
student
who
does
not
have
an
inclination
or
desire
to
learn
an
instrument
or
create
art
may
go
through
the
motions
without
actually
absorbing
the
material
or
making
any
real
progress
for
some
these
classes
can
become
a
chore
and
not
a
source
of
joy
or
learning
music
drama
and
art
classes
can
be
unfair
for
students
with
different
abilities
many
creative
subjects
necessitate
creativity
skill
and or
talent
to
excel
something
which
not
all
students
have
forcing
less able
students
to
take
these
classes
can
result
in
them
feeling
isolated
and
unable
to
keep
up
with
their
peers
finally
these
classes
are
not
always
necessary
when
it
comes
to
achieving
education
goals
classes
such
as
and
are
vital
in
order
to
acquire
qualifications
and
pass
standardized
tests
which
can
lead
to
future
career
opportunities
while
learning
about
music
drama
and
art
can
be
enjoyable
they
are
not
always
the
most
important
classes
for
students
to
take
in
conclusion
music
drama
and
art
classes
should
not
be
required
and
should
instead
be
offered
as
electives
these
classes
can
be
irrelevant
or
difficult
for
some
students
and
are
not
always
the
most
important
when
it
comes
to
pursuing
an
education
first
impressions
are
made
quickly
and
can
have
lasting
impacts
on
relationships
and
our
view
of
the
world
while
first
impressions
are
vital
they
are
not
always
an
accurate
representation
of
someone
or
something
first
impressions
are
based
on
our
own
personal
biases
assumptions
and
judgments
which
can
lead
to
a
distorted
initial
assessment
for
example
a
prospective
employer
might
make
an
overly
critical
judgment
of
a
job
applicant
because
of
the
way
he
or
she
dresses
or
talks
this
impression
could
lead
to
an
automatic
rejection
despite
the
applicant
s
potential
qualifications
and
good
character
in
this
case
our
first
impression
of
the
applicant
is
based
on
superficial
factors
and
does
not
truly
reflect
his
or
her
true
worth
although
first
impressions
are
difficult
to
avoid
we
can
learn
to
question
our
initial
thoughts
and
judgments
we
can
open
our
minds
to
multiple
perspectives
and
put
in
effort
to
get
to
know
someone
or
something
better
in
order
to
form
a
more
accurate
understanding
through
sustained
interactions
and
personal
experiences
we
can
revise
our
first
impressions
and
gain
a
more
realistic
picture
of
reality
thus
initial
impressions
are
not
always
reliable
and
can
be
changed
by
developing
a
deeper
level
of
understanding
it
is
important
to
recognize
our
own
weaknesses
in
forming
those
initial
impressions
and
take
the
initiative
to
revisit
our
assumptions
in
order
to
form
fair
and
accurate
judgments
learning
in
person
provides
numerous
benefits
to
students
such
as
the
opportunity
to
make
lasting
connections
with
peers
and
teachers
and
understand
complex
topics
more
deeply
attending
school
also
provides
students
with
valuable
life
experiences
that
they
can
draw
from
for
years
to
come
learning
has
various
advantages
as
well
such
as
the
ability
to
access
educational
resources
from
anywhere
with
an
internet
connection
the
ability
to
save
money
on
materials
and
the
ability
to
gain
insights
from
multiple
perspectives
while
there
are
many
advantages
to
online
learning
it
does
come
with
some
challenges
these
include
difficulty
connecting
with
classmates
and
instructors
lack
of
hands on
activities
and
less
personalized
instruction
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
have
both
advantages
and
drawbacks
on
the
positive
side
an
early
commitment
can
help
to
focus
your
education
and
give
you
an
impetus
to
work
hard
towards
your
chosen
goal
young
people
tend
to
be
particularly
energetic
and
motivated
and
so
can
focus
on
their
career
ambitions
early
on
however
committing
to
a
career
too
early
can
be
detrimental
to
personal
growth
you
may
miss
out
on
trying
new
activities
and
exploring
different
paths
furthermore
you
may
change
your
mind
as
you
get
older
and
find
it
harder
to
adjust
to
a
different
career
therefore
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
a
substantial
decision
and
it
is
important
to
carefully
consider
the
pros
and
cons
seeking
guidance
from
experts
can
be
a
great
way
of
making
important
life
decisions
advisers
and
mentors
especially
those
who
have
experienced
what
we
are
going
through
can
provide
invaluable
insight
and
advice
they
are
often
the
best
source
of
relevant
and
objective
advice
this
can
be
particularly
advantageous
to
those
facing
difficult
life
decisions
as
expert
guidance
can
help
to
identify
and
weigh
up
options
furthermore
having
someone
to
turn
to
when
looking
for
guidance
can
give
us
the
confidence
and
reassurance
we
need
to
make
a
decision
with
courage
and
conviction
it
can
also
be
beneficial
for
gaining
the
experience
and
knowledge
necessary
to
make
our
own
decisions
in
the
future
however
it
s
important
to
remember
that
in
some
cases
relying
on
someone
else
s
advice
can
limit
our
own
ability
to
think
independently
and
form
our
own
decisions
too
much
advice
and
guidance
can
make
it
difficult
to
develop
our
own
problem solving
skills
and
taken
too
far
this
could
be
detrimental
to
our
development
as
autonomous
individuals
additionally
in
some
cases
seeking
guidance
from
an
expert
can
leave
us
feeling
misguided
and
confused
if
their
advice
does
not
lead
us
in
the
right
direction
it
is
therefore
always
important
to
consider
the
merits
of
both
options
when
making
any
major
decision
in
life
people
should
make
their
own
decisions
because
it
gives
them
the
freedom
to
act
according
to
their
own
values
and
interests
when
people
make
their
own
decisions
they
take
responsibility
for
their
own
successes
and
failures
and
learn
to
live
with
the
consequences
of
their
choices
this
is
a
powerful
form
of
self empowerment
and
can
help
people
to
become
independent
and
confident
in
contrast
if
people
rely
on
others
to
make
decisions
for
them
they
surrender
any
control
they
might
have
they
become
dependent
and
are
likely
to
feel
powerless
and
frustrated
when
they
do
n t
get
what
they
want
making
their
own
decisions
allows
people
to
have
a
sense
of
ownership
over
their
life
and
gives
them
the
ability
to
direct
their
own
course
when
people
make
their
own
decisions
they
are
more
likely
to
come
up
with
solutions
that
are
right
for
them
instead
of
relying
on
the
judgment
of
others
they
are
free
to
evaluate
the
situation
from
their
own
perspective
and
find
the
best
solution
this
allows
them
to
create
a
life
that
meets
their
needs
and
goals
and
to
take
ownership
of
their
lives
in
a
meaningful
way
ultimately
making
their
own
decisions
gives
people
the
freedom
to
live
their
life
according
to
the
values
and
principles
that
they
believe
in
it
allows
them
to
move
forward
with
certainty
and
purpose
and
to
create
a
life
that
is
totally
unique
to
them
making
their
own
decisions
is
undoubtedly
the
best
way
for
people
to
take
control
of
their
destiny
and
live
a
life
of
fulfillment
in
recent
years
the
use
of
technology
and
digital
resources
have
influenced
how
people
interact
with
one
another
examples
such
as
and
have
become
more
commonplace
in
our
day to day
lives
making
it
increasingly
easy
to
influence
someone
without
having
to
use
physical
examples
however
there
are
still
many
other
ways
to
influence
someone
without
relying
on
examples
such
as
verbal
communication
and
body
language
verbal
communication
and
body
language
are
still
effective
means
for
conveying
thoughts
feelings
and
intentions
through
the
use
of
words
facial
expressions
and
gestures
people
can
easily
communicate
their
desires
to
one
another
without
being
constrained
by
the
need
to
provide
examples
or
visuals
even
when
someone
may
not
understand
the
language
of
the
speaker
these
other
forms
of
communication
can
still
serve
to
influence
while
technology
and
digital
resources
are
convenient
and
often
times
helpful
when
trying
to
influence
someone
they
should
not
be
relied
upon
as
the
only
means
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
considering
other
options
such
as
verbal
communication
and
body
language
as
the
impact
they
have
on
the
listener
should
not
be
trivialized
by
understanding
the
many
ways
in
which
we
can
influence
someone
we
can
better
equip
ourselves
with
the
knowledge
and
resources
needed
to
effectively
communicate
our
ideas
and
intentions
without
using
tangible
examples
graduating
early
can
be
a
great
opportunity
to
jumpstart
one
s
dream
job
or
start
college
earlier
completing
a
four year
program
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
is
a
testament
to
a
student
s
dedication
ambition
and
discipline
financially
graduating
early
can
mean
saving
money
on
tuition
and
room
and
board
fees
as
well
as
less
money
spent
on
textbooks
and
other
supplies
at
the
same
time
graduating
early
can
be
more
difficult
in
terms
of
academic
rigor
and
personal
challenge
not
only
does
it
require
taking
extra
classes
but
it
also
requires
more
intense
studying
time
and
a
more
disciplined
approach
to
course
selection
it
can
also
lead
to
a
feeling
of
academic
burnout
earlier
than
normal
when
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
graduating
early
it
is
important
for
each
individual
to
take
into
account
their
own
academic
and
financial
situation
as
well
as
their
own
feelings
of
academic
burnout
ultimately
each
student
should
decide
whether
graduating
early
is
the
appropriate
decision
for
them
graduating
early
does
not
necessarily
guarantee
a
better
education
than
the
standard
four year
plan
rather
each
student
should
choose
the
path
that
best
meets
their
individual
needs
and
goals
failure
can
be
a
great
teacher
even
when
it
has
a
discouraging
effect
in
the
short term
and
enthusiasm
are
essential
when
it
comes
to
turning
failure
into
success
having
a
positive
attitude
and
approach
to
life
will
make
it
easier
to
accept
setbacks
and
look
at
them
as
learning
opportunities
it
s
important
to
remember
that
failing
does
n t
mean
you
re
a
failure
mistakes
and
failure
are
part
of
the
process
of
growth
and
success
going
into
unfamiliar
territory
can
be
intimidating
but
having
enthusiasm
and
an
eagerness
to
learn
can
open
doors
and
make
it
much
easier
to
adjust
and
grow
for
example
let
s
say
you
re
starting
a
business
mistakes
are
unavoidable
but
instead
of
getting
discouraged
and
giving
up
embracing
failure
and
learning
from
it
can
open
up
opportunities
and
relationships
that
couldn
t
have
been
found
any
other
way
the
most
successful
entrepreneurs
will
often
talk
about
the
successes
that
came
from
failing
failing
fast
learning
from
their
mistakes
and
applying
that
knowledge
to
build
a
successful
business
in
conclusion
failure
and
success
are
not
mutually
exclusive
accepting
mistakes
and
having
an
eagerness
to
learn
from
them
can
often
be
the
key
to
achieving
success
failure
should
n t
be
feared
but
should
be
embraced
as
part
of
the
learning
process
that
ultimately
leads
to
success
growing
up
i
was
entranced
by
the
beautiful
sound
of
the
violin a
classical
instrument
which
has
been
in
existence
since
the
century
in
i
was
enchanted
by
the
complexity
and
range
of
emotion
that
the
instrument
could
convey
when
played
skillfully
as
i
conducted
research
into
the
instrument
s
history
i
developed
an
even
greater
appreciation
for
its
extraordinary
heritage
and
the
history
of
its
renowned
composers
i
eagerly
signed
up
for
violin
lessons
however
i
soon
realized
that
learning
to
play
the
violin
is
an
incredibly
taxing
process
that
requires
immense
dedication
time
and
focus
to
become
proficient
you
need
to
practice
regularly
in
order
to
ensure
that
you
can
play
the
instrument
comfortably
and
develop
both
musical
and
technical
skills
such
as
knowing
fingering
positions
posture
and
having
an
overall
command
of
the
instrument
s
sound
my
first
experiences
taking
violin
lessons
were
humbling
i
was
surrounded
by
much
more
experienced
and
knowledgeable
musicians
yet
the
teacher
was
patient
with
me
and
helped
me
gradually
become
more
comfortable
and
confident
with
the
instrument
despite
the
initial
difficulty
i
saw
firsthand
the
sheer
joy
of
mastering
a
new
piece
and
was
inspired
by
those
around
me
to
push
my
limits
and
strive
to
get
to
the
point
of
being
able
to
perform
confidently
at
the
same
time
i
realized
the
detrimental
consequences
of
not
practicing
regularly
neglecting
practice
can
lead
to
slipping
technical
ability
as
well
as
a
loss
of
confidence
and
motivation
through
this
experience
my
attitude
and
perspective
on
the
violin
shifted
from
a
source
of
struggle
to
a
place
of
peace
and
comfort
today
i
am
able
to
take
immense
joy
in
playing
the
violin
something
that
i
never
imagined
i
would
be
doing
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
essential
part
of
life
it
allows
us
to
make
the
best
of
every
situation
and
gives
us
the
strength
to
push
through
hardship
on
a
general
level
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
leads
to
greater
success

better
mental
and
physical
health

positive
attitude
within
the
home
has
the
ability
to
create
a
harmonious
and
vibrant
environment
in
which
family
relationships
can
flourish
i
once
had
a
coworker
who
has
a
consistently
positive
outlook
on
life
no
matter
how
challenging
a
situation
we
found
ourselves
in
his
attitude
made
the
job
easier
and
encouraged
teamwork
even
during
difficult
days
his
positivity
made
the
workplace
a
more
pleasant
atmosphere
leading
to
improved
morale
on
the
other
hand
lacking
a
positive
attitude
in
any
situation
can
have
dire
consequences
it
can
lead
to
unhappiness
stress
low
self esteem
and
negativity
that
can
spread
to
those
around
us
the
lack
of
a
positive
attitude
can
also
reduce
productivity
and
lead
to
a
lack
of
motivation
and
ambition
in
the
end
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
in
any
life
situation
and
its
importance
can
not
be
underestimated
staying
active
can
be
beneficial
in
helping
us
to
accomplish
our
goals
and
dreams
activities
are
important
in
gaining
knowledge
and

as
building
self esteem
and
confidence
having
an
active
life
can
also
help
us
push
ourselves
to
greater
heights
and
perserverance
is
key
to
achieving
our
goals
and
dreams
what
s
more
the
daily
activities
that
we
choose
to
engage
in
have
a
major
role
in
shaping
our
lives
they
help
us
develop
crucial
skills
and
provide
meaningful
relationships
with
others
additionally
the
choices
we
make
today
can
impact
our
outlook
for
the
future
as

it

important
to
stay
active
and
make
wise
decisions
in
order
to
lead
a
successful
life
the
debate
surrounding
online
learning
has
grown
in
recent
years
with
a
variety
of
countries
and
schools
considering
it
a
viable
educational
option
however
there
are
some
countries
and
schools
which
do
not
allow
online
learning
and
it
is
important
to
understand
the
consequences
students
face
as
a
result
technological
capabilities
in
some
of
these
countries
may
be
limited
which
could
be
a
contributing
factor
however
it
is
important
to
note
that
online
learning
is
not
a
viable
option
for
all
students
no
matter
the
technological
capabilities
of
the
countries
in
which
they
reside
the
benefits
of
online
learning
compared
to
traditional
in person
schooling
are
no
doubt
significant
learning
grants
students
much
greater
flexibility
and
allows
them
to
engage
in
educational
pursuits
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
additionally
online
learning
is
often
less
costly
than
traditional
in person
schooling
since
there
are
no
geographic
boundaries
and
students
have
access
to
a
much
larger
variety
of
courses
however
online
learning
does
come
with
its
fair
share
of
disadvantages
students
in
traditional
schooling
benefit
greatly
from
the
social
interaction
with
their
peers
something
which
is
not
easily
replicated
in
an
online
environment
despite
the
advances
in
technology
the
technological
equipment
required
for
an
optimal
online
learning
experience
is
often
quite
expensive
some
students
may
not
take
the
online
education
seriously
and
be
less
likely
to
put
in
the
appropriate
effort
needed
for
success
finally
it
is
important
to
note
that
online
learning
can
have
many
positive
outcomes
for
those
who
are
unable
to
attend
school
due
to
illness
or
other
extenuating
circumstances
these
individuals
can
still
take
part
in
educational
pursuits

convenience
of

offers
a

known
to
have
a
strong
optimistic
outlook
which
is
often
argued
to
be
one
of
the
key
contributors
to
his
success
at
the
same
time
many
argue
that
there
is
no
single
key
to
success
and
it
is
more
important
to
focus
on
skills
and
hard
work
than
attitude
or
outlook
there
are
countless
unreliable
biographies
for
example
of
famous
people
claiming
to
have
an
unattainable
positive
outlook
that
was
responsible

their
success
ultimately
having

attitude
is
important
for

it

not
the
only
factor
it
can
help
in
certain
ways
like
fostering
a
healthy
self esteem
and
helping
build
healthy
and
supportive
relationships
but
it
can
not
entirely
replace

the

of
these
elements
playing

essential
for

experience
from

days

indoor
court
the
ideal
temperature
for
playing
basketball
is
usually
around
to
degrees
as
any
higher
or
lower
can
affect
gameplay
times
of
the
year
that
are
most
suitable
for
basketball
are
generally
during
the
summer
months
when
the
weather
is
warmest
and
outdoor
courts
are
in
optimal
condition
in
addition
to
comfortable
weather
having
the
necessary
equipment
for

along

without

need
of

famously

mastering
a
skill
as
part
of
the
process
of
self improvement
and
growth
is
essential
of
a
skill
whether
related
to
a
profession
or
not
can
lead
to
immense
personal
and
professional
growth
for
instance
investing
a
significant
amount
of
time
to
learning
a
new
language
as
a
hobby
has
unlocked
a
wide
range
of
opportunities
for
me
personally
it
has
opened
up
new
job
prospects
made
me
more
marketable
for
employers
and
enabled
me
to
move
in
more
global
circles
similarly
learning
a
complex
craft
such
as
knitting
or
woodworking
provided
me
with
a
sense
of
personal
satisfaction
and
increased
confidence
however
growth
is
not

to
mastering
a
skill
it
is
possible
for
someone
to
become
a

more
self aware
individual
and
grow
without
mastering
any
particular
skill
gates
echoes
this
sentiment
and
states
it
s
fine
to
celebrate
success
but
it
is
more
important
to
heed
the
lessons
of
failure
learning
what
not
to
do
is
sometimes
more
important
than
learning
what
to

graduating
high
school
in
three
years
and
entering
college
or
the
work
force
one
year
early
is
an
increasingly
popular
option
amongst
students
by
putting
in
the
effort
to
bypass
traditional
high
school
curriculums
students
are
able
to
enter
college
or
the
work
force
at
an
earlier
age
thereby
giving
them
a
head
start
over
those
who
are
the
same
age
but
stuck
in
high
school
for
the
standard
four
years
in
terms
of
the
effort
required
to
achieve
this
goal
the
most
important
is
to
be
organized
and
dedicated
early
grads
need
to
stay
focused
and
be
willing
to
take
more
courses
in
any
given
semester
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
time
they
may
also
need
to
be
flexible
in
their
approach
to
the
different
classes
they
take
and
take
online
or
other
external
classes
to
fully
fill
out
the
requirements
the
advantages
of
graduating
early
are
manifold
firstly
students
are
able
to
enter
college
or
the
job
market
one
year
early
this
means
they
are
more
likely
to
secure
a
well paying
job
and
also
have
the
opportunity
to
advance
more
quickly
in
their
career
furthermore
since
many
college
credits
can
be
earned
at
the
high
school
level
early
grads
may
be
able
to
take
on
full time
college
courses
during
their
first
year
of
college
this
could
potentially
save
them
a
significant
amount
of
money
since
they
would
not
have
to
spend
the
full
four
years
of
college
tuition
thus
it
is
clear
that
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
and
entering
college
or
the
work
force
one
year
early
can
be
a
beneficial
decision
for
motivated
and
organized
students
the
payoff
of
being
able
to
enter
college
or
the
job
market
more
quickly
is
likely
to
outweigh
the
effort
required
to
achieve
this
goal
leading
to
a
more
successful
future
first
impressions
are
often
crucial
in
forming
relationships
and
opinions
we
make
snap
judgements
believing
that
our
initial
thoughts
about
new
acquaintances
are
accurate
as
if
our
minds
were
solely
made
up
shortly
after
meeting
someone
however
throughout
the
course
of
a
relationship
these
first
impressions
can
and
usually
do
change
over
time
take
for
instance
my
experience
with
my
former
neighbor
when
i
first
moved
to
the
area
i
had
no
clue
who
lived
in
the
house
next
to
me
several
weeks
later
i
finally
mustered
up
the
courage
to
introduce
myself
and
to
my
surprise
my
neighbor
was
not
the
snobby
person
i
had
labeled
her
as
from
afar
to
find
out
she
was
a
kind
outgoing
woman
and
we
quickly
became
friends
i
was
so
taken
aback
by
the
difference
in
my
preconceived
notions
that
i
began
to
ponder
the
power
of
first
impressions
we
often
have
wonderful
experiences
from
second
chances
such
as
when
we
return
to
a
restaurant
after
having
a
bad
time
the
first
in
the
case
of
the
aforementioned
restaurant
the
second
time
around
the
waiter
was
a
lot
friendlier
the
food
was
much
tastier
and
the
ambiance
was
a
lot
more
pleasant
this
serves
as
a
reminder
that
while
it
s
important
to
go
into
a
situation
with
an
open
mind
it
s
not
always
wise
to
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
the
idea
of
first
impressions
can
be
beneficial
in
the
sense
that
it
gives
us
the
opportunity
of
keeping
an
open
mind
regarding
people
and
places
for
instance
i
would
have
never
connected
with
my
neighbor
had
i
stayed
within
the
confines
of
my
own
presumptions
regarding
her
furthermore
my
second time
visit
to
the
restaurant
provided
me
with
a
great
night
out
and
i
now
consider
it
one
of
my
favorite
spots
overall
our
initial
thoughts
of
new
acquaintances
places
and
experiences
are
important
however
they
don
t
always
tell
the
entire
story
and
thus
it
s
important
to
remember
that
first
impressions
can
and
do
change
over
time
offering
us
the
chance
to
benefit
from
second
chances
in
today
s
ever changing
world
student
community
service
should
be
mandatory
in
the
school
setting
in
order
to
provide
our
young
people
with
the
opportunity
to
make
a
lasting
positive
impact
on
their
communities
studies
have
shown
that
student
community
service
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
student
learning
teacher
effectiveness
student
engagement
and
the
overall
environment
of
the
community
community
service
can
help
give
students
a
better
understanding
of
the
world
around
them
being
exposed
to
situations
outside
one
s
classroom
gives
students
a
real world
understanding
of
how
to
apply
their
knowledge
and
skills
this
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
their
learning
as
research
has
shown
that
those
who
are
involved
in
community
service
and
volunteering
are
more
likely
to
stay
in
school
and
become
successful
adults
later
in
life
teachers
can
also
benefit
from
requiring
their
students
to
participate
in
voluntary
services
it
allows
them
to
get
out
of
the
classroom
and
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
issues
and
needs
that
exist
in
their
community
by
doing
so
they
are
able
to
better
equip
their
students
with
the
skills
and
tools
to
serve
their
community
in
meaningful
and
impactful
ways
student
engagement
is
also
improved
when
they
are
given
the
opportunity
to
take
part
in
voluntary
service
studies
have
found
that
students
who
are
engaged
in
service
activities
tend
to
have
higher
are
more
likely
to
graduate
and
are
more
likely
to
be
successful
in
college
and
in
the
workforce
finally
student
community
service
has
been
found
to
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
overall
environment
of
the
community
when
students
get
involved
in
the
community
they
are
more
likely
to
be
engaged
in
civic
life
leading
to
increased
understanding
and
appreciation
of
diversity
this
in
turn
has
been
linked
to
reduced
violence
improved
economic
development
and
increased
social
connectedness
in
conclusion
student
community
service
should
be
mandated
in
the
school
setting
in
order
to
create
more
meaningful
opportunities
for
students
teachers
and
the
community
at
large
to
do
good
and
be
successful
by
requiring
student
service
we
can
tap
into
the
potential
of
our
youth
to
create
change
and
make
a
lasting
difference
in
our
communities
in
recent
years
taking
courses
online
from
home
has
become
increasingly
popular
for
many
students
studying
from
home
has
numerous
benefits
that
may
make
it
better
suited
to
certain
individuals
than
attending
school
in
person
for
starters
online
courses
offer
convenience
and
flexibility
those
with
physical
impairments
or
other
long term
health
issues
can
participate
in
classes
without
having
to
worry
about
getting
to
and
from
school
additionally
there
is
often
more
variety
when
it
comes
to
what
courses
are
available
online
for
students
who
may
be
struggling
academically
online
courses
allow
for
a
more
individualized
learning
experience
and
can
provide
extra
help
when
needed
however
there
are
also
some
clear
advantages
to
attending
school
in
person
in
a
regular
school
environment
students
get
the
opportunity
to
learn
social
skills
and
work
with
classmates
on
group
projects
interacting
with
peers
and
teachers
on
a
daily
basis
can
be
beneficial
for
developing
important
skills
like
collaboration
communication
and
problem solving
additionally
attending
school
in
person
can
provide
a
sense
of
routine
and
can
create
a
more
rewarding
educational
experience
by
taking
part
in
classroom
discussions
and
physical
activities
students
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
material
they
are
studying
ultimately
there
is
no
one size fits all
solution
when
it
comes
to
deciding
between
online
courses
and
in person
education
it
is
important
to
consider
both
options
seriously
and
factor
in
each
student
s
individual
abilities
and
preferences
some
may
find
that
taking
courses
online
from
home
is
a
better
fit
while
others
may
prefer
the
traditional
school
experience
for
those
looking
to
be
successful
in
multiple
careers
research
is
essential
it
takes
a
lot
of
effort
to
learn
the
skills
needed
and
stay
on
top
of
ever changing
trends
within
each
industry
in
addition
to
research
a
practical
way
to
gain
the
necessary
skills
is
to
try
a
recipe
or
activity
that
you
have
never
done
before
and
practice
it
to
perfect
your
skills
experimenting
with
new
things
can
often
increase
our
self confidence
because
we
gain
a
sense
of
accomplishment
in
learning
something
new
exploring
and
learning
new
activities
can
also
help
increase
our
knowledge
and
grow
our
skill
sets
additionally
failure
can
be
seen
as
a
learning
opportunity
where
we
can
take
something
away
from
the
experience
while
gaining
the
confidence
to
attempt
such
endeavours
again
by
studying
the
experiences
of
someone
with
multiple
careers
it
is
possible
to
take
away
valuable
information
on
how
they
managed
to
move
between
each
different
career
and
succeed
this
knowledge
can
then
be
used
to
develop
and
form
our
own
career
plan
nevertheless
it
is
essential
to
remember
the
importance
of
research
and
the
willingness
to
experience
something
new
in
order
to
be
successful
in
multiple
careers
asking
for
advice
from
multiple
people
when
faced
with
challenging
decisions
or
struggles
in
life
can
be
beneficial
for
anyone
not
only
does
it
give
the
individual
a
broader
range
of
perspectives
to
consider
but
it
also
helps
to
boost
self confidence
having
the
support
and
guidance
from
others
can
be
an
invaluable
resource
and
give
someone
in
need
the
assurance
that
their
problems
are
being
taken
seriously
opening
up
the
dialogue
with
a
variety
of
people
also
encourages
the
individual
to
be
more
candid
and
honest
about
their
thoughts
and
feelings
leading
to
more
holistic
decision making
ultimately
seeking
advice
from
multiple
people
when
faced
with
difficulties
can
make
the
journey
easier
and
more
fulfilling
graduating
high
school
early
can
be
a
beneficial
decision
for
some
students
as
it
can
open
up
more
opportunities
to
gain
experiences
and
explore
alternative
career
paths students
can
use
the
extra
time
to
take
classes
or
participate
in
activities
that
help
them
achieve
their
career
goals
additionally
completing
high
school
early
will
allow
students
to
take
on
a
heavier
workload
as
they
transition
to
college
or
other
postsecondary
education
earlier
however
graduating
high
school
early
does
come
with
its
own
set
of
risks
it
can
place
additional
stress
and
workload
on
students
who
are
taking
on
classes
before
they
are
fully
prepared
and
the
transition
to
college
without
the
full
scope
of
a
high
school
education
can
cause
difficulty
in
adapting
to
the
new
environment
additionally
students
may
miss
out
on
certain
activities
or
experiences
that
could
help
them
in
the
long
run
one
of
the
greatest
gifts
life
has
given
me
is
the
wisdom
of
my
family
my
parents
and
my
sister
have
been
giving
me
advice
since
i
was
a
young
child
and
the
lessons
they
shared
with
me
have
served
me
well
throughout
my
life
my
mom
has
always
told
me
to
never
give
up
no
matter
what
situation
i
face
she
taught
me
that
hard
work
and
perseverance
will
always
pay
off
and
to
never
be
discouraged
by
failure
i
ve
seen
the
power
of
this
advice
in
my
own
life
time
and
again
whenever
i
ve
faced
a
challenge
i
ve
never
hesitated
to
keep
going
my
dad
s
wisdom
lies
in
showing
me
the
value
of
gratitude
he
taught
me
to
always
be
grateful
even
when
life
does
n t
seem
to
be
going
my
way
i
try
to
remind
myself
of
this
during
the
toughest
of
times
and
it
always
brings
me
back
to
a
place
of
appreciation
my
sister
has
perhaps
the
most
meaningful
advice
of
all
to
always
be
true
to
myself
growing
up
surrounded
by
expectations
it
was
often
hard
to
decipher
what
exactly
was
true
to
me
but
my
sister
s
words
of
wisdom
are
something
i
cling
to
and
i
remind
myself
of
them
whenever
i
find
myself
struggling
with
making
the
right
decision
the
wisdom
of
my
family
has
been
with
me
since
i
was
young
and
shapes
my
outlook
on
life
even
today
i
m
so
grateful
to
have
a
support
system
i
can
turn
to
in
times
of
need
and
the
advice
i
ve
been
given
will
continue
to
be
a
driving
force
in
my
life
for
years
to
come
although
a
average
may
not
seem
like
an
impressive
academic
achievement
it
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
potential
of
the
student
in
fact
some
students
with
a
c
average
can
achieve
great
success
if
given
the
opportunity
for
these
students
extra
help
and
a
chance
to
take
part
in
activities
can
be
especially
beneficial
with
the
agreement
of
the
student
parents
and
teachers
these
activities
may
include
extra
tutoring
field
trips
and
group
projects
these
types
of
activities
can
help
these
students
learn
the
necessary
skills
they
need
to
succeed
in
school
for
example
a
field
trip
can
open
new
doors
of
knowledge
while
a
group
project
can
help
the
student
learn
how
to
collaborate
effectively
extra
tutoring
can
also
show
the
student
new
subject
materials
or
help
them
bolster
their
understanding
of
a
certain
topic
as
a
result
a
student
with
a
average
should
at
least
have
extra
help
and
should
be
allowed
to
partake
in
activities
with
the
agreement
of
the
student
parents
and
teachers
these
activities
can
be
an
enlightening
and
empowering
journey
that
can
help
the
student
reach
their
academic
goals
praising
students
when
their
work
has
not
yet
reached
its
full
potential
has
both
positive
and
negative
implications
on
the
one
hand
praising
students
for
their
effort
can
boost
their
self confidence
and
encourage
them
to
persist
in
the
face
of
disappointment
it
can
also
serve
as
a
way
of
rewarding
a
student
for
engagement
with
the
task
regardless
of
outcome
on
the
other
hand
praise
which
is
given
too
freely
can
result
in
students
forming
the
belief
that
hollow
compliments
will
be
rewarded
instead
of
hard
work
it
can
also
lead
to
unrealistic
expectations
about
performance
creating
a
false
sense
of
confidence
which
will
inevitably
be
crushed
in
the
face
of
more
significant
challenges
when
used
in
moderation
however
praising
students
for
effort
can
be
beneficial
rather
than
expecting
students
to
always
achieve
an
grade
recognizing
worthy
effort
helps
to
foster
a
growth
mindset
enabling
students
to
realize
that
mistakes
and
failures
are
part
of
the
learning
process
it
also
encourages
positive
self reflection
with
students
becoming
more
self aware
and
mindful
of
the
work
that
has
been
put
in
overall
it
is
clear
that
praising
students
for
their
efforts
even
when
their
work
has
not
reached
its
full
potential
is
a
delicate
balance
used
constructively
it
can
motivate
and
reward
but
overused
it
can
create
excessive
expectations
and
detract
from
meaningful
learning
the
world
is
a
complex
place
and
oftentimes
there
is
no
better
guide
through
life
than
a
loving
parent
or
guardian
throughout
our
lives
as
we
experience
the
highs
and
lows
of
life
wisdom
and
experience
from
those
who
have
gone
before
us
can
be
invaluable
for
this
reason
it
is
important
to
obtain
wisdom
and
experience
from
a
parent
or
guardian
for
the
younger
generation
the
guidance
of
a
parent
or
guardian
can
help
them
make
wise
decisions
especially
during
times
of
adversity
with
practical
wisdom
and
life
experience
these
mentors
can
help
advise
through
difficult
decisions from
the
small
but
significant
ones
in
teenage
life
such
as
career
choices
to
the
bigger
life
decisions
such
as
sorting
out
relationships
and
financial
management
finally
as
children
become
adults
having
someone
with
experience
to
act
as
a
sounding
board
to
discuss
career
opportunities
sports
social
situations
and
relationships
can
be
key
to
making
wise
choices
a
parent
or
guardian
who
is
wise
and
experienced
can
help
a
young
adult
tap
into
their
strengths
and
teach
them
how
to
find
and
develop
wisdom
to
sum
up
wisdom
and
experience
from
a
parent
or
guardian
can
be
invaluable
while
a
young
person
might
be
more
independent
those
with
parents
or
guardians
to
help
guide
them
on
their
journey
will
have
a
much
greater
chance
of
success
and
fulfillment
in
life
sports
activities
are
an
essential
part
of
physical
and
mental
development
in
young
people
unfortunately
access
to
these
activities
is
often
limited
when
students
are
required
to
achieve
a
certain
grade
in
order
to
participate
this
is
an
unfair
practice
for
several
reasons
it
sets
up
a
false
dichotomy
between
academics
and
athletics
an
artificial
separation
that
should
not
exist
students
should
be
encouraged
to
excel
in
both
areas
sports
in
particular
can
foster
resilience
and
provide
a
constructive
outlet
for
frustration
or
disappointment
with
academic
performance
using
grades
to
limit
athletics
unfairly
disadvantages
those
students
who
are
already
at
a
disadvantage
the
flip
side
of
this
coin
is
that
students
who
already
excel
in
academics
are
given
extra
incentive
to
keep
up
their
performance
while
students
who
struggle
are
left
behind
and
most
importantly
sports
activities
help
young
people
develop
lifelong
skills
and
friendships
these
experiences
should
not
be
denied
to
students
based
on
one
area
of
performance
is
an
essential
part
of
holistic
education
and
too
often
we
forget
to
think
of
it
as
such
for
these
reasons
it
is
highly
unfair
to
limit
access
to
sports
based
on
grade
requirements
it
is
our
job
as
educators
to
ensure
that
all
students
have
equal
opportunity
to
participate
technology
has
profoundly
impacted
humanity
in
positive
ways
throughout
the
years
from
the
development
of
modern
medicine
to
providing
an
easier
means
of
communication
and
transportation
technology
has
significantly
changed
our
lifestyle
for
the
better
one
major
example
of
this
is
in
the
healthcare
industry
the
advancements
of
technology
have
allowed
medical
professionals
to
deliver
treatments
with
a
greater
level
of
accuracy
speed
and
efficiency
than
ever
before
for
example
the
use
of
automated
machines
for
patient
diagnostics
and
surgical
robots
has
allowed
for
a
more
precise
and
detailed
diagnosis
compared
to
older
traditional
methods
this
in
turn
not
only
saves
critical
time
and
resources
but
also
provides
a
better
standard
of
care
for
patients
worldwide
not
only
does
technology
improve
our
lifestyle
but
it
also
supports
knowledge
and
education
with
the
advent
of
the
internet
access
to
vast
amounts
of
information
is
now
literally
at
our
fingertips
the
internet
has
made
it
easier
than
ever
before
to
access
information
from
across
the
globe
allowing
students
and
researchers
to
broaden
their
understanding
and
learn
from
the
collective
knowledge
of
our
species
last
but
not
least
technology
has
a
major
impact
on
our
economy
with
the
use
of
technology
businesses
no
longer
have
to
rely
solely
on
manual
labor
for
their
operations
automation
has
allowed
businesses
to
increase
their
productivity
and
efficiency
in
an
incredibly
cost effective
manner
and
the
use
of
technology
has
had
a
major
impact
on
how
we
conduct
business
on
a
global
scale
in
conclusion
technology
has
had
innumerable
positive
effects
on
humanity
it
has
improved
our
lifestyle
supported
knowledge
and
had
a
major
impact
on
our
economy
we
can
only
imagine
what
the
future
holds
in
store
for
us
with
advancements
in
technology
we
set
out
together
as
a
group
to
explore
the
ways
the
natural
phenomena
of
wind
the
solar
system
and
the
moon
affect
us
we
conducted
extensive
research
developed
experiments
with
different
chemicals
and
repeated
each
of
the
experiments
multiple
times
to
ensure
accuracy
and
consistency
in
our
results
with
the
knowledge
we
gained
from
our
research
and
experiments
we
created
our
project
and
presented
it
to
our
peers
through
this
process
we
showed
our
collective
understanding
and
ability
to
work
effectively
and
collaboratively
as
a
group
no
one
has
ever
achieved
success
without
making
some
mistakes
along
the
way
failure
and
setbacks
are
part
of
life
and
how
we
respond
to
them
can
often
determine
our
final
success
history
is
full
of
examples
of
people
who
have
had
to
overcome
failure
and
struggle
in
order
to
achieve
their
goals
take
the
example
of
though
he
had
faced
numerous
setbacks
throughout
his
lifetime
he
never
gave
up
and
eventually
achieved
s
independence
from
in
his
refusal
to
accept
failure
and
continued
perseverance
eventually
led
to
his
success
another
inspiring
example
is
that
of
who
won
two
despite
facing
significant
gender based
obstacles
she
overcame
numerous
failures
throughout
her
life
and
ultimately
achieved
tremendous
success
due
to
her
persistence
and
unwavering
determination
her
story
highlights
how
no
amount
of
failure
should
ever
hold
someone
back
from
their
dreams
these
examples
show
that
failure
can
actually
be
a
key
driver
towards
success
it
can
provide
invaluable
lessons
and
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
the
most
successful
people
in
the
world
have
likely
faced
numerous
failures
throughout
their
lives
but
their
willingness
to
take
risks
and
never
give
up
has
ultimately
enabled
them
to
lead
happy
and
successful
lives
it
s
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
failure
is
never
an
excuse
for
giving
up
but
instead
it
should
be
seen
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
grow
and
ultimately
reach
success
it
was
time
for
and
to
decide
which
park
to
visit
they
discussed
the
different
parks
and
eventually
arrived
at
a
decision
through
a
vote
once
the
decision
was
finalized
they
immediately
started
to
figure
out
the
details
who
was
going
to
bring
the
camera
who
was
going
to
take
the
photos
they
assigned
tasks
and
made
sure
to
be
mindful
of
the
time
planning
activities
to
do
once
they
got
to
the
park
excited
for
the
adventure
ahead
the
five
friends
set
out
on
their
journey
as
someone
who
has
experienced
failure
on
numerous
occasions
i
must
say
i
agree
with
s
statement
that
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
with
loss
of
enthusiasm
throughout
my
life
i
have
learned
that
every
time
i
have
faced
a
difficult
challenge
or
failed
at
something
i
have
become
a
stronger
and
more
resilient
person
each
failure
has
provided
me
with
the
tools
and
experiences
necessary
to
better
persevere
and
face
the
next
challenge
for
example
in
high
school
i
applied
to
college
and
was
rejected
although
it
was
n t
what
i
wanted
at
the
time
the
experience
taught
me
that
failure
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
instead
i
applied
to
more
schools
studied
harder
and
took
on
more
extracurricular
activities
in
the
end
i
was
accepted
to
my
dream
school
and
graduated
with
honors
all
of
this
is
to
say
that
failure
is
an
integral
part
of
life
and
if
accepted
and
embraced
can
be
turned
into
success
most
of
my
successes
have
been
a
result
of
my
ability
to
keep
pushing
forward
despite
my
many
failures
and
lack
of
enthusiasm
i
learned
the
importance
of
adapting
to
changing
circumstances
and
developing
a
positive
attitude
in
order
to
achieve
my
goals
which
is
why
i
agree
with
s
statement
that
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
with
loss
of
enthusiasm
completing
high
school
earlier
than
the
traditional
age
of
or
can
offer
many
benefits
both
professionally
and
personally
for
those
who
opt
to
complete
their
secondary
education
at
a
younger
age
they
will
have
access
to
an
array
of
longer
professional
fields
to
explore
and
potentially
even
establish
themselves
within
sooner
than
their
peers
this
could
be
in
fields
such
as
entrepreneurship
coding
web
development
project
management
analytics
or
consulting
the
early
completion
of
high
school
will
also
open
up
the
doors
to
more
personal
opportunities
as
a
young
adult
there
are
many
opportunities
for
travel
volunteer
work
internships
apprenticeships
or
even
higher
education
to
pursue
young
allows
the
individual
more
freedom
to
explore
and
do
more
in
life
additionally
younger
adults
are
physically
stronger
and
more
resilient
allowing
them
to
take
on
more
physically demanding
jobs
once
famously
said
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
this
statement
epitomizes
the
importance
of
individuality
in
life
as
it
lays
out
the
struggles
of
being
oneself
in
a
world
full
of
people
trying
to
conform
you
to
their
expectations
my
own
personal
experience
helps
me
understand
this
statement
especially
in
my
teenage
years
with
the
stress
of
school
and
navigating
social
relationships
i
found
myself
trying
to
fit
into
what
everyone
else
expected
of
me
but
i
quickly
learned
that
nothing
was
worth
compromising
my
own
individual
values
and
desires
for
by
making
decisions
that
reflected
my
own
individualistic
preferences
i
gained
a
sense
of
peace
and
self confidence
ultimately
it
is
important
to
stay
true
to
oneself
in
spite
of
the
world
around
them
while
it
can
be
difficult
it
is
essential
if
we
want
to
enjoy
a
meaningful
fulfilling
journey
through
life
knowing
who
we
are
and
standing
up
for
our
individualistic
values
will
allow
us
to
achieve
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
personal
satisfaction
online
classes
offer
many
advantages
to
taking
traditional
classes
in
a
physical
school
building
one
major
positive
of
taking
online
classes
is
that
you
can
attend
them
from
anywhere
in
the
world
you
don
t
need
to
physically
be
in
the
same
place
as
your
instructor
to
get
help
or
to
learn
additionally
with
online
classes
you
have
the
ability
to
reach
out
for
help
at
any
time
and
you
can
pause
or
rewind
lessons
if
needed
taking
an
online
class
also
leaves
you
with
more
time
to
focus
on
other
activities
that
may
not
be
related
to
study
on
the
other
hand
attending
a
physical
school
offers
the
ability
to
interact
with
a
group
of
peers
and
the
instructor
in
a
way
that
is
not
possible
in
an
online
environment
in
this
environment
you
have
the
opportunity
to
build
close
relationships
with
teachers
and
classmates
by
having
face to face
conversations
growing
together
through
discussions
and
participating
in
interesting
activities
additionally
attending
a
physical
school
allows
for
in person
help
so
you
can
get
direct
feedback
from
teachers
if
you
are
having
difficulty
understanding
something
as
a
result
attending
a
physical
school
allows
for
fostering
long term
relationships
that
can
benefit
a
student
s
learning
experience
though
each
option
has
its
own
advantages
it
s
important
to
take
these
factors
into
consideration
when
deciding
between
taking
online
classes
or
attending
a
physical
school
failure
is
a
common
occurrence
and
one
that
everyone
must
learn
to
accept
while
there
is
a
risk
associated
with
failure
it
is
important
for
people
to
understand
that
they
can
find
a
way
to
turn
failure
into
success
one
way
to
do
this
is
to
stay
motivated
and
focus
on
the
positive
aspects
of
the
situation
people
should
focus
on
the
growth
that
is
achieved
by
learning
from
their
mistakes
and
discovering
creative
solutions
to
the
challenges
they
face
however
there
are
certain
drawbacks
associated
with
this
process
for
example
failure
can
be
emotionally
taxing
and
the
journey
from
failure
to
success
can
be
long
and
difficult
in
addition
it
can
require
significant
effort
and
there
is
no
guarantee
that
success
will
be
achieved
in
conclusion
for
those
people
who
are
looking
to
find
a
path
from
failure
to
success
it
is
important
to
stay
motivated
and
take
risks
by
maintaining
a
positive
mindset
and
being
willing
to
learn
from
mistakes
individuals
can
overcome
failure
and
achieve
the
success
they
strive
for
in
recent
years
more
and
more
young
people
are
choosing
to
commit
to
a
career
at
a
very
young
age
examples
of
successful
people
who
committed
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
seen
in
individuals
such
as
who
at
the
age
of
founded
the
social
networking
site
while
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
have
a
positive
impact
it
is
important
to
understand
that
not
everyone
is
suited
for
committing
to
a
career
at
such
a
young
age
further
there
are
examples
of
those
who
have
decided
to
slow
down
their
career
pursuits
and
wait
until
later
in
life
achieving
success
in
a
different
manner
ultimately
commitment
to
a
career
and
deciding
to
follow
a
certain
path
is
an
individual
choice
and
should
be
based
on
trust
in
one
s
own
abilities
those
who
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
tend
to
have
opportunities
to
gain
experience
and
are
able
to
focus
more
clearly
on
their
career
goals
in
the
process
and
in
yourself
can
lead
to
career
success
regardless
of
when
you
decide
to
commit
to
your
chosen
profession
ultimately
it
is
important
to
understand
that
making
a
decisions
on
when
to
commit
to
a
career
is
personal
and
should
be
made
with
thoughtful
consideration
and
research
after
careful
consideration
of
the
potential
benefits
and
risks
it
is
clear
that
implementing
an
afterschool
homework
club
could
have
far reaching
consequences
for
students
teachers
and
parents
on
the
one
hand
the
motivation
that
comes
with
the
dedication
to
completing
homework
in
a
supportive
academic
environment
could
significantly
improve
student
grades
and
attendance
improved
academic
performance
could
also
lead
to
increased
self confidence
in
students
which
could
be
beneficial
in
other
aspects
of
their
lives
on
the
other
hand
the
implementation
of
an
afterschool
homework
club
could
be
a
strain
on
resources
and
staff
leading
to
increased
pressure
on
teachers
and
additional
stress
for
parents
who
may
be
finding
difficulty
managing
their
already
tight
schedule
it
is
essential
to
carefully
weigh
all
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
any
decisions
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
has
many
advantages
for
one
those
who
are
younger
often
have
the
capacity
to
learn
faster
meaning
that
they
can
get
ahead

preparations
sooner
the
mental
and
knowledge
preparation
that
is
a
part
of
committing
to
a

age
is
also
one
of
its
benefits
as

will
have
the
time
to
explore
different
career
options
and
become
properly
informed
of
what
the
job
will
entail
on
the
other
hand
students
who
do

want
to
commit
to

young
age
may
find
themselves
with
a
disadvantage
later

can
be
a
challenging
process
we
must
have
the
courage
to
move
past
fear
and
laziness
and
push
ourselves
to
create
and
strive
for
short
and
long term
goals
it
is
important
to
find
ways
to
take
control
of
our
mindsets
dealing
with
self doubt
as
well
as
any
negative
criticism
or
judgment
from
others
additionally
we
need
to
develop
effective
strategies
to
motivate
ourselves
and
hold
ourselves
accountable
for
our
goals
to
do
this
we
must
focus
on
creating
an
environment
that
is
conducive
to
progress
and
success
instead
of
allowing
ourselves
to
be
held
back
by
excuses
or
excuses
once
we
have
identified
effective
methods
of
setting
and
achieving
goals
we
can
focus
on
developing
resilient
mentalities
that
will
allow
us
to
attain

if
they

a
ride
home
or
in
case
of
an

in

to
avoid

teachers
should
set
clear

for
when

are
allowed
to
use
their

phones
may
only
be
used
during

teachers
should
also
enforce
consequences
if
rules
are
broken
such
as
temporary
removal
of
the
device
on
the
other
hand
students
need
to
take
responsibility
for

it
should
go
without
saying
that
they
should
abide
by
school
policies
and
not

was
a
statesman

and
influential
philosopher
he
served
as
the
third
president
of
the
states
of
and
was
instrumental
in
shaping
the
early
years
of
the
nation
his
most
notable
accomplishment
was
the
passage
of
the
of
which
laid
out
the
fundamental
principles
of
freedom
and
justice
that
guide
our
nation
today
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
power
of
education
and
the
importance
of
improving
society
through
science
and
technology
his
commitment
to
personal
liberty
and
the
free
exchange
of
ideas
inspired
countless
reformers
to
pursue
similar
ideals
he
famously
stated
it
is
never
too
late
to
form
the
habits
of
a
good
life
his
commitment
to
this
philosophy
has
been
credited
with
inspiring
individuals
to
strive
for
greatness
and
work
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
s
beliefs
and
accomplishments
still
serve
as
invaluable
lessons
for
today
he
encouraged
people
to
think
critically
challenge
norms
and
strive
for
progress
in
an
ever changing
world
his
forward thinking
ideals
are
still
applicable
and
are
a
reminder
of
how
a
single
individual
can
make
a
lasting
impact
on
society
one
of
the
primary
advantages
of
taking
a
three year
high
school
program
is
that
it
allows
students
to
finish
their
secondary
education
a
year
earlier
this
can
lead
to
a
variety
of
benefits
such
as
getting
started
on
college
a
year
earlier
entering
the
workforce
sooner
or
taking
a
gap
year
and
traveling
this
can
be
extremely
advantageous
for
those
who
wish
to
move
forward
with
their
lives
as
quickly
as
possible
however
taking
a
three year
high
school
program
can
be
quite
challenging
students
may
find
themselves
needing
to
make
more
difficult
or
complex
decisions
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
and
struggle
to
keep
up
with
the
faster
pace
of
the
program
some
courses
or
extracurricular
activities
may
not
be
available
in
the
three year
format
which
could
be
a
major
issue
to
those
who
are
looking
for
specific
activities
or
pursue
a
certain
educational
track
distance
learning
can
provide
students
with
a
valuable
educational
experience
that
can
be
tailored
to
their
individual
needs
offering
a
range
of
benefits
that
the
traditional
classroom
setting
can
not
one
of
the
key
advantages
of
distance
learning
is
that
it
frees
students
from
the
physical
and
social
pressures
that
can
be
found
in
a
classroom
setting
without
the
traditional
classroom
environment
students
can
avoid
the
peer
pressure
judgment
and
discouragement
that
can
be
experienced
in
an
academic
context
in
addition
the
lack
of
physical
presence
can
also
reduce
the
potential
for
cheating
by
providing
a
secure
environment
where
all
students
have
equal
access
to
resources
furthermore
distance
learning
offers
a
scalable
form
of
education
that
can
be
easily
accessible
to
students
regardless
of
geographic
location
allowing
students
to
continue
their
studies
without
worrying
about
their
ability
to
attend
a
physical
classroom
with
so
many
advantages
distance
learning
offers
an
ideal
educational
solution
for
students
who
are
looking
for
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
classroom
environment
after
researching
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
extending
the
school
day
to
two
hours
for
a
four day
week
it
is
the
recommendation
of
this
report
that
the
school
should
extend
the
school
day
the
extended
school
day
would
provide
more
time
for
teachers
to
complete
their
syllabi
and
would
reduce
the
amount
of
student
stress
due
to
shortened
test intensive
days
additionally
students
who
are
working
would
not
have
to
miss
classes
and
would
benefit
from
better
time
management
skills
that
would
come
from
the
four day
school
week
however
the
extended
school
day
should
come
with
specific
guidelines
such
as
an
optional
lunch
period
and
alternate
modes
of
instruction
to
ensure
that
student
engagement
and
educational
goals
are
not
sacrificed
failure
is
a
valuable
learning
experience
and
an
essential
part
of
any
journey
to
success
without
failure
young
minds
are
unable
to
understand
resilience
and
perseverance
failure
is
the
stepping
stone
to
success
and
can
act
as
an
encouraging
motivator
when
objectively
analyzed
understood
this
famously
stating
what
is
without
he
realized
that
success
was
not
capable
without
having
endured
failure
this
phrase
resonates
with
many
often
providing
that
needed
hope
for
those
wishing
to
reach
their
goals
it
is
only
when
we
walk
this
winding
path
of
successes
and
failures
that
we
can
gain
the
insight
needed
for
achieving
accomplishments
online
classes
from
home
provide
students
with
an
abundance
of
benefits
to
be
successful
in
taking
one
students
need
to
be
focused
and
have
high
concentration
levels
these
classes
offer
students
a
chance
to
develop
new
skills
and
knowledge
quickly
and
efficiently
an
added
perk
of
taking
classes
online
is
that
students
may
also
have
the
opportunity
to
have
free
time
for
other
activities
additionally
taking
tests
remotely
can
help
students
save
time
and
energy
by
not
having
to
travel
to
and
from
testing
locations
all
these
factors
make
taking
an
online
class
from
home
an
appealing
option
making
decisions
can
be
challenging
and
many
of
us
struggle
to
decide
the
right
path
to
take
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
no
matter
how
certain
you
might
be
that
your
opinion
is
right
one
person
s
opinion
is
rarely
enough
to
reach
a
successful
resolution
taking
the
input
of
more
than
one
person
and
considering
multiple
angles
is
an
essential
part
of
the
decision making
process
this
was
something
i
realized
during
my
sophomore
year
in
college
when
my
professor
assigned
us
a
group
project
with
each
member
in
the
group
bringing
a
unique
perspective
and
expertise
we
were
able
to
come
up
with
a
unique
and
creative
solution
to
the
project
that
none
of
us
would
have
thought
of
alone
without
having
all
of
us
involved
and
working
together
the
project
would
have
been
much
less
successful
in
addition
it
is
just
as
important
to
take
risks
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
does
not
allow
you
to
reach
new
heights
and
experience
different
things
after
graduating
college
i
decided
to
take
a
risk
and
move
to
a
new
city
despite
having
no
job
prospects
there
although
it
was
a
bit
of
a
roller
coaster
i
quickly
learned
about
the
city
and
grew
an
appreciation
for
it
while
meeting
amazing
people
and
making
lifelong
connections
it
is
these
risks
that
are
often
the
biggest
rewards
taking
multiple
opinions
into
account
and
having
the
courage
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
will
help
you
become
more
confident
in
your
decisions
and
achieve
things
you
never
thought
were
possible
setting
a
good
example
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
inspire
and
positively
influence
those
around
us
it
can
be
as
simple
as
exhibiting
positive
behaviors
such
as
being
kind
to
others
showing
understanding
and
exuding
a
sense
of
warmth
these
traits
can
inspire
others
to
believe
respect
and
trust
us
as
a
result
our
good
examples
can
create
opportunities
for
us
provide
stability
in
our
surroundings
and
help
us
create
a
powerful
legacy
that
can
last
for
generations
one
example
of
how
setting
a
good
example
can
lead
to
positive
outcomes
is
the
story
of
though
she
was
born
in
a
part
of
the
world
known
for
its
patriarchal
values
she
persevered
and
fought
for
equal
opportunities
for
girls
education
she
spoke
out
against
the
injustice
sparking
a
movement
and
becoming
a
symbol
of
strength
and
courage
for
millions
of
young
girls
around
the
world
the
late
also
serves
as
an
inspiring
example
of
setting
a
good
example
throughout
his
long fought
battle
against
racism
and
racial
injustice
he
remained
hopeful
and
peaceful
never
resorting
to
violence
in
spite
of
the
violence
meted
out
against
him
and
his
supporters
he
demonstrated
to
the
world
that
by
remaining
steadfast
in
his
beliefs
and
displaying
unwavering
courage
in
the
face
of
oppression
he
created
a
legacy
of
peace
and
justice
in
conclusion
setting
a
good
example
is
essential
for
achieving
positive
outcomes
both
for
ourselves
and
those
around
us
establishing
good
behaviors
such
as
kindness
understanding
and
courage
can
help
us
create
the
legacy
of
a
lifetime
and
inspire
generations
motivating
a
student
without
the
use
of
praise
can
be
a
difficult
but
important
task
for
educators
and
parents
has
shown
that
giving
praise
to
students
has
a
positive
effect
on
their
self esteem
providing
them
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
gratification
but
on
the
flip
side
there
is
also
evidence
that
suggests
an
excessive
amount
of
praise
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
giving
praise
too
often
can
lead
students
to
become
dependent
on
external
validation
making
them
less
likely
to
take
initiative
and
self motivate
if
it
does
n t
come
with
the
promise
of
a
reward
for
this
reason
it
is
important
to
recognize
when
praising
actually
helps
and
when
it
can
be
harmful
encouraging
students
to
strive
for
personal
goals
and
achievements
can
encourage
them
to
become
independent
and
self motivated
while
praise
may
be
beneficial
in
small
doses
celebrating
successes
holistically
and
emphasizing
the
journey
rather
than
the
result
can
be
just
as
if
not
more
rewarding
for
a
student
and
is
less
likely
to
have
a
negative
effect
it
is
widely
accepted
that
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
individuals
to
achieve
success
it
enables
us
overcome
any
obstacles
that
may
stand
in
our
path
and
push
us
to
our
full
potential
however
success
is
not
exclusively
dependent
on
having
a
positive
attitude
even
with
a
positive
outlook
success
is
not
always
guaranteed
it
is
important
to
allow
ourselves
to
feel
negative
emotions
and
understand
that
the
fullest
potential
of
success
can
not
be
reached
without
recognizing
our
insecurities
doubts
and
fears
one
beneficial
strategy
to
maintain
positivity
when
surrounded
by
negativity
is
to
take
a
break
and
focus
on
something
else
that
brings
us
pleasure
finding
simple
activities
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
our
own
time
can
help
to
temporarily
take
our
minds
away
from
our
worries
and
stressors
furthermore
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
discover
our
passions
and
achieve
our
personal
objectives
as
we
recognize
the
opportunities
and
meaningful
objectives
that
each
day
has
to
offer
finally
being
surrounded
with
positive
influences
and
supportive
friends
and
family
can
help
to
reinforce
our
positive
outlook
and
provide
us
with
the
optimism
and
belief
of
achieving
success
when
making
important
decisions
it
is
often
essential
to
seek
out
the
advice
of
the
people
who
are
closest
to
us
these
can
range
from
friends
and
family
to
mentors
and
consultants
experience
can
be
a
great
source
of
wisdom
for
important
decisions
as
it
can
provide
insightful
observations
and
a
unique
perspective
that
can
help
someone
to
see
a
problem
from
a
different
angle
i
personally
experienced
this
when
i
was
considering
joining
the
military
after
graduating
high
school
although
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
to
do
so
i
still
sought
out
the
advice
of
my
father
who
had
also
served
his
advice
was
simple
but
powerful to
make
sure
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
think
through
every
angle
before
making
a
final
decision
he
knew
the
value
of
carefully
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
any
decision
even
one
as
significant
as
mine
in
addition
to
family
friends
are
also
an
invaluable
source
of
advice
when
making
decisions
we
often
build
our
closest
circles
of
friends
over
many
years
and
they
get
to
know
us
as
well
as
we
know
ourselves
good
friends
can
often
be
additional
eyes
and
ears
on
a
situation
and
can
even
offer
fresh
perspectives
that
would
not
have
otherwise
occurred
to
us
therefore
it
is
clear
that
both
life
experience
and
guidance
from
friends
and
family
are
essential
when
making
important
decisions
seeking
input
from
trusted
advisors
can
help
to
confirm
or
adjust
the
direction
of
a
decision
leading
to
a
more
informed
choice
ultimately
the
combination
of
life
experience
and
wisdom
from
trusted
sources
can
be
invaluable
when
making
decisions
online
classes
can
be
a
useful
way
for
students
to
receive
an
education
but
they
also
come
with
risks
that
can
not
be
ignored
some
schools
in
the
states
should
not
offer
online
classes
for
their
students
because
they
could
easily
become
a
substitute
for
vital
social
interaction
and
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
the
overall
quality
of
learning
for
many
students
online
classes
remove
the
compelling
motivation
of
being
in
contact
with
their
teachers
and
peers
without
this
real
connection
with
people
it
can
become
extremely
easy
for
students
to
neglect
their
work
skip
assignments
and
procrastinate
more
than
if
they
were
physically
in
the
classroom
without
this
condition
of
accountability
students
are
more
likely
to
receive
a
sub par
education
furthermore
it
is
impossible
to
replicate
the
real world
experience
from
a
computer
by
exclusively
taking
online
classes
students
miss
out
on
learning
skills
such
as
public
speaking
participating
in
group
activities
and
working
collectively
with
peers
interaction
is
a
crucial
part
of
learning
as
well
as
a
student
s
development
if
students
are
used
to
exclusively
taking
classes
online
it
poses
the
risk
of
further
isolating
them
from
the
world
in
conclusion
the
potential
risks
that
come
with
online
classes
are
not
worth
the
convenience
in
the
states
should
not
offer
online
classes
if
it
means
compromising
the
quality
of
education
and
decreasing
social
interaction
for
their
students
self reliance
is
an
essential
human
characteristic
that
is
both
necessary
and
beneficial
it
is
the
ability
to
make
decisions
and
cope
with
the
consequences
both
good
and
bad
in
order
to
achieve
a
certain
goal
it
cultivates
a
sense
of
independence
and
autonomy
that
is
necessary
for
growth
and
personal
development
in
real
life
self reliance
can
be
seen
as
a
problem solving
tool
when
faced
with
various
obstacles
for
example
a
student
who
is
struggling
to
write
a
difficult
essay
may
need
to
rely
on
themselves
in
order
to
overcome
the
challenge
seeking
help
and
guidance
from
others
can
be
helpful
but
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
student
to
make
the
final
decisions
and
take
the
necessary
steps
to
reach
success
the
same
applies
to
nature
where
animals
and
plants
must
use
self reliance
to
survive
in
their
ever changing
environment
they
must
navigate
their
surroundings
make
decisions
and
weather
the
consequences
in
order
to
secure
resources
and
thrive
the
thought
process
behind
self reliance
is
personal
and
divergent
it
requires
the
individual
to
assess
the
situation
consider
potential
options
and
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
decision
before
making
a
final
choice
the
decisions
we
make
can
have
a
considerable
impact
on
the
outcome
so
it
is
important
to
consider
all
the
consequences
and
think
logically
before
we
act
in
conclusion
self reliance
is
an
incredibly
valuable
trait
that
is
both
necessary
and
beneficial
it
is
impossible
to
progress
without
the
ability
to
make
informed
decisions
and
face
the
consequences
alone
ultimately
self reliance
is
the
key
to
personal
growth
and
success
education
is
a
fundamental
part
of
life
it
can
be
a
chore
or
a
pleasant
experience
depending
on
how
activities
are
implemented
when
done
right
activities
can
be
enjoyable
and
educational
simultaneously
this
essay
will
explore
the
concept
of
education
activities
that
are
both
enjoyable
and
educational
by
looking
at
examples
from
science
experiments
sports
activities
and
playing
instruments
science
experiments
are
an
often
overlooked
source
of
educational
activities
that
can
be
enjoyable
for
younger
students
easy
experiments
such
as
growing
plants
producing
audio
waves
or
exploring
the
natural
world
with
a
microscope
can
provide
hours
of
enjoyable
education
not
only
does
this
give
children
an
opportunity
to
use
their
bodies
minds
and
senses
but
it
also
helps
engage
their
curiosity
problem solving
skills
and
ability
to
think
critically
sports
activities
are
also
an
excellent
way
to
make
learning
enjoyable
team
sports
races
and
competitions
can
bring
out
the
best
of
children
who
are
looking
for
a
chance
to
learn
and
grow
at
the
same
time
it
can
be
as
simple
as
playing
a
game
of
tag
where
the
children
have
to
use
their
knowledge
of
math
and
geometry
or
using
a
basketball
court
to
illustrate
the
basics
of
angles
and
trajectories
this
can
be
an
incredibly
effective
way
to
make
learning
fun
and
memorable
finally
playing
musical
instruments
can
be
both
enjoyable
and
educational
this
can
include
learning
to
play
a
guitar
singing
along
with
a
choir
or
mastering
the
drums
these
activities
require
the
use
of
key
listening
coordination
and
analytical
skills
while
also
allowing
the
student
to
explore
music
theory
composition
and
history
this
type
of
activity
can
also
foster
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
pride
in
the
student
making
it
an
enjoyable
educational
experience
in
conclusion
educational
activities
can
be
both
enjoyable
and
educational
when
done
right
through
using
examples
from
science
experiments
sports
activities
and
playing
instruments
we
have
seen
how
educational
activities
can
engage
children
on
multiple
levels
while
also
providing
an
avenue
for
personal
growth
and
satisfaction
as
such
educational
activities
should
be
seen
as
an
ideal
way
to
foster
long
lasting
learning
that
can
be
both
enjoyable
and
educational
once
said
you
must
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
in
order
to
grow
this
is
a
powerful
idea
that
encourages
us
to
challenge
ourselves
and
venture
into
new
areas
of
knowledge
and
understanding
when
we
go
beyond
our
comfort
zone
we
open
our
minds
and
broaden
our
perspectives
allowing
us
to
see
things
from
new
and
interesting
angles
additionally
pushing
ourselves
into
unfamiliar
territory
can
help
us
realize
our
own
potential
for
instance
a
few
months
ago
i
decided
to
rely
on
myself
for
a
project
that
i
was
tackling
i
chose
to
learn
a
new
programming
language
that
i
had
never
used
before
and
the
sense
of
accomplishment
i
felt
when
i
completed
it
was
immense
not
only
had
i
acquired
a
new
skill
i
had
also
developed
the
confidence
to
keep
pushing
myself
and
discovering
difficult
concepts
all
in
all
going
beyond
one
s
current
knowledge
helps
develop
valuable
skills
as
well
as
a
sense
of
self satisfaction
being
active
and
having
an
active
lifestyle
can
have
many
benefits
and
drawbacks
one
benefit
of
staying
active
is
that
it
can
help
improve
one
s
overall
physical
health
as
it
can
aid
in
decreasing
a
variety
of
disease
risks
such
as
obesity
diabetes
and
heart
disease
staying
active
can
also
help
one
s
mental
health
as
studies
have
shown
that
regular
physical
activity
can
help
reduce
levels
of
stress
and
depression
additionally
staying
active
can
help
maintain
a
healthy
weight
and
can
even
help
one
to
look
and
feel
better
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
living
an
active
lifestyle
and
participating
in
physical
activities
can
place
physical
strain
and
stress
on
the
body
which
can
lead
to
aches
pains
and
injuries
if
one
is
not
careful
additionally
not
all
forms
of
exercise
are
equal
and
certain
activities
can
involve
more
risk
than
others
furthermore
staying
active
requires
motivation
and
dedication
which
can
be
tough
for
some
people
to
find
in
conclusion
while
there
are
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
living
an
active
lifestyle
the
benefits
far
outweigh
the
drawbacks
engaging
in
regular
physical
activity
and
staying
active
can
help
one
achieve
overall
physical
and
mental
wellbeing
and
can
also
help
reduce
the
risks
of
many
serious
diseases
the
quote
by
that
failure
you
wo
n t
succeed
in
life
is
an
accurate
statement
for
the
most
part
many
successful
people
have
succeeded
by
taking
risks
and
learning
from
their
failures
for
example
some
entrepreneurs
have
built
a
successful
business
by
leveraging
their
past
failures
to
refine
their
product
and
operation
strategies
on
the
other
hand
some
individuals
have
achieved
success
without
any
failures
such
as
award winning
actors
and
authors
it
can
be
argued
that
failure
is
not
always
necessary
for
success
and
that
a
person
can
reach
their
goals
with
the
right
attitude
perseverance
and
hard
work
in
my
opinion
failure
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
and
one
of
the
key
strategies
for
achieving
success
is
to
learn
from
mistakes
and
continue
striving
towards
one
s
goals
cellphones
in
the
classroom
can
have
a
marked
effect
on
student
success
both
positive
and
negative
although
having
a
tool
for
information
available
can
be
beneficial
it
can
also
be
a
distraction
from
the
important
task
at
hand learning
and
engaging
in
academic
pursuits
three
key
effects
of
having
a
cellphone
in
the
classroom
are
decreased
attention
to
the
teacher
inappropriate
usage
for
non educational
purposes
and
disruption
of
the
classroom
environment
not
listening
to
the
teacher
eliminates
the
opportunity
to
learn
and
participate
in
a
meaningful
way
leading
to
decreased
academic
success
additionally
if
students
are
using
their
phone
for
non educational
purposes
such
as
playing
games
or
sending
messages
this
takes
away
from
focus
on
educational
tasks
finally
when
the
classroom
environment
is
consistently
disrupted
by
the
noise
and
visual
distraction
that
accompanying
cellphone
use
the
learning
experience
is
compromised
although
there
are
potential
benefits
of
having
a
cellphone
in
the
classroom
people
should
not
use
cellphones
for
non educational
purposes
phones
should
be
used
for
academic
pursuits
with
caution
in
order
to
maximize
the
positive
impact
to
academic
success
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
can
be
beneficial
in
a
myriad
of
ways
one
of
the
primary
benefits
is
an
individual
s
mental
well being
those
who
approach
life
with
a
positive
frame
of
mind
are
more
likely
to
remain
calmer
and
better
equipped
to
handle
stress
additionally
a
person
with
a
positive
attitude
is
a
lot
more
appealing
to
others
increasing
the
likelihood
they
will
build
strong
relationships
with
the
people
around
them
on
the
contrary
there
are
those
who
believe
a
positive
attitude
is
not
required
in
order
to
succeed
however
studies
have
demonstrated
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
decisions
an
individual
makes
throughout
their
life
people
who
cultivate
a
positive
outlook
on
life
are
more
likely
to
pursue
educational
and
career
opportunities
helping
them
to
reach
a
greater
level
of
success
moreover
finding
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
every
situation
can
create
a
lasting
advantage
in
areas
such
as
problem solving
and
creativity
to
conclude
having
a
positive
attitude
in
everyday
life
can
have
immense
positive
consequences
not
only
does
it
help
maintain
an
individual
s
mental
health
but
it
also
increases
the
likelihood
of
making
better
decisions
that
may
lead
to
higher
levels
of
success
taking
the
time
to
cultivate
a
positive
viewpoint
can
create
innumerable
long term
benefits
that
are
well
worth
the
effort
i
make
sure
to
provide
my
dog
with
a
healthy
nutritious
meal
every
day
during
the
summer
months
i
make
sure
to
keep
a
bowl
of
fresh
cool
water
in
the
yard
and
in
the
winter
i
make
sure
to
provide
my
dog
with
a
bowl
of
regular
water
whenever
i
can
i
take
my
dog
out
for
a
long
walk
and
allow
them
to
go
outside
whenever
they
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
i
also
make
sure
to
spend
time
with
my
dog
allowing
them
to
feel
my
love
and
affection
i
provide
them
with
a
variety
of
toys
and
let
them
interact
with
our
family
and
friends
lastly
i
find
a
comfortable
spot
where
my
dog
is
able
to
rest
and
relax
after
a
long
day
long
summer
breaks
for
students
have
several
potential
benefits
for
their
educational
development
for
one
students
can
have
the
opportunity
to
stay
engaged
in
educational
activities
such
as
reading
or
attending
summer
school
which
can
help
maximize
learning
outcomes
and
boost
academic
success
even
more
longer
summer
breaks
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
explore
and
participate
in
extra curricular
endeavors
such
as
internships
or
job
shadowing
opportunities
which
can
help
them
find
a
career
path
they
are
interested
in
or
gain
valuable
job
skills
on
the
other
hand
short
summer
breaks
can
also
provide
benefits
for
students
educational
development
for
example
classroom
environments
are
structured
to
provide
students
with
a
consistent
and
secure
learning
atmosphere
something
which
they
may
not
have
access
to
over
a
long
summer
break
short
summer
breaks
reduce
the
amount
of
disruptive
absences
this
allows
students
to
maintain
the
same
peer
group
over
the
course
of
the
academic
year
providing
them
with
a
sense
of
accessibility
as
well
as
the
ability
to
form
relationships
with
their
peers
teachers
and
school
faculty
overall
both
short
and
long
summer
breaks
provide
students
with
potential
educational
benefits
and
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
students
and
their
families
to
decide
what
works
best
for
them
working
in
a
group
is
beneficial
for
students
and
life
outside
of
school
work
helps
foster
a
sense
of
collaboration
communication
critical
thinking
and
problem solving
skills
these
skills
are
invaluable
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
and
can
help
prepare
students
for
entering
the
workforce
for
example
working
in
a
group
can
teach
students
the
importance
of
compromise
negotiation
and
organization
when
tackling
a
problem
they
can
learn
valuable
leadership
skills
as
well
as
the
importance
of
listening
and
understanding
others
points
of
view
working
in
a
group
also
encourages
students
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
their
peers
which
can
help
ease
the
transition
from
school
to
a
professional
environment
where
team
collaboration
is
vital
overall
group
work
is
beneficial
for
students
in
several
aspects
by
participating
in
group
work
students
gain
the
important
skills
needed
to
succeed
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
of
paramount
importance
for
success
a
positive
attitude
helps
to
increase
motivation
enables
better
communication
with
others
and
increases
productivity
those
who
have
a
positive
attitude
approach
tasks
relationships
and
challenges
head on
with
the
knowledge
and
confidence
that
they
can
succeed
by
having
a
positive
attitude
people
can
be
better
prepared
for
any
situation
and
have
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
to
stay
the
course
negative
thinking
can
be
a
huge
roadblock
to
progress
and
success
people
who
lack
a
positive
attitude
often
become
overwhelmed
by
obstacles
spend
too
much
time
worrying
and
don
t
take
risks
with
a
negative
attitude
people
are
more
likely
to
make
mistakes
procrastinate
and
miss
out
on
opportunities
that
could
lead
to
success
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
giving
effort
towards
achieving
a
goal
leads
to
greater
success
than
giving
only
someone
with
a
positive
attitude
has
best
chance
of
succeeding
because
they
believe
in
their
own
abilities
and
the
value
of
their
contributions
moreover
having
a
positive
attitude
in
the
face
of
adversity
helps
to
keep
morale
high
and
enhances
resilience
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
present
practice
gratitude
and
surround
oneself
with
encouraging
people
one
of
the
most
influential
quotes
of
all
time
said
never
to
be
idle
to
this
day
it
remains
a
timeless
piece
of
advice
for
those
looking
to
make
the
most
of
their
life
by
being
active
and
responsible
people
can
make
progress
towards
the
goals
they
set
out
to
accomplish
allocating
time
wisely
and
making
responsible
decisions
can
open
up
doors
to
opportunities
that
may
have
otherwise
been
missed
if
one
chooses
to
be
idle
the
effects
can
be
detrimental
wasted
and
goals
not
achieved
can
lead
one
to
feel
unmotivated
and
incomplete
although
it
is
tempting
to
think
that
sometimes
it
is
better
to
do
nothing
doing
nothing
rarely
brings
substantial
benefits
it
is
more
rewarding
and
beneficial
in
the
long
run
to
be
proactive
and
take
initiative
towards
what
you
truly
desire
by
stepping
out
of
one
s
comfort
zone
new
paths
open
allowing
one
to
become
the
best
version
of
themselves
therefore
i
agree
with
s
sentiment
and
believe
that
it
is
crucial
to
be
determined
and
never
idle
it
is
often
argued
that
schools
should
make
students
join
extra curricular
activities
but
this
can
have
a
damaging
effect
on
students
making
students
join
extracurricular
activities
increases
homework
burdens
and
leads
to
a
heightened
level
of
fatigue
and
stress
when
students
are
asked
to
join
a
club
or
participate
in
certain
activities
it
can
impede
their
ability
to
focus
on
their
schoolwork
this
in
turn
can
lead
to
increased
amounts
of
homework
and
less
time
to
do
it
in
this
ultimately
leaves
them
with
less
time
to
spend
on
their
academic
courses
and
can
lead
to
substandard
work
in
addition
to
the
increased
homework
students
may
also
experience
increased
levels
of
fatigue
and
stress
trying
to
balance
an
extra curricular
activity
with
their
usual
course
of
study
can
be
taxing
and
puts
students
under
tremendous
stress
this
can
lead
to
poorer
academic
results
as
well
as
mental
and
physical
health
issues
with
all
these
factors
in
mind
principals
should
not
make
students
join
extra curricular
activities
the
increased
strain
on
a
student
s
academic
schedule
and
the
strain
of
anxiety
and
fatigue
can
negatively
affect
a
student
s
education
it
is
up
to
the
students
to
decide
if
they
would
like
to
join
an
extra curricular
activity
not
the
school
visiting
the
and
would
be
a
dream
come
true
for
me
as
someone
who
has
always
had
a
passion
for
acting
there
is
something
about
the
stage
that
has
always
captured
my
imagination
being
at
the
and
would
provide
me
with
an
opportunity
to
see
firsthand
the
beauty
of
live
theater
although
i
have
seen
some
incredible
performances
in
the
movies
and
on
television
there
is
nothing
like
experiencing
a
live
performance
in
person
the
and
provides
a
unique
experience
with
its
combination
of
lectures
workshops
and
performances
i
could
take
part
in
a
variety
of
classes
such
as
acting
playwriting
set
design
and
even
costume
design
this
would
allow
me
to
gain
an
insider
s
perspective
on
the
world
of
theater
and
discover
what
opportunities
i
may
have
as
an
actress
i
could
also
take
part
in
a
variety
of
workshop
and
master
classes
taught
by
well known
performers
and
directors
this
would
give
me
invaluable
insight
into
the
industry
and
help
me
to
understand
how
i
could
make
my
career
as
an
actress
more
successful
the
live
performances
at
the
and
would
be
even
more
rewarding
as
i
would
be
able
to
witness
the
effects
of
hard
work
and
talent
first hand
from
the
actors
to
the
directors
to
the
set
designers
i
would
be
able
to
gain
insight
into
the
rigorous
process
involved
in
putting
on
a
show
seeing
all
of
the
behind the scenes
work
that
goes
into
a
performance
would
give
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
craft
of
acting
and
inspire
me
to
pursue

offers
an
experience
that
would
be
invaluable
to
me
as
an
aspiring
actress
from
getting
to
take
part
in

classes
and
workshops
to
experiencing
the
joy
of

students
should
not
be
forced
to
consume
healthy
food
in
the
school
lunch
system
the
need
to
consume
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
or
balanced
and
nutritious
meals
can
not
be
overemphasized
however
it
should
not
be
mandated
in
the
school
lunch
system
since
it
takes
away
the
students
right
to
choose
their
own
food
when
students
are
forced
to
eat
healthy
food
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
meals
are
as
nutritious
and
beneficial
to
their
health
as
parents
or
authorities
tend
to
believe
may
not
like
the
mandated
food
which
may
result
in
them
feeling
deprived
healthy
food
tend
to
have
less
flavour
and
appeal
than
the
junk
food
that
students
usually
prefer
consumption
of
healthy
options
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
a
student
s
enjoyment
of
food
and
there
is
a
risk
of
discouragement
of
a
genuine
interest
to
try
and
explore
healthy
foods
furthermore
healthy
food
is
often
more
expensive
than
junk
food
the
government
should
take
this
into
account
and
not
enact
policies
that
are
likely
to
cause
financial
problems
for
families
that
may
not
be
able
to
afford
the
more
expensive
more
nutritious
food
in
conclusion
mandating
a
healthy
lunch
system
in
schools
is
not
a
good
idea
students
should
be
encouraged
and
informed
on
the
benefits
of
healthy
eating
but
ultimately
be
left
to
make
their
own
choices
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
incredibly
significant
to
personal
success
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
individuals
to
take
on
obstacles
with
enthusiasm
and
resilience
in
the
workplace
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
to
motivate
innovate
problem solve
and
lift
the
spirits
of
colleagues
a
positive
attitude
is
also
especially
beneficial
during
times
of
need
when
one
must
face
personal
life
crises
with
courage
a
negative
attitude
can
prevent
one
from
prospering
as
it
can
give
rise
to
feelings
of
doubt
insecurity
and
helplessness
remaining
optimistic
and
maintaining
a
positive
outlook
in
times
of
need
is
essential
for
one
s
emotional
well being
and
capacity
to
persevere
ultimately
having
a
positive
attitude
leads
to
personal
success
self confidence
and
a
willingness
to
take
risks
making
it
an
invaluable
asset
for
anyone
seeking
growth
and
progress
in
life
graduating
high
school
in
four
or
three
years
has
potential
advantages
and
drawbacks
that
must
be
considered
when
making
the
decision
to
pursue
the
shortened
schedule
summer
classes
are
an
option
for
those
looking
to
graduate
early
but
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
reasons
one
might
not
want
to
take
courses
during
the
summer
such
as
exhaustion
from
taking
classes
during
the
school
year
or
wanting
to
pursue
other
interests
such
as
a
job
or
a
summer
internship
elective
classes
are
a
great
way
to
round
out
a
high
school
educational
experience
electives
may
include
art
music
foreign
language
and
other
courses
not
typically
part
of
the
traditional
curriculum
these
classes
may
have
an
advantage
in
terms
of
helping
a
student
stand
out
in
the
college
application
process
additional
factors
influencing
student
decisions
include
working
to
save
money
for
college
and
the
cost
of
supplies
such
as
textbooks
graduating
high
school
early
could
ease
the
financial
burden
but
the
amount
of
coursework
students
may
miss
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
their
college
readiness
ultimately
students
must
consider
potential
financial
time
and
educational
implications
when
determining
how
valuable
an
early
graduation
timeline
will
be
for
their
academic
future
collaboration
can
offer
a
number
of
benefits
both
academically
and
socially
in
terms
of
academics
working
in
groups
promotes
the
sharing
of
ideas
and
resources
which
can
improve
the
quality
of
the
work
being
done
and
reduce
the
overall
burden
of
tasks
for
example
a
group
of
students
working
on
a
school
project
can
divide
the
work
into
manageable
amounts
with
each
member
of
the
group
having
their
own
task
and
accountability
for
its
completion
by
doing
this
the
overall
project
can
be
completed
much
more
efficiently
than
if
each
student
was
working
on
their
own
socially
working
in
groups
can
allow
for
the
development
of
relationships
and
networking
opportunities
students
can
form
relationships
with
their
peers
and
learn
how
to
work
effectively
as
a
team
these
skills
can
prove
to
be
invaluable
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
as
they
can
improve
interactions
communication
and
teamwork
abilities
in
other
aspects
of
life
though
working
in
groups
can
offer
these
benefits
it
can
also
pose
potential
challenges
not
every
group
member
is
capable
of
putting
in
an
equal
amount
of
effort
and
a
lack
of
respect
for
one
another
s
contributions
can
lead
to
inefficiencies
or
delays
in
completing
the
projects
to
overcome
this
group
members
should
be
mindful
of
giving
each
other
space
and
voice
and
be
open
to
productive
feedback
and
compromise
additionally
establishing
clear
expectations
goals
and
deadlines
for
the
project
and
assigning
clear
roles
to
each
group
member
can
help
ensure
that
everyone
is
on
the
same
page
and
that
all
tasks
are
completed
on
time
in
conclusion
working
in
groups
can
offer
both
academic
and
social
benefits
but
challenges
can
arise
if
adequate
measures
are
not
taken
to
ensure
everyone
is
working
together
efficiently
and
respectfully
by
fostering
communication
and
understanding
within
the
group
and
by
establishing
expectations
and
roles
the
members
of
a
group
can
work
together
effectively
to
complete
a
project
with
the
best
possible
results

one
of
the

despite
the
countless
obstacles
that
may

the
stories
of
these

individuals
serve
to
illustrate
the
truth
of

words
that
if
we
stay
resilient
in

after
high
school
i
was
determined
to
pursue
my
ambition
of
becoming
a
professional
dancer
but
i
quickly
realized
it
was
n t
going
to
be
easy
to
break
into
that
competitive
field
there
was
a
fierce
competition
and
not
everyone
had
the
talent
or
the
dedication
to
make
it
in
the
industry
so
for
me
it
was
a
clear
choice
hard
work
and
determination
was
the
only
way
forward
i
worked
tirelessly
with
a
single minded
focus
putting
in
hour
days
and
foregoing
most
luxuries
in
order
to
reach
my
goal
even
when
i
was
feeling
defeated
and
disheartened
i
would
look
to
the
inspiring
example
of
figures
such
as
and
knew
that
if
they
could
go
from
humble
beginnings
to
global
superstardom
through
hard
work
and
perseverance
then
so
could
i
although
luck
clearly
does
play
a
part
in
success
there
is
no
substitute
for
hard
work
through
hard
work
and
dedication
i
achieved
my
dream
of
becoming
a
professional
dancer
as
well
as
feeling
an
intense
sense
of
accomplishment
i
felt
a
deep
sense
of
pride
in
knowing
that
my
success
was
entirely
down
to
my
own
hard
work
and
determination
after
working
hard
for
the
past
three
years
i
had
high
hopes
for
achieving
the
coveted
supervisor
position
i
was
aiming
for
but
unfortunately
despite
all
my
efforts
i
still
fell
short
of
the
mark
for
a
moment
i
felt
a
twinge
of
disappointment
but
reflecting
on
my
experience
i
have
now
come
to
understand
the
importance
of
failure
in
the
pursuit
of
success
i
now
find
myself
at
a
crossroads
pondering
if
the
supervisor
position
is
still
the
best
choice
for
me
i
know
that
the
pay
is
higher
than
my
current
position
i
will
have
a
greater
degree
of
independence
and
i
would
be
working
in
a
busy
bustling
location
on
the
other
hand
i
am
aware
that
the
position
comes
with
additional
requirements
and
expectations
that
i
m
not
entirely
sure
i
m
ready
for
weighing
out
all
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
offer
it
s
clear
that
my
current
actions
will
determine
where
i
end
up
i
need
to
evaluate
what
i
can
do
differently
in
order
to
maximize
my
chances
of
surpassing
all
the
expectations
for
the
position
with
this
understanding
i
am
confident
that
i
will
eventually
get
to
the
place
i
want
to
be
and
achieve
my
goals
imagination
and
knowledge
are
both
essential
components
of
human
life
and
the
development
of
our
societies
imagination
is
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
conceive
or
create
images
and
ideas
that
are
not
based
on
past
experience
which
makes
it
a
fundamental
tool
for
exploration
innovation
and
creativity
on
the
other
hand
is
the
accumulation
of
facts
information
and
skills
acquired
through
study
experience
or
teaching
allowing
us
to
use
this
knowledge
in
a
practical
and
meaningful
way
when
we
put
these
two
concepts
together
they
become
even
more
powerful
imagination
can
open
up
the
door
for
knowledge
to
be
used
in
creative
ways
allowing
us
to
develop
new
theories
solve
problems
explore
new
possibilities
and
come
up
with
innovative
solutions
it
is
this
combination
of
imagination
and
knowledge
that
is
essential
to
learning
and
development
without
imagination
knowledge
would
become
dull
and
uninspiring
as
it
would
lack
the
freedom
of
thought
needed
to
truly
propel
us
forward
imagination
allows
us
to
think
outside
the
box
to
explore
ideas
that
would
otherwise
be
overlooked
and
to
find
solutions
to
complex
situations
at
the
same
time
knowledge
allows
us
to
take
our
ideas
and
put
them
into
practice
in
a
tangible
form
therefore
the
importance
of
imagination
compared
to
knowledge
can
not
be
underestimated
they
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
one
without
the
other
would
not
be
enough
together
they
offer
the
perfect
balance
between
theoretical
thinking
and
practical
application
allowing
for
a
greater
level
of
understanding
and
progress
when
i
was
in
middle
school
i
started
to
research
career
options
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
was
to
talk
to
my
teachers
i
also
went
on
college
and
company
visits
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
what
i
might
want
to
do
in
the
future
i
looked
into
what
classes
i
could
take
in
high
school
to
give
me
an
advantage
in
the
career
i
would
choose
then
i
focused
on
what
college
requirements
would
need
to
be
met
for
my
desired
field
of
work
i
also
started
to
see
the
benefit
of
having
ambition
and
working
hard
from
a
young
age
to
put
me
on
the
fast track
for
success
in
the
profession
i
chose
taking
advice
from
others
can
play
a
pivotal
role
in
shaping
life
decisions
for
one
looking
to
mentors
parents
or
guardians
for
advice
can
be
immensely
beneficial
they
have
a
wealth
of
knowledge
life
experience
and
wisdom
that
can
take
us
far
just
look
at
and
the
incredible
difference
he
made
by
ending
slavery
after
he
d
requested
counsel
from
various
members
of
his
cabinet
in
the
same
way
advice
can
change
the
course
of
our
lives
much
like
how
trying
new
foods
from
different
chefs
can
open
our
eyes
and
palates
to
new
culinary
delights
it
is
not
just
the
potential
benefits
of
advice
for
life
decisions
however
by
taking
the
advice
and
wisdom
of
others
and
applying
it
to
our
day to day
lives
we
can
gain
a
more
successful
and
hardworking
mindset
a
mentor
may
inspire
us
to
strive
for
excellence
a
parent
may
teach
us
the
importance
of
striving
for
balance
or
a
friend
may
encourage
us
to
broaden
our
perspectives
and
explore
new
opportunities
in
short
advice
is
invaluable
when
it
comes
to
making
more
successful
and
informed
decisions
throughout
our
lives
the
key
to
achieving
our
goals
is
to
develop
patience
as
the
old
saying
goes
haste
makes
waste
if
we
act
too
quickly
or
without
proper
consideration
we
are
likely
to
make
mistakes
and
take
the
wrong
course
of
action
which
can
be
detrimental
in
the
long
run
to
prevent
this
we
should
act
thoughtfully
and
patiently
to
ensure
our
best
efforts
are
taken
towards
reaching
our
goals
for
example
let
s
consider
planning
for
a
successful
business
venture
if
we
rush
through
the
process
of
researching
potential
investments
or
launching
a
product
we
may
make
mistakes
that
will
cost
us
money
in
the
future
even
something
like
setting
up
a
website
can
require
patience
we
may
need
to
take
the
time
to
ensure
our
web
hosting
and
security
are
up
to
scratch
in
order
to
guarantee
the
safety
and
satisfaction
of
our
customers
and
accuracy
are
essential
to
achieving
our
goals
when
we
take
the
time
to
ensure
everything
is
completed
correctly
and
to
the
best
of
our
abilities
it
is
much
more
likely
that
we
will
succeed
in
the
long
run
therefore
developing
patience
and
mastering
the
skill
of
working
smarter
not
harder
is
a
crucial
part
of
setting
and
obtaining
our
goals
some
people
argue
that
it
is
solely
up
to
an
individual
to
choose
their
own
character
traits
they
believe
that
we
have
the
ability
to
choose
traits
such
as
kindness
rudeness
helpfulness
etc
however
i
believe
that
our
character
is
formed
by
influences
beyond
our
control
for
example
we
often
see
people
around
us
display
certain
qualities
and
behaviors
we
may
be
exposed
to
these
characters
day
after
day
and
with
enough
of
this
exposure
our
own
mindset
and
attitude
can
begin
to
shift
and
adapt
additionally
there
are
certain
lifestyle
habits
and
environmental
circumstances
that
can
have
a
large
influence
on
who
we
become
education
familial
relationships
economic
status
etc
all
play
a
role
in
our
overall
character
similarly
genetics
are
also
a
huge
factor
in
our
overall
character
development
our
values
thought
processes
and
communication
patterns
can
all
be
linked
to
our
genetic
makeup
this
can
be
seen
in
the
many
cases
of
people
who
grew
up
in
very
different
environments
and
yet
have
similar
behavioral
traits
and
characteristics
in
conclusion
while
we
may
be
able
to
choose
certain
character
traits
it
is
important
to
remember
that
our
character
is
much
more
complex
than
that
many
outside
influences
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
our
character
embracing
this
understanding
of
character
development
can
help
us
appreciate
the
complexities
of
our
personality
and
the
various
factors
that
come
together
to
shape
who
we
are
the
american
government
can
take
a
number
of
actions
to
reduce
poverty
and
inequality
among
citizens
there
are
several
approaches
that
can
provide
direct
services
to
citizens
such
as
providing
food
assistance
providing
job
training
and
support
and
advancing
policies
to
increase
income
and
wages
these
direct
services
could
help
provide
immediate
aid
to
those
facing
poverty
and
potentially
lead
to
long term
positive
outcomes
for
citizens
if
they
are
able
to
access
these
services
and
gain
the
skills
they
need
for
a
better
future
however
there
are
also
policy based
solutions
that
can
be
used
to
achieve
long term
improvements
in
poverty
and
economic
inequality
these
could
include
raising
taxes
on
wealthy
individuals
and
corporations
providing
tax
credits
and
incentives
to
poorer
americans
and
implementing
programs
to
invest
in
education
infrastructure
and
jobs
these
solutions
could
have
a
long term
positive
impact
on
low income
americans
by
providing
them
with
access
to
better
education
economic
opportunities
and
job
stability
overall
the
american
government
has
a
number
of
strategies
at
its
disposal
to
reduce
poverty
and
inequality
among
americans
and
the
potential
impact
of
these
solutions
on
the
population
should
be
thoroughly
investigated
failure
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
that
most
experience
in
some
way
but
does
failure
need
to
be
present
in
order
for
all
of
us
to
enjoy
success
some
people
might
argue
that
it
does
but
i
disagree
i
believe
that
failure
is
not
necessary
to
have
success
and
that
it
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
enthusiasm
of
us
perceive
failure
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
journey
of
life
towards
success
failure
teaches
us
lessons
and
sometimes
strengthens
our
determination
however
for
many
of
us
failure
can
be
a
crushing
blow
that
completely
destroys
our
enthusiasm
depending
on
the
individual
failure
can
cause
us
to
give
up
and
become
discouraged
it
can
make
us
feel
unworthy
or
incapable
of
achieving
future
goals
which
can
harm
the
state
of
our
enthusiasm
with
this
in
mind
i
argue
that
failure
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
present
to
have
success
rather
it
can
stunt
our
enthusiasm
and
thus
prevent
us
from
achieving
success
to
illustrate
this
point
i
will
refer
to
my
own
personal
experiences
a
few
years
ago
after
failing
the
same
test
over
and
over
i
felt
completely
discouraged
and
ready
to
give
up
i
thought
that
because
i
failed
at
one
task
i
was
incapable
of
achieving
all
my
other
goals
this
brought
my
enthusiasm
to
a
complete
standstill
and
i
felt
ready
to
throw
in
the
towel
at
this
moment
i
realized
that
failure
doesn
t
have
to
be
present
in
order
to
succeed
instead
i
understood
that
my
attitude
towards
failure
was
what
had
to
change
by
being
more
aware
of
my
expectations
and
being
confident
in
myself
i
was
able
to
push
forward
and
find
success
despite
the
failures
i
had
faced
in
the
past
in
conclusion
failure
is
not
necessary
to
have
success
and
it
can
have
a
debilitating
effect
on
enthusiasm
despite
the
life
lessons
that
failure
can
teach
us
it
can
also
be
detrimental
to
our
well being
when
we
become
too
fixated
on
it
i
urge
us
all
to
remember
that
success
does
not
have
to
be
preceded
by
failure
and
to
be
more
confident
and
accepting
of
ourselves
after
setbacks
that
way
we
can
have
a
much
better
chance
of
achieving
success
the
debate
of
public
school
vs
distance
learning
has
been
a
long
standing
argument
on
one
hand
public
school
provides
students
the
opportunity
to
experience
social
interactions
and
peer
relationships
that
will
benefit
them
in
the
long
run
however
with
the
current
pandemic
distance
learning
has
become
a
necessity
for
those
considering
distance
learning
it
is
important
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
to
ensure
that
it
is
the
right
fit
for
their
situation
one
of
the
key
advantages
of
distance
learning
is
that
it
is
more
convenient
and
can
be
schedule
to
fit
a
variety
of
needs
students
can
also
access
materials
and
resources
online
that
would
otherwise
be
difficult
in
a
traditional
setting
furthermore
it
allows
students
to
customize
their
learning
by
working
independently
and
taking
charge
of
their
own
progress
however
it
is
important
to
note
that
distance
learning
also
has
its
drawbacks
the
lack
of
social
interaction
can
lead
to
feelings
of
isolation
while
also
making
it
easier
to
cheat
as
there
isn
t
the
same
level
of
accountability
as
there
would
be
in
a
traditional
classroom
setting
furthermore
it
requires
students
to
be
self motivated
and
have
good
time management
skills
in
order
to
successfully
complete
their
work
in
conclusion
the
decision
to
choose
public
school
or
distance
learning
should
be
based
on
individual
needs
and
preferences
learning
can
be
an
excellent
option
for
those
who
need
extra
flexibility
or
convenience
but
it
requires
students
to
be
dedicated
and
motivated
in
order
to
succeed
starting
a
successful
after
school
homework
club
does
n t
have
to
be
intimidating
there
are
several
key
steps
that
can
help
ensure
success
recruiting
the
right
members
is
essential
finding
students
who
are
motivated
to
get
their
homework
done
and
willing
to
be
part
of
a
club
environment
will
be
important
additionally
ensuring
a
comfortable
learning
environment
with
all
of
the
necessary
supplies
and
resources
for
students
to
work
on
their
homework
is
essential
second
setting
a
clear
and
realistic
goal
for
the
homework
club
is
critical
doing
smaller
assignments
that
are
achievable
will
help
the
student
build
confidence
in
their
ability
to
do
the
work
additionally
providing
rewards
such
as
recognition
or
fun
activities
like
game
or
movie
nights
can
also
encourage
learning
and
help
students
stay
motivated
finally
providing
the
right
kind
of
support
is
necessary
having
an
adult
facilitator
available
to
answer
questions
and
provide
guidance
can
help
students
develop
the
needed
skills
to
complete
their
work
additionally
forming
small
study
groups
or
creating
a
mentorship
program
can
help
foster
a
sense
of
community
and
help
students
build
relationships
with
their
peers
by
following
these
steps
we
can
establish
a
successful
after
school
homework
club
that
can
positively
benefit
student
achievement
the
four day
school
week
idea
has
the
potential
to
be
both
helpful
and
detrimental
for
students
in
certain
scenarios
the
increased
time
for
rest
and
relaxation
could
result
in
a
decrease
in
student
stress
allowing
them
to
give
their
best
efforts
in
class
however
the
shorter
school
week
could
reduce
the
students
amount
of
time
to
complete
other
activities
like
sport
or
extracurriculars
additionally
there
is
a
chance
that
it
may
have
a
lingering
negative
impact
on
students
future
success
as
fewer
days
in
the
school
week
could
equate
to
less
knowledge
and
a
lack
of
preparation
for
college
or
the
workforce
text

break
is
an
important
time
for
many
students
and
families
as
it
allows
an
opportunity
for
rest
and
relaxation
after
a
long
year
of
work
and
school
one
of
the
pros
of
summer
break
is
that
both
students
and
teachers
are
able
to
reduce
their
stress
levels
by
having
an
extended
period
of
time
off
from
their
studies
or
jobs
during
this
time
families
can
also
reconnect
and
bond
together
more
closely
as
they
have
an
extended
period
of
time
to
spend
at
home
away
from
the
pressures
of
day to day
life
additionally
students
have
the
option
of
taking
courses
over
the
summer
period
in
order
to
graduate
earlier
than
planned
is
a
country
full
of
history
culture
and
natural
beauty
it
is
known
for
its
stunning
beaches
lush
rainforests
and
diverse
wildlife
the
country
is
also
home
to
numerous
heritage
sites
and
archaeological
sites
showcasing
the
rich
history
of
the
region
aside
from
its
beauty
is
also
known
for
its
delicious
cuisine
and
array
of
flavorful
authentic
dishes
visiting
can
be
a
great
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
the
culture
as
well
as
to
enjoy
some
quality
time
with
the
family
not
only
do
visitors
get
to
experience
some
of
the
most
stunning
natural
beauty
in
the
world
but
they
also
benefit
from
cultural
exchanges
and
interactions
with
the
people
of
the
region
spending
time
with
family
while
in
is
also
a
great
way
to
create
memories
that
will
last
a
lifetime
creating
an
after school
homework
club
at
our
school
could
be
a
great
way
to
help
students
succeed
demonstrates
that
students
who
have
extra
support
with
their
homework
can
improve
their
academic
performance
over
the
long term
while
there
are
potential
challenges
to
creating
and
running
such
a
club
potential
solutions
exist
one
challenge
is
finding
a
way
to
recruit
and
introduce
students
to
the
club
students
need
to
be
made
aware
of
the
club
and
its
agenda
and
also
understand
that
it
is
a
safe
and
supportive
environment
we
could
use
word
of
mouth
as
well
as
flyers
email
and
other
methods
of
advertisement
another
issue
is
keeping
the
club
going
any
program
requires
long term
commitment
and
a
vision
for
the
future
we
could
maintain
and
increase
interest
and
commitment
with
regular
meetings
competitions
and
rewards
having
a
broad
and
engaging
agenda
would
help
to
keep
students
motivated
finally
an
important
challenge
is
finding
resources
and
help
for
running
the
club
we
could
seek
help
from
teachers
and
administrators
as
well
as
community
organizations
and
businesses
that
may
be
willing
to
contribute
resources
creating
an
after school
homework
club
not
only
offers
students
the
support
and
guidance
they
need
for
their
long term
academic
success
but
it
can
also
have
a
significant
impact
on
our
school
s
overall
performance
if
students
are
able
to
improve
their
skills
as
a
result
of
involvement
in
the
club
this
can
result
in
higher
test
scores
improved
grades
and
ultimately
increase
our
school
s
reputation
it
could
also
create
a
ripple
effect
throughout
our
local
community
which
could
have
a
lasting
effect
requiring
students
to
take
an
arts
class
has
both
positive
and
negative
aspects
on
the
one
hand
taking
a
class
such
as
music
theatre
or
art
may
help
students
gain
a
new
appreciation
for
the
arts
and
also
give
them
an
outlet
to
express
their
own
creativity
additionally
research
has
shown
that
taking
an
arts
class
can
help
students
to
develop
better
problem solving
skills
and
it
can
even
improve
overall
academic
performance
on
the
other
hand
requiring
students
to
take
an
arts
class
can
be
difficult
for
those
who
may
not
respond
well
to
being
evaluated
on
something
artistic
in
addition
if
students
feel
that
they
do
not
have
enough
time
to
devote
to
an
arts
class
this
can
lead
to
frustration
and
a
decrease
in
overall
motivation
throughout
my
life
i
ve
worked
to
find
my
own
personal
identity
i
ve
learned
from
s
inspiring
words
that
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
and
i
have
been
reflecting
on
my
own
life
journey
to
understand
my
identity
i
have
realized
that
there
are
moments
in
my
life
where
i
have
leaned
towards
becoming
whom
others
believe
i
should
be
and
then
moments
of
proud
self actualization
where
i
realized
my
own
potential
and
determination
to
be
who
i
want
to
be
from
my
experiences
in
discovering
my
own
identity
i
understand
now
that
there
can
be
immense
value
in
finding
autonomy
and
becoming
an
individual
it
allows
one
to
better
understand
themselves
and
their
goals
in
life
while
ensuring
that
they
create
goals
only
for
themselves
not
for
external
approval
to
continue
on
my
journey
of
self reflection
and
autonomy
i
am
creating
a
plan
to
focus
on
self growth
and
finding
what
makes
me
happiest
and
using
that
as
the
foundation
for
making
my
own
choices
this
plan
includes
setting
achievable
goals
that
place
the
value
of
my
own
opinion
and
well being
first
being
an
individual
reminds
me
of
the
power
i
have
to
make
my
own
decisions
and
i
believe
that
this
will
help
me
become
a
better
person
than
i
was
previously
when
it
comes
to
setting
curfews
for
teenagers
it
is
a
difficult
and
oftentimes
divisive
decision
between
parents
children
and
society
on
the
one
hand
setting
a
and
curfew
for
teenagers
instills
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
safety
it
sends
the
message
that
young
people
should
be
careful
about
the
choices
they
make
and
that
staying
out
too
late
can
put
them
at
risk
furthermore
it
can
provide
structure
and
ensure
that
teens
are
completing
their
educational
and
extracurricular
activities
and
getting
enough
sleep
to
remain
healthy
and
alert
for
the
next
day
on
the
other
hand
setting
such
a
restriction
on
teenagers
could
appear
to
be
an
attempt
to
prevent
them
from
exploring
the
world
and
engaging
in
age appropriate
activities
such
as
group
events
movies
or
other
extracurricular
activities
and
instead
keeps
them
at
home
in
a
supervised
environment
moreover
it
could
teach
young
people
that
their
parents
don
t
fully
trust
them
to
make
the
right
decisions
and
that
they
should
not
be
expected
to
be
in
control
of
their
own
lives
whether
or
not
to
set
a
and
curfew
for
teenagers
is
an
issue
that
must
be
weighed
carefully
it
is
important
to
consider
both
sides
of
the
argument
and
to
choose
the
best
course
of
action
that
works
for
each
individual
family
after
analyzing
the
pros
and
cons
of
keeping
the
current
school
lunch
menu
versus
changing
to
a
healthier
one
it
is
clear
that
there
would
be
several
advantages
of
making
the
change
with
healthier
options
students
would
have
more
nutritious
meals
leading
to
improved
health
and
better
overall
performance
this
would
save
time
and
money
that
would
have
otherwise
been
spent
on
visits
to
the
doctor
or
absenteeism
from
school
additionally
making
healthier
food
choices
has
the
potential
to
reduce
the
burden
on
other
resources
such
as
the
environment
based
on
this
analysis
i
recommend
that
the
school
adopts
the
new
healthier
lunch
menu
to
improve
student
health
and
wellbeing
save
costs
and
reduce
the
strain
on
other
resources

modern
students
often
debate
the
merits
of
classes
in
the
arts
being
required
versus
being
elective
while
some
argue
that
classes
in
the
arts
should
not
be
required
as
they
do
not
provide
students
with
practical
skills
for
future
employment
others
maintain
that
the
arts
can
provide
academic
and
personal
growth
expanding
students
worldviews
from
my
own
experience
taking
classes
in
the
arts
has
provided
me
with
a
better
appreciation
for
the
creative
process
and
non
linear
modes
of
thinking
it
has
also
developed
my
skills
in
collaboration
as
much
of
the
artistic
process
can
be
a
shared
effort
in
addition
i
have
found
that
the
classes
in
the
arts
have
provided
a
necessary
balance
between
academic
and
creative
pursuits
throughout
my
schooling
from
the
experiences
of
my
peers
and
other
sources
i
have
seen
the
positive
impact
that
classes
in
the
arts
can
have
on
developing
a
student
s
empathy
self expression
and
respect
for
the
perspectives
of
others
for
these
reasons
i
believe
that
classes
in
the
arts
have
significant
value
and
should
be
required
for
all
students
in
order
to
build
a
well rounded
educational
experience
when
students
are
exposed
to
the
creativity
and
unique
perspectives
that
classes
in
the
arts
provide
it
can
help
them
to
foster
imagination
explore
new
ideas
and
learn
the
capacities
for
excellence
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
quote
captures
the
truth
that
failure
and
enthusiasm
are
both
integral
parts
of
the
pursuit
of
success
is
filled
with
challenges
and
difficult
moments
and
the
courage
to
face
them
and
the
enthusiasm
to
drive
towards
our
ambitions
helps
us
to
reach
our
goals
failure
can
often
be
an
unpleasant
experience
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
keep
our
enthusiasm
when
failure
happens
we
must
remember
however
that
failure
is
often
part
of
the
journey
in
the
pursuit
of
success
failure
teaches
us
valuable
lessons
that
can
help
us
to
become
better
equipped
to
reach
our
goals
by
pressing
on
even
in
the
face
of
failure
we
gain
insight
into
what
works
and
what
does
n t
enabling
us
to
arrive
at
successes
that
may
not
have
been
achievable
had
we
given
up
in
the
face
of
adversity
is
also
essential
to
the
pursuit
of
success
it
helps
to
keep
us
motivated
and
inspired
and
when
coupled
with
courage
it
can
be
a
powerful
tool
in
overcoming
the
challenges
we
inevitably
encounter
on
our
journeys
if
we
possess
an
unshakeable
enthusiasm
we
can
stay
focused
on
our
goals
and
make
significant
strides
in
achieving
them
both
failure
and
enthusiasm
are
essential
part
of
a
successful
life
we
must
learn
to
embrace
failure
as
part
of
the
journey
and
to
keep
our
enthusiasm
alive
despite
challenges
and
setbacks
s
quote
is
a
reminder
of
this
important
truth
and
should
inspire
us
to
face
obstacles
with
courage
and
to
stay
committed
to
our
ambitions
with
enthusiasm
when
it
comes
to
making
important
decisions
in
life
seeking
guidance
from
experts
can
be
invaluable
it
is
important
to
research
the
various
resources
that
are
available
as
experts
can
be
especially
helpful
in
assessing
and
navigating
sensitive
issues
such
as
taxes
bills
and
relationships
taking
the
time
to
thoroughly
explore
the
resources
available
and
to
learn
more
about
how
such
experts
can
assist
is
a
necessary
step
in
finding
the
best informed
solutions
i
have
personally
sought
out
expert
advice
in
areas
such
as
taxes
and
financial
investments
and
doing
so
has
allowed
me
to
make
more
well informed
decisions
than
i
would
have
been
able
to
reach
on
my
own
through
this
avenue
i
also
learned
more
about
how
a
professional
opinion
can
be
just
as
valuable
as
an
informed
one
utilizing
the
resources
and
advice
of
professionals
can
help
you
make
better
decisions
and
ultimately
help
you
achieve
a
more
stable
and
secure
lifestyle
winter
is
an
incredibly
important
and
popular
time
for
breaks
as
it
has
historically
been
the
favorite
of
students
parents
and
teachers
alike
however
the
past
few
years
have
seen
an
increase
in
extreme
and
often
dangerous
snow
storms
which
has
led
some
to
consider
a
longer
winter
break
but
at
the
expense
of
shorter
summer
and
one week
fall
and
spring
breaks
while
the
idea
of
a
longer
winter
break
does
have
some
advantages
the
negative
consequences
could
be
significant
the
first
major
advantage
to
having
a
longer
winter
break
would
be
the
extra
time
students
get
to
spend
with
their
families
and
friends
creating
happy
memories
of
the
holidays
unfortunately
the
problems
this
could
cause
greatly
outweigh
the
benefits
with
a
longer
winter
break
students
will
miss
out
on
vital
instructional
time
that
is
crucial
for
their
mental
and
social
development
if
this
type
of
break
were
to
be
widespread
it
could
lead
to
significant
gaps
in
students
education
which
could
negatively
affect
their
academic
performance
longer
winter
break
may
also
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
overall
economy
experts
have
found
that
longer
breaks
can
discourage
spending
by
students
and
their
families
impacting
businesses
that
rely
on
the
additional
income
during
this
time
in
light
of
these
considerations
the
evidence
overwhelmingly
suggests
that
regular
summer
winter
and
spring
breaks
are
a
better
idea
regular
breaks
give
students
the
opportunity
to
learn
participate
in
recreational
activities
and
create
long lasting
memories
during
these
times
they
provide
the
perfect
balance
between
academic
development
and
leisure
activities
so
students
can
go
back
to
school
feeling
energized
and
ready
to
start
a
new
semester
regular
winter
breaks
also
keep
students
out
of
frigid
conditions
and
instead
allows
them
to
enjoy
the
comforts
of
home
in
a
safe
and
secure
environment
as
a
result
regular
summer
winter
and
spring
breaks
are
the
best
option
for
students
their
families
and
the
overall
economy
graduating
early
can
be
a
very
beneficial
way
to
further
a
student
s
education
or
career
but
there
are
some
potential
risks
that
should
be
considered
on
the
positive
side
graduating
early
can
allow
a
student
to
jump
ahead
in
their
college
or
job
career
it
may
enable
them
to
start
their
career
earlier
or
even
give
them
the
opportunity
to
pursue
further
education
or
specialized
courses
the
drawbacks
however
can
be
significant
early
graduates
may
not
be
as
prepared
as
their
peers
for
the
next
step
in
their
career
or
education
they
may
lack
the
polish
and
be
behind
in
certain
skills
needed
for
the
next
journey
they
would
also
miss
out
on
the
networking
connections
and
experiences
that
would
help
them
further
their
education
or
career
in
conclusion
graduating
early
can
be
a
great
way
to
benefit
a
student
s
education
and
career
prospects
however
potential
risks
and
drawbacks
must
be
weighed
against
the
potential
advantages
to
make
an
informed
decision
it
is
easy
to
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
trials
and
tribulations
that
life
throws
our
way
however
something
that
we
should
never
forget
is
the
value
of
a
single
act
of
kindness
in
the
face
of
difficulty
an
act
of
kindness
no
matter
how
small
can
provide
some
light
in
the
darkness
even
in
the
toughest
of
times
small
acts
of
kindness
like
a
smile
lending
a
hand
to
a
friend
in
need
or
simply
being
a
good
listener
can
be
enough
to
hold
onto
hope
and
stay
positive
when
faced
with
adversity
it
can
be
easy
to
forget
that
even
the
smallest
acts
of
kindness
are
enough
to
make
a
difference
can
help
us
to
appreciate
the
little
moments
that
make
life
special
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
a
cool
breeze
on
a
summer
evening
or
the
beauty
of
a
sunset
can
all
be
enjoyed
by
reaching
out
and
extending
a
kind
gesture
to
someone
who
might
be
struggling
in
doing
so
we
give
them
the
opportunity
to
experience
a
moment
of
joy
and
relief
we
are
all
connected
and
kindness
has
an
infinite
ripple
effect
isn
t
meant
to
be
measured it
s
meant
to
be
shared
as
such
no
act
of
kindness
no
matter
how
small
is
ever
wasted
whether
it
s
a
gesture
of
tenderness
compassion
or
simply
a
listening
ear
kindness
is
a
healing
balm
to
the
soul
it
has
the
power
to
lift
us
up
keep
us
positive
and
most
importantly
seize
the
day
no
matter
the
circumstances
self reliance
is
an
important
tool
for
making
decisions
and
feeling
secure
in
them
when
we
rely
on
ourselves
for
decision
making
we
take
full
ownership
of
the
choices
we
make
this
act
of
self determination
helps
us
feel
confident
in
the
decisions
we
make
no
matter
what
the
outcome
additionally
self reliance
encourages
us
to
prioritize
what
matters
most
in
life
so
we
can
focus
our
time
and
effort
on
what
really
matters
by
allowing
ourselves
to
take
responsibility
over
our
lives
we
can
better
identify
what
is
truly
meaningful
and
valuable
in
life
and
make
decisions
that
align
with
our
core
values
working
with
a
group
has
several
distinct
advantages
members
can
help
to
share
the
workload
bring
different
skill
sets
and
perspectives
to
the
project
and
may
even
offer
encouragement
and
support
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
has
its
own
advantages
as
well
as
it
allows
for
quicker
decision
making
fewer
delays
and
complete
autonomy
over
the
project
however
a
group
experience
also
carries
some
distinct
disadvantages
projects
can
be
complicated
by
conflicting
opinions
and
ideas
communication
issues
and
the
challenge
of
managing
a
cohesive
team
in
contrast
working
alone
carries
the
risk
of
project
stagnation
limited
resources
and
a
greater
challenge
in
staying
motivated
overall
both
approaches
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
depending
on
the
project
and
the
team
working
with
a
group
may
be
a
better
fit
when
tackling
a
complicated
project
while
a
small
project
may
be
best
suited
for
working
alone
ultimately
the
best
approach
will
depend
on
the
project
goals
and
the
individuals
involved
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
way
we
communicate
and
shop
for
better
or
for
worse
social
media
and
video
conferencing
have
made
it
possible
for
people
all
over
the
world
to
communicate
with
ease
allowing
us
to
build
long distance
relationships
and
engage
in
virtual
conversations
on
the
other
hand
online
marketplaces
and
apps
have
made
it
incredibly
easy
to
purchase
goods
from
the
comfort
of
our
own
homes
meaning
we
may
be
missing
out
on
the
joys
of
the
traditional
in person
shopping
experience
the
role
of
technology
in
schools
has
been
a
subject
of
debate
for
many
years
while
there
is
no
denying
that
technology
has
made
education
more
accessible
to
students
the
decrease
in
in person
interaction
has
led
to
a
disconnect
between
teachers
and
students
resulting
in
a
level
of
academic
disengagement
never
seen
before
moreover
people
have
become
increasingly
dependent
on
technology
in
recent
years
from
search
engines
to
robots
technology
is
everywhere
we
turn
and
is
even
used
to
make
life
decisions
such
as
what
kind
of
healthcare
or
the
best
school
for
our
children
this
high
reliance
on
technology
can
result
in
people
being
over dependent
making
it
difficult
for
them
to
function
without
it
without
technology
the
world
we
live
in
today
would
be
dramatically
different
most
communication
would
be
done
through
written
letters
goods
would
have
to
be
purchased
from
physical
stores
and
access
to
education
would
be
limited
among
many
other
changes
technology
has
undeniably
shaped
our
lives
and
while
it
can
be
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
it
is
here
to
stay
technology
has
revolutionized
many
aspects
of
our
lives
and
its
impact
on
physical
and
mental
health
communication
in
relationships
and
the
benefits
of
in person
interaction
is
undeniable
recent
research
has
shown
that
increased
technology
usage
can
create
feelings
of
isolation
depression
and
anxiety
leading
to
physical
issues
such
as
sleep
deprivation
muscle
aches
and
headaches
the
role
of
technology
in
communication
in
relationships
can
also
be
significant
while
it
can
facilitate
communication
and
stay
in
touch
with
faraway
loved
ones
its
use
can
also
facilitate
a
superficial
connection
with
problems
that
can
manifest
in
the
long
term
additionally
in person
interactions
provide
a
profoundly
different
experience
than
doing
most
activities
online
interacting
with
someone
in
person
provides
an
emotional
and
sensory
connection
that
can
t
be
replicated
with
technology
such
as
meeting
with
a
friend
to
discuss
a
problem
or
purchasing
an
item
in
a
store
and
being
able
to
physically
inspect
it
however
it
s
important
to
exercise
caution
and
restraint
when
relying
on
technology
too
much
reliance
on
technology
can
create
a
disconnect
between
people
and
their
physical
environment
leading
to
decreased
empathy
and
social
skills
less
physical
activity
and
greater
disconnection
with
the
real
world
staying
actively
engaged
and
participating
in
activities
has
been
linked
to
many
positive
results
ranging
from
physical
health
benefits
to
improved
mental
wellbeing
active
lifestyles
in
comparison
to
idle
lifestyles
offer
numerous
advantages
that
encourage
physical
mental
and
emotional
growth
in
a
workplace
setting
those
who
demonstrate
a
willingness
to
contribute
are
seen
as
motivated
and
committed
to
their
work
providing
an
example
to
colleagues
and
potentially
resulting
in
rewards
and
recognition
there
are
a
number
of
notable
cases
of
individuals
whose
lives
have
been
improved
by
actively
engaging
in
activities
these
positive
outcomes
are
often
more
tangible
than
those
that
come
with
idleness
if
a
person
fails
to
stay
motivated
and
productive
they
risk
remaining
stagnant
in
their
personal
progress
and
achievements
therefore
it
is
imperative
for
people
to
strive
to
stay
engaged
in
activities
that
shape
and
inform
their
lives
allowing
them
to
grow
in
a
meaningful
way
technology
has
become
a
ubiquitous
part
of
modern
life
impacting
us
both
positively
and
negatively
on
the
one
hand
the
increased
use
of
technology
has
diminished
the
amount
of
face to face
contact
leading
to
heightened
levels
of
isolation
and
loneliness
among
many
people
on
the
other
hand
technology
has
allowed
us
to
accomplish
tasks
more
efficiently
and
widened
our
access
to
information
and
resources
one
area
in
which
technology
is
seen
as
especially
beneficial
is
in
helping
older
people
to
manage
their
medical
needs
technology
has
enabled
advancements
that
allow
seniors
to
monitor
their
health
and
access
medical
assistance
remotely
while
also
connecting
them
to
family
members
or
caregivers
students
also
reap
the
rewards
of
technology
as
increased
access
to
computers
and
the
internet
means
they
can
access
information
and
resources
more
easily
than
ever
before
this
also
allows
them
to
communicate
with
their
peers
and
teachers
more
effectively
than
in
the
past
lastly
prolonged
use
of
technology
does
come
with
some
drawbacks
of
electronics
can
be
damaging
to
a
person
s
physical
and
mental
health
leading
to
eyestrain
headaches
and
poor
posture
additionally
too
much
screen
time
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
social
and
emotional
development
in
conclusion
while
technology
has
both
positive
and
negative
impacts
on
our
lives
it
is
ultimately
up
to
us
to
limit
the
less
beneficial
aspects
of
it
and
take
advantage
of
the
useful
ones
in
the
past
many
individuals
have
had
a
lasting
and
positive
impact
on
society
for
example
a
prominent
leader
in
the
century
women
s
rights
movement
was
instrumental
in
the
passage
of
the
allowing
women
to
vote
in
the
this
changed
the
way
society
views
women
and
set
an
important
precedent
for
other
advancements
in
the
rights
of
women
in
the
following
decades
compare
this
to
today
s
accomplishments
which
are
more
diverse
and
numerous
we
have
seen
a
trend
of
advocacy
in
the
rights
of
minorities
women
people
of
color
and
people
as
well
as
an
increase
in
social
movements
such
as
the
lives
and
we
ve
come
a
long
way
since
s
time
but
the
inactivity
of
past
generations
still
heavily
affects
the
society
of
today
if
prior
generations
had
paid
attention
to
the
injustices
that
still
plague
our
world
today
and
had
created
more
tangible
reforms
the
present
would
look
very
different
going
forward
it
is
up
to
us
to
shape
a
better
future
for
the
generations
to
come
we
must
focus
on
creating
better
policies
and
regulations
to
ensure
that
everyone
is
able
to
live
a
fair
and
equitable
life
we
must
use
the
lessons
of
the
past
to
move
forward
and
create
lasting
positive
change
in
our
society
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
offer
its
own
set
of
unique
benefits
and
challenges
academically
young
people
may
have
the
opportunity
to
specialize
in
their
field
of
choice
early
on
in
their
learning
journey
this
can
help
give
them
a
distinct
advantage
when
they
enter
the
workforce
young
individuals
may
be
able
to
start
earning
money
and
accumulating
wealth
earlier
depending
on
their
level
of
education
and
experience
on
a
personal
level
it
can
provide
focus
and
structure
in
a
person
s
life
at
a
young
age
and
can
help
steer
them
towards
a
fulfilling
career
however
there
can
be
some
downsides
to
committing
to
a
career
too
early
such
as
missing
out
on
the
valuable
time
of
exploration
that
many
teens
enjoy
furthermore
there
is
a
greater
risk
of
changing
industries
or
jobs
later
on
if
a
career
does
n t
work
out
as
planned
finally
teens
may
not
yet
possess
the
knowledge
and
experience
they
need
to
excel
in
a
professional
setting
all
in
all
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
while
it
can
offer
a
unique
set
of
benefits
it
s
important
to
consider
the
challenges
that
teens
may
face
in
the
process
and
weigh
the
decision
carefully
after
conducting
extensive
research
on
the
effects
of
a
four day
work
week
on
businesses
it
has
become
clear
that
there
are
multiple
advantages
such
as
improved
focus
flexibility
and
job
satisfaction
among
employees
in
addition
a
four day
school
week
can
provide
more
time
for
teaching
and
more
space
for
students
to
do
their
homework
although
there
are
potential
benefits
to
the
change
there
are
also
possible
disadvantages
for
example
students
may
miss
out
on
classes
or
be
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
curriculum
and
homework
it
is
also
worth
investigating
how
inadequate
sleep
can
affect
students
and
how
a
four day
school
week
would
help
address
that
issue
ultimately
a
thorough
exam
of
the
implications
of
extending
the
four day
school
week
has
the
potential
to
make
significant
improvements
to
the
educational
experience
for
students
it
is
often
said
that
attitude
is
everything
and
this
is
especially
true
when
it
comes
to
success
in
life
positive
thinking
has
been
proven
time
and
time
again
to
be
a
key
component
of
achieving
both
short term
and
long term
successes
from
more
mundane
everyday
accomplishments
to
reaching
our
biggest
dreams
positive
thinking
is
the
practice
of
choosing
to
focus
on
the
good
rather
than
the
bad
in
any
situation
and
thereby
engage
with
life
more
positively
and
productively
when
we
choose
to
focus
on
the
good
in
a
situation
our
stress
and
anxiety
levels
tend
to
decrease
this
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
our
mental
health
and
the
ability
to
cope
with
challenging
situations
positive
thinking
can
help
us
look
at
problems
from
a
different
perspective
and
push
us
to
pursue
solutions
this
can
also
increase
our
emotional
intelligence
which
in
turn
can
lead
to
better
communication
and
relationships
with
those
around
us
furthermore
positive
thinking
can
bolster
our
self confidence
and
encourage
us
to
pursue
opportunities
for
growth
and
advancement
knowing
that
we
can
take
on
challenges
that
we
can
push
our
limits
and
still
come
out
on
top
is
a
powerfuliumph
of
positivityhedge
courage
in
our
own
capabilities
and
can
be
hugely
motivational
striving
for
success
is
so
much
easier
when
we
re
not
constantly
putting
ourselves
down
and
expecting
failure
ultimately
choosing
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
important
steps
we
can
take
towards
a
successful
life
to
embrace
the
positivity
potential
within
ourselves
and
our
experiences
is
to
open
ourselves
up
to
the
possibility
of
a
life
full
of
growth
and
accomplishment
making
your
own
decisions
and
doing
things
that
you
enjoy
in
life
are
the
keys
to
creating
the
greatest
successes
the
world
will
always
tell
you
what
to
do
and
who
to
be
and
though
it
might
seem
easier
to
succumb
to
those
pressures
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
is
not
the
right
way
to
achieve
success
when
we
are
given
opportunities
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
pursue
what
we
find
interesting
or
fulfilling
we
open
up
many
new
doors
that
the
world
ca
n t
offer
this
allows
us
to
develop
our
skills
and
gain
unique
experiences
that
can
ultimately
lead
to
a
much
greater
success
than
simply
following
what
someone
else
says
taking
the
time
to
make
our
own
decisions
can
also
help
to
solidify
our
sense
of
identity
it
can
be
easy
to
begin
following
what
the
world
wants
us
to
be
but
this
is
in
direct
opposition
to
finding
out
who
we
are
and
who
we
want
to
be
we
can
only
truly
be
successful
when
we
are
being
true
to
ourselves
and
embracing
our
individual
strengths
we
can
accomplish
so
much
more
when
our
decisions
and
pursuits
are
in
line
with
who
we
are
as
people
instead
of
trying
to
fit
a
mold
that
someone
else
has
created
making
our
own
decisions
and
doing
things
that
we
enjoy
in
life
can
lead
to
greater
successes
than
simply
following
what
the
world
wants
us
to
be
this
is
why
it
is
so
important
to
take
the
time
to
pursue
our
own
individual
paths
and
discover
what
truly
brings
us
joy
working
in
groups
could
be
both
beneficial
and
productive
for
both
the
students
and
the
teachers
groups
can
make
it
easier
for
college
students
to
learn
and
comprehend
difficult
material
because
they
can
collaborate
on
ideas
provide
different
solutions
and
work
together
to
come
up
with
the
best
answer
also
provide
a
safe
space
where
students
can
ask
questions
without
feeling
embarrassed
or
intimidated
for
teachers
groups
can
be
a
great
way
to
keep
the
students
engaged
it
encourages
students
to
participate
in
the
lesson
and
become
part
of
the
process
rather
than
passively
listening
to
a
lecture
using
group
work
also
allows
for
different
teaching
styles
and
methods
to
be
used
by
the
teacher
like
simulations
group
games
and
problem solving
activities
these
activities
can
help
to
give
students
an
in depth
understanding
of
the
content
by
providing
a
more
hands on
approach
that
encourages
critical
thinking
working
in
groups
can
also
give
teachers
more
time
to
help
individual
students
with
their
unique
needs
as
the
other
students
in
the
group
are
doing
the
work
in
conclusion
working
in
groups
in
the
classroom
can
be
a
productive
and
beneficial
experience
for
both
the
students
and
the
teachers
the
different
activities
and
collaborative
work
in
groups
can
help
students
to
better
understand
the
material
while
the
different
teaching
methods
used
can
engage
the
students
and
make
the
learning
process
more
enjoyable
the
life
experiences
we
encounter
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
our
understanding
of
the
world
and
our
own
behavior
for
example
research
has
shown
that
a
person
s
upbringing
has
an
important
role
in
shaping
their
understanding
of
the
world
and
the
behavior
they
accept
as
normal
additionally
external
events
like
death
physical
illness
or
injury
and
even
day to day
decisions
can
cause
dramatic
behavioral
changes
it
is
important
for
individuals
to
become
aware
of
how
their
life
experiences
have
influenced
them
so
they
can
take
control
of
their
own
lives
and
use
the
hardships
they
have
gone
through
to
become
stronger
by
consciously
making
decisions
with
an
awareness
of
our
own
individual
experiences
we
are
better
able
to
weigh
our
options
and
make
decisions
that
are
in
our
best
interest
taking
ownership
of
our
lives
and
learning
from
the
hardships
life
throws
our
way
can
ultimately
help
us
become
more
resilient
and
better
equipped
to
handle
future
challenges
studies
have
shown
that
in
the
states
students
from
kindergarten
to
twelfth
grade
have
received
systematic
instruction
of
less
than
months
a
year
with
short
summer
vacations
in
between
summer
breaks
are
often
seen
in
other
countries
with
some
countries
dedicating
up
to
months
of
consecutive
instruction
although
reducing
summer
break
could
provide
students
with
more
of
an
opportunity
for
class
instruction
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
negatives
that
come
with
it
not
only
can
these
longer
school
years
disrupt
the
plans
and
goals
of
the
students
but
it
can
also
affect
family
dynamics
when
parents
are
unable
to
take
a
substantial
break
from
employment
responsibilities
when
considering
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
month
school
year
it
is
best
to
look
at
the
harmful
and
helpful
advantages
to
students
longer
break
provides
much needed
restoration
and
respite
for
students
and
lets
them
take
control
of
their
dreams
yet
a
longer
school
year
can
also
be
detrimental
to
students
mental
and
physical
health
due
to
the
lack
of
adequate
rest
and
breaks
throughout
the
year
when
considering
these
factors
it
is
important
for
school
systems
to
take
into
account
the
student
s
dreams
and
life
aspirations
changes
and
modifications
need
to
be
made
in
order
to
ensure
the
wellbeing
of
the
students
this
includes
giving
them
enough
space
to
pursue
their
personal
interests
while
also
maintaining
their
studies
my
elementary
school
students
were
excited
when
i
unveiled
my
art
project
to
them
the
task
to
create
a
mural
together
illustrating
the
importance
of
patience
creativity
and
focus
i
could
see
the
determination
to
complete
it
properly
on
their
faces
as
the
days
passed
and
the
mural
started
to
take
shape
i
could
see
the
joy
they
got
from
seeing
how
they
each
lent
their
own
unique
contributions
rendered
in
bright
colors
the
mural
depicted
our
class
standing
in
a
variety
of
poses
and
positions
each
student
was
given
the
freedom
to
create
their
own
painting
giving
the
mural
as
a
whole
a
unique
and
personalized
effect
all
their
hard
work
painstaking
focus
and
creativity
paid
off
when
the
mural
was
finally
completed the
result
was
a
stunning
artwork
that
filled
everyone
with
immense
pride
the
art
project
highlighted
to
the
students
how
patience
creativity
and
focus
are
essential
to
achieve
amazing
results
not
only
did
they
learn
the
importance
of
these
virtues
they
also
experienced
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
earned
the
satisfaction
and
joy
of
creating
something
they
could
all
be
proud
of
playing
the
violin
requires
attention
to
the
proper
bowing
technique
when
starting
out
it
s
important
to
understand
the
fundamentals
of
how
to
properly
hold
and
use
the
bow
for
example
make
sure
the
hair
of
the
bow
is
centered
and
not
drooping
and
that
the
bow
is
parallel
to
the
bridge
of
the
violin
additionally
practice
keeping
the
bow
straight
like
a
pencil
and
the
arm
movements
relaxed
also
employs
a
set
of
fundamentals
which
involves
an
understanding
of
ingredients
how
they
interact
and
how
to
combine
flavors
learning
recipes
can
help
teach
these
fundamentals
cookies
and
enchiladas
are
all
great
recipes
to
explore
that
have
numerous
different
possibilities
experiment
with
different
proportions
and
techniques
to
discover
flavors
and
textures
that
work
best
for
you
artistry
is
another
creative
activity
that
has
a
lot
of
room
to
experiment
with
techniques
and
different
color
palettes
to
mix
and
create
different
looks
get
creative
with
the
different
face
shapes
and
skin
tones
and
keep
records
of
what
works
well
for
you
remember
to
keep
practicing
and
have
fun
using
imagination
and
creativity
is
incredibly
useful
and
important
in
many
jobs
and
fields
writers
artists
fashion
designers
singers
and
photographers
are
just
a
few
examples
of
roles
in
which
one
must
use
their
creative
skills
and
imaginations
skills
associated
with
these
creative
roles
are
artistic
vision
storytelling
abilities
musical
flair
understanding
of
color
and
the
ability
to
craft
unique
ideas
for
instance
fashion
designer
used
her
imagination
and
creative
vision
to
dress
and
redefine
women
s
wardrobes
with
her
signature
wrap dress
musician
utilized
his
rap
skills
to
tell
creative
stories
and
deliver
unique
messages
creative
thinking
and
the
ability
to
imagine
is
not
only
important
in
the
workplace
but
also
in
everyday
life
one
way
to
use
imagination
and
creativity
in
everyday
life
is
to
approach
a
problem
from
a
new
perspective
for
example
if
something
is
n t
working
think
of
creative
solutions
that
could
help
overcome
any
challenges
imagination
and
creativity
can
also
be
used
to
explore
new
hobbies
or
interests
such
as
painting
a
picture
or
creating
a
project
everyone
has
the
potential
to
use
their
imagination
and
creativity
the
only
limit
is
your
own
mind
phones
have
become
increasingly
integrated
into
our
daily
lives
and
many
argue
that
the
technology
should
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
after
all
cell
phones
are
a
powerful
tool
that
can
be
used
to
enhance
learning
facilitate
collaboration
between
students
and
with
other
technology
with
the
proper
supervision
and
usage
restrictions
cell
phones
can
be
used
to
supplement
lessons
and
engage
students
in
ways
that
simply
were
n t
possible
before
on
the
other
hand
many
people
argue
that
cell
phones
are
disruptive
in
the
classroom
and
have
even
been
shown
to
decrease
overall
grades
allowing
phones
can
draw
students
attention
away
from
lessons
and
give
them
an
avenue
to
access
distractions
like
social
media
and
gaming
apps
during
class
furthermore
concerns
over
cheating
become
more
real
when
smartphones
are
allowed
in
school
and
can
lead
to
unfair
academic
assessments
ultimately
it
is
up
to
schools
to
decide
if
and
how
to
allow
cell
phones
to
be
used
in
the
classroom
both
sides
have
valid
arguments
and
teacher
should
consider
the
needs
of
their
particular
classroom
before
implementing
a
policy
the
current
educational
climate
has
enabled
students
to
attend
classes
from
home
more
and
more
this
shift
brings
with
it
both
benefits
to
students
as
well
as
drawbacks
that
could
hinder
their
education
while
attending
classes
from
home
undoubtedly
brings
convenience
in
terms
of
scheduling
and
accessibility
it
also
has
consequences
on
a
student
s
ability
to
stay
focused
and
remain
engaged
in
school
one
of
the
biggest
benefits
of
students
attending
classes
from
home
is
the
flexibility
it
gives
both
students
and
their
families
studies
show
that
having
flexible
learning
options
can
result
in
students
better
managing
their
own
schedules
and
being
able
to
take
care
of
other
responsibilities
while
still
attending
class
this
is
especially
beneficial
for
students
who
may
have
family
or
work
obligations
that
need
to
be
balanced
alongside
their
schooling
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
students
attending
classes
from
home
is
that
it
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
stay
engaged
and
connected
with
the
material
they
re
learning
without
the
presence
of
a
teacher
or
classmates
students
can
struggle
to
focus
on
their
assignments
and
have
a
more
difficult
time
retaining
information
to
combat
this
issue
educational
systems
should
emphasize
more
interaction
and
communication
within
their
classes
for
example
students
could
be
encouraged
to
have
weekly
online
discussions
with
their
peers
or
partake
in
interactive
video
tutorials
and
activities
that
keep
them
engaged
in
the
material
in
conclusion
while
students
attending
classes
from
home
offers
convenience
and
flexibility
more
will
need
to
be
done
to
ensure
student
engagement
and
maintain
educational
standards
this
can
also
enable
students
to
become
more
self directed
in
their
studies
allowing
them
to
better
manage
their
obligations
and
still
stay
on
top
of
their
schooling
many
successful
individuals
have
triumphed
despite
innumerable
failures
take
the
famous
basketball
player
for
example
despite
being
cut
from
his
high
school
basketball
team
he
remained
enthusiastic
and
kept
practicing
until
he
moved
forward
and
eventually
became
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
his
skill
techniques
knowledge
of
the
game
and
his
hard
work
and
dedication
were
the
factors
that
enabled
him
to
achieve
success
it
is
essential
to
never
give
up
and
stay
enthusiastic
despite
whatever
struggles
may
occur
these
qualities
can
help
anyone
achieve
anything
even
those
individuals
who
may
have
felt
that
their
ultimate
goals
and
dreams
were
impossible
for
example
if
an
individual
can
focus
on
learning
each
failure
then
develop
a
method
or
strategy
to
attain
success
he she
can
conquer
any
challenge
that
they
might
encounter
as
long
as
a
person
stays
focused
and
focused
on
their
own
enthusiasm
they
will
continue
to
try
and
have
an
optimistic
outcome
s
story
is
a
great
demonstration
of
how
success
can
still
be
achieved
despite
failure
his
determination
and
enthusiasm
allowed
him
to
change
non believers
into
believers
and
to
achieve
success
his
example
shows
that
success
is
possible
and
that
no
matter
how
many
times
failure
occurs
success
can
still
be
accomplished
by
channeling
enthusiasm
and
never
giving
up
technology
has
rapidly
become
a
vital
part
of
our
everyday
lives
from
keeping
us
connected
to
loved
ones
with
smartphones
to
assisting
doctors
with
diagnosing
illnesses
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
live
however
these
advancements
have
not
come
without
potential
drawbacks
in
this
essay
i
will
explore
both
the
good
and
bad
effects
technology
has
had
on
individuals
and
society
alike
on
an
individual
level
technology
has
made
life
much
simpler
we
no
longer
need
to
leave
our
homes
to
pay
bills
or
shop
for
groceries
as
we
can
easily
do
it
all
online
we
can
keep
all
our
important
documents
and
photos
in
the
cloud
meaning
we
don
t
have
to
worry
about
losing
them
if
our
hard
drive
decides
to
crash
it
has
also
made
communication
much
easier
as
we
can
now
easily
keep
in
contact
with
people
all
over
the
world
via
video
chat
or
instant
messaging
services
however
too
much
reliance
on
technology
can
lead
to
various
problems
people
can
become
isolated
if
they
spend
too
much
time
on
their
digital
devices
leading
to
problems
with
communication
also
since
many
people
are
now
using
technology
to
pay
bills
it
can
be
easier
to
overspend
as
we
no
longer
have
the
physical
reminder
of
cash
being
taken
out
of
our
wallets
when
it
comes
to
society
technology
has
done
a
lot
of
good
the
internet
has
enabled
people
to
access
previously
unavailable
information
meaning
they
are
more
informed
and
can
make
better
decisions
it
has
also
created
opportunities
such
as
telecommuting
jobs
that
allow
people
to
make
a
living
without
having
to
leave
their
homes
however
technology
has
also
had
its
share
of
drawbacks
it
has
contributed
to
the
rise
of
cybercrime
as
malicious
actors
can
now
easily
target
people
online
it
has
also
caused
several
privacy
issues
with
people
s
personal
information
being
shared
with
companies
without
their
knowledge
in
conclusion
technology
has
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
individuals
and
society
while
the
positives
are
undeniable
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
risks
associated
with
technology
so
that
we
can
better
understand
how
to
make
the
most
of
these
advancements
without
causing
further
harm
developing
the
skills
and
knowledge
necessary
to
make
progress
towards
our
goals
and
continue
to
learn
new
things
is
essential
to
success
in
life
being
constantly
engaged
in
life
and
learning
is
extremely
important
as
it
provides
us
with
the
opportunity
to
grow
and
develop
our
abilities
for
example
becoming
passively
involved
in
activities
or
ceasing
to
strive
for
progress
will
not
yield
the
desired
results
it
is
only
through
taking
an
active
role
in
gaining
knowledge
and
putting
it
to
use
that
positive
results
and
growth
can
be
observed
with
consistent
effort
dedication
and
practice
any
goal
can
be
achieved
regardless
of
the
difficulty
in
order
to
keep
learning
new
things
and
keep
progressing
towards
a
goal
it
is
vital
to
constantly
be
striving
forward
no
progress
will
be
made
if
one
is
not
actively
striving
for
success
in
all
aspects
of
life
it
is
by
taking
the
initiative
and
having
determination
that
progress
can
be
made
and
the
goal
can
be
reached
being
yourself
may
not
always
be
the
most
natural
or
easy
approach
in
life
and
many
of
us
go
out
of
our
way
to
try
and
be
someone
we
are
not
in
order
to
fit
in
or
make
others
happy
however
embracing
the
idea
of
not
being
yourself
and
departing
from
expectations
and
obligations
can
often
be
an
accomplishment
after
all
it
takes
courage
and
an
independent
mindset
to
make
decisions
for
yourself
and
go
against
the
grain
of
what
is
expected
take
for
example
the
classic
story
of
a
person
from
a
conservative
family
who
may
be
expected
to
pursue
a
certain
career
or
study
specific
subjects
but
harbors
a
passion
for
something
completely
different
to
go
against
expectations
and
pursue
the
path
you
really
want
to
be
on
is
a
brave
choice
to
make
but
it
is
also
necessary
for
a
fulfilling
life
flexible
and
adaptable
to
new
opportunities
and
experiences
can
open
up
our
lives
to
unimaginable
possibilities
that
could
not
have
been
forecasted
one
thing
to
remember
is
that
while
it
is
important
to
be
yourself
and
be
independent
it
is
equally
important
to
still
be
mindful
of
rules
and
regulations
there
are
always
consequences
both
positive
and
negative
to
following
or
not
following
rules
making
decisions
that
respect
authority
can
be
an
integral
part
of
success
in
many
areas
of
life
and
following
the
rules
may
provide
a
much needed
structure
or
sense
of
security
ultimately
though
at
the
end
of
the
day
having
the
power
to
make
our
own
decisions
for
that
one
person
who
grew
up
in
a
conservative
family
is
a
testament
to
a
successful
life
journey
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
many
great
benefits
from
improved
problem solving
abilities
to
increased
creativity
having
a
positive
outlook
can
bring
amazing
rewards
by
learning
how
to
approach
problems
with
a
can
do
mentality
individuals
can
develop
a
resilience
that
allows
them
to
cope
with
challenging
situations
with
a
positive
attitude
individuals
can
begin
to
look
at
difficult
circumstances
as
an
opportunity
for
growth
a
positive
attitude
can
inspire
creativity
and
provide
the
motivation
necessary
to
tackle
problematic
scenarios
in
innovative
ways
by
remaining
hopeful
and
optimistic
in
the
face
of
setbacks
individuals
can
look
on
the
bright
side
and
find
the
courage
and
determination
to
persevere
when
surrounded
by
others
who
have
a
positive
attitude
individuals
can
benefit
from
a
sense
of
shared
courage
and
support
having
access
to
this
type
of
positive
reinforcement
can
buoy
individuals
during
difficult
times
while
encouraging
them
to
dream
bigger
and
strive
harder
a
positive
attitude
can
even
lead
to
greater
self confidence
as
individuals
become
better
able
to
face
and
ultimately
overcome
their
fears
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
not
only
is
it
able
to
provide
the
needed
spark
of
creativity
and
motivation
but
it
can
also
lead
to
greater
confidence
greater
resilience
and
the
ability
to
better
handlechallenges
that
come
our
way
with
thisimportant
skill
individuals
can
open
up
the
door
to
some
amazing
possibilities
the
idea
of
a
four day
school
week
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
among
school
districts
nationwide
the
concept
holds
promise
as
districts
would
be
able
to
save
money
on
transportation
and
other
expenses
however
the
effects
on
students
must
be
taken
into
consideration
as
well
on
the
positive
side
students
may
benefit
from
having
three day
weekends
on
a
regular
basis
resulting
in
higher
attendance
and
engagement
for
working
parents
a
four day
workweek
could
also
provide
a
reliable
childcare
option
in
addition
research
has
shown
that
students
learn
more
effectively
with
more
frequent
breaks
in
their
instruction
and
that
shorter
days
can
be
better
at
improving
overall
student
achievement
on
the
other
hand
there
are
potential
drawbacks
to
a
four day
school
week
for
example
it
might
be
difficult
for
students
and
staff
to
adjust
to
such
a
drastic
change
in
their
daily
routine
there
is
also
the
concern
that
students
may
fall
behind
in
their
studies
due
to
the
longer
days
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
week
additionally
if
schools
switch
to
this
model
they
could
face
challenges
in
scheduling
after school
activities
and
providing
resources
for
students
who
need
extra
help
ultimately
any
decision
to
transition
to
a
four day
school
week
should
be
based
on
an
extensive
analysis
of
the
costs
and
benefits
as
well
as
careful
consideration
of
how
it
might
affect
the
academic
performance
of
students
learning
from
other
people
s
experiences
can
be
an
invaluable
resource
whether
it
s
hearing
stories
about
someone
s
successes
or
struggling
with
their
own
journey
taking
time
to
listen
to
and
learn
from
someone
else
s
experiences
is
often
the
best
way
to
make
sure
we
do
n t
make
the
same
mistakes
knowing
someone
else
s
challenges
and
their
solutions
ahead
of
time
can
help
us
steer
clear
of
potential
pitfalls
on
a
larger
scale
learning
from
other
s
experiences
can
help
us
understand
the
nature
of
reality
better
and
put
us
in
a
better
position
to
make
more
informed
decisions
by
gaining
insights
from
those
who
have
gone
before
us
we
can
become
more
prepared
for
our
own
experiences
we
can
study
their
approaches
their
successes
and
their
failures
and
use
that
knowledge
to
our
advantage
moreover
learning
from
other
people
s
experiences
allows
us
to
develop
connections
with
others
by
building
relationships
and
sharing
ideas
when
we
help
others
out
we
create
bonds
that
can
last
a
lifetime
we
learn
from
the
past
but
more
importantly
we
build
for
the
future
in
short
learning
from
other
people
s
experiences
is
an
indispensable
tool
for
achieving
a
better
life
stories
about
others
successes
and
failures
can
make
us
more
informed
and
get
us
better
prepared
for
our
own
journey
through
life
we
can
pick
the
brains
of
people
who
have
gone
before
us
build
relationships
and
grow
together
in
this
way
learning
from
other
people
s
experiences
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
personal
and
collective
growth
the
debate
continues
over
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
curfew
on
teenagers
between
the
ages
of
to
on
one
side
the
curfew
may
be
seen
as
beneficial
due
to
the
structure
and
protection
it
provides
to
them
during
the
weekend
a
midnight
curfew
on
the
weekends
provides
teens
with
the
opportunity
do
positive
activities
such
as
homework
and
getting
extra
sleep
while
avoiding
the
potential
dangers
associated
with
being
out
late
at
night
it
also
forces
teens
to
prioritize
their
extracurriculars
and
other
activities
allowing
them
to
focus
on
their
education
on
the
other
hand
imposing
a
weekday
curfew
of
may
be
seen
as
too
restrictive
for
teenagers
who
need
to
take
part
in
activities
that
will
be
beneficial
for
their
futures
without
the
opportunity
to
attend
extracurriculars
and
engage
in
after school
activities
such
as
internships
and
volunteer
work
certain
teens
may
face
a
disadvantage
when
it
comes
to
the
college
admissions
game
and
even
job
applications
a
strict
curfew
can
make
teens
feel
isolated
as
if
belonging
to
a
family
or
community
is
denied
this
can
lead
to
teenagers
feeling
unwelcome
in
their
own
homes
resulting
in
depression
and
even
delinquency
therefore
when
it
comes
to
implementing
a
curfew
on
teenagers
between
the
ages
of
to
it
is
important
to
consider
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
the
midnight
weekend
curfew
and
the
p m
weekday
curfew
on
the
one
hand
a
curfew
can
foster
a
feeling
of
safety
and
security
for
teens
on
the
other
hand
it
can
impose
unfair
restrictions
hindering
them
from
succeeding
academically
emotionally
and
economically
most
common
societies
expect
students
to
identify
a
career
by
the
age
of
or
personally
i
think
the
best
age
to
start
figuring
out
a
career
path
is
as
soon
as
one
can
young
people
are
often
faced
with
difficult
decisions
such
as
deciding
which
college
to
attend
or
what
job
to
pursue
when
my
parents
gave
me
four
years
to
decide
on
a
career
i
was
overwhelmed
and
questioned
if
i
was
making
the
right
decision
my
advice
to
young
people
who
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
career
path
to
follow
is
to
talk
to
mentors
explore
different
opportunities
and
trust
that
you
can
make
decisions
that
will
help
shape
your
future
one
of
the
most
common
aspects
of
success
is
learning
how
to
deal
with
failure
despite
many
successful
people
having
to
face
failure
they
were
able
to
learn
from
it
and
turn
it
into
an
opportunity
for
growth
it
s
not
easy
to
deal
with
failure
especially
when
you
have
high
expectations
when
someone
is
afraid
of
failure
the
best
way
to
motivate
them
is
to
remind
them
that
failure
can
be
a
lesson
in
the
journey
and
that
it
should
n t
stop
them
from
trying
to
reach
their
goals
to
succeed
in
difficult
challenges
it
s
important
to
stay
positive
and
prepared
if
something
is
n t
working
you
can
try
something
different
and
be
open
to
exploring
different
opportunities
taking
a
proactive
attitude
and
reframing
failure
as
a
learning
experience
can
be
a
great
way
to
approach
any
difficult
challenge
personally
i
have
experienced
both
failure
and
success
in
different
situations
there
have
been
times
when
i
ve
been
close
to
giving
up
only
to
find
that
the
steps
i
took
to
change
my
perspective
ultimately
paid
off
taking
the
initiative
to
give
something
a
different
approach
and
keeping
a
positive
outlook
has
certainly
helped
me
better
navigate
my
own
experiences
with
failure
and
success
failure
has
been
described
as
the
stepping stone
to
success
it
is
an
integral
part
of
life
that
can
teach
us
great
lessons
without
failure
people
lose
the
motivation
to
make
the
necessary
changes
in
order
to
achieve
success
my
own
experience
is
a
testament
to
this
i
failed
my
first
attempt
at
university
but
this
only
motivated
me
to
work
harder
and
eventually
i
graduated
with
honors
moreover
many
successful
historical
figures
have
gone
through
significant
amounts
of
failure
before
achieving
greatness
for
instance
failed
at
school
yet
he
is
now
one
of
the
most
well known
scientists
in
the
world
was
formerly
fired
from
a
job
due
to
her
race
yet
she
went
on
to
become

is
an
essential
part
of
robotics
that
allows
for
the
movement
and
actions
of
robots
to
be

it
involves
programming
the
robot
to
move
how
the
user
intends
such
as
lifting
an
arm
turning
its
head
and
more
in
order
to

accuracy
coding
must
be
detailed
and
precise
teams
of
people
can
collaborate
to
build
robots
with
each
team
member
playing
an
important
role
for

for
young
teenagers
to
dream
of
a
career
and
make
the
decision
to
pursue
a
specific
career
path
in
their
teenage
years
while
there
are
some
advantages
to
deciding
on
a
career
at
an
early
age
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
that
should
be
considered
the
primary
advantage
of
young
teenagers
choosing
to
pursue
a
career
early
is
that
it
can
give
them
a
head
start
on
their
desired
career
by
starting
earlier
teens
can
gain
more
experience
explore
available
options
and
earn
qualifications
that

teens
who
pursue
this
approach
are
also
likely
to
have
a
greater
clarity
regarding
their
career
choices
when
they
become
adults
however
there
are
some
important
disadvantages
to
young
teenagers
making
the
decision
to
pursue
a
specific
career
one
of
the
primary
drawbacks
is
that
although
teenagers
may
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
they
want
to
do
they
may
not
take
into
account
any
personal
and
professional
changes
that
may
occur
as
they
enter
adulthood
additionally
teens
can
often
become
so
focused
on
one
career
that
they
miss
out
on
various
other
opportunities
especially
if
the
chosen
career
path
doesn
t
work
out
in
conclusion
while

a
significant
advantage
there

potential
risks
in

this
decision
too
early
it
is
important
for
teens
to
consider
their
options
carefully
and
think
about
the
potential
upsides
and
downsides
before
committing
to
a
specific
career
path
in
this
day
and
age
it
is
important
to
take
the
time
to
carefully
consider
one
s
own
character
traits
and
the
implications
that
they
can
have
people
make
snap
judgments
based
solely
on
the
way
somebody
interacts
with
others
or
what
they
re
wearing
on
any
given
day
for
example
if
someone
is
wearing
bright
colors
and
interacting
boisterously
they
may
be
categorized
as
irresponsible
on
the
other
hand
someone
in
a
more
toned down
ensemble
and
keeping
to
themselves
may
be
perceived
as
introverted
or
shy
it
is
important
to
consider
that
these
assumptions
are
not
always
accurate
and
that
each
person
s
character
is
unique
to
them
having
a
good
character
is
a
term
often
used
to
describe
those
with
admirable
traits
such
as
being
honest
generous
and
respectful
it
s
important
to
remember
that
these
characteristics
are
skills
and
a
person
must
actively
work
on
honing
their
character
in
order
to
become
a
better
person
acquiring
these
skills
can
help
minimize
conflict
or
difficult
social
interactions
and
can
make
living
a
happy
and
successful
life
much
easier
it
should
be
noted
that
having
a
good
character
is
not
only
beneficial
for
the
individual
but
also
those
around
them
friends
and
family
can
be
more
confident
in
the
trustworthiness
of
the
person
and
colleagues
can
potentially
become
more
productive
as
a
direct
result
it
is
for
these
reasons
why
having
a
good
character
is
essential
in
everyday
life
in
order
to
ensure
that
each
person
is
in
their
best
possible
state
of
mind
it
is
important
to
take
the
time
and
effort
to
work
on
the
self
and
improve
their
character
s
statement
that
success
is
marked
by
failure
is
an
important
reminder
that
failure
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
and
a
necessary
component
of
success
when
striving
for
our
goals
failure
should
be
seen
as
an
opportunity
for
learning
and
growth
it
allows
us
to
make
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
helping
us
to
refine
our
skills
and
better
our
chances
of
achieving
our
goals
in
life
when
faced
with
problem solving
failure
can
also
teach
us
to
look
at
things
from
different
perspectives
instead
of
becoming
discouraged
by
mistakes
we
can
use
our
failures
to
fuel
our
motivation
and
put
us
on
the
path
to
success
extending
the
school
day
is
a
controversial
issue
that
has
been
gaining
attention
in
recent
years
on
the
one
hand
it
can
provide
additional
time
for
teachers
to
cover
topics
in
more
depth
it
can
also
give
students
the
opportunity
to
explore
new
extracurricular
activities
on
the
other
hand
it
can
lead
to
issues
such
as
student
fatigue
and
an
increased
workload
for
students
and
teachers
proponents
of
extending
the
school
day
argue
that
the
extra
time
provided
can
help
students
get
tutoring
or
extra
help
from
teachers
if
needed
it
can
also
allow
schools
to
introduce
enrichment
activities
such
as
field
trips
robotics
music
and
art
with
more
instructional
time
available
students
can
explore
more
in depth
subject
matter
and
may
even
get
the
chance
to
explore
topics
that
are
often
omitted
from
the
standard
curriculum
opponents
however
express
concern
that
extending
the
school
day
would
lead
to
increased
student
fatigue
with
the
current
school
day
already
being
long
any
additional
time
can
be
taxing
on
students
energy
levels
and
school
performance
these
students
may
end
up
feeling
exhausted
and
demotivated
which
could
lead
to
a
decrease
in
their
academic
performance
it
could
also
lead
to
mental
health
concerns
if
students
do
n t
have
adequate
rest
and
leisure
time
it
is
important
to
remember
that
extending
the
school
day
has
many
advantages
and
disadvantages
ultimately
the
decision
to
extend
the
school
day
should
take
into
account
the
unique
requirements
and
needs
of
each
school
community
educators
and
parents
should
carefully
consider
all
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
a
decision
on
this
issue
the
debate
surrounding
the
amount
of
summer
vacation
and
winter
break
for
students
is
a
longstanding
one
there
are
numerous
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
changing
this
amount
of
time
off
on
the
one
hand
a
longer
break
could
be
beneficial
to
students
as
it
would
provide
them
with
more
time
to
recuperate
from
the
rigors
of
the
school
year
and
take
part
in
activities
that
promote
growth
and
development
on
the
other
hand
a
shorter
break
could
enable
students
to
remain
on
track
academically
and
allow
them
to
make
the
most
of
their
time
off
the
opinions
of
students
on
the
proposed
changes
to
vacation
time
vary
greatly
some
feel
that
a
longer
break
would
give
them
more
time
to
relax
and
focus
on
those
activities
that
promote
physical
mental
and
social
growth
argue
that
a
shorter
break
would
allow
them
to
stay
on
top
of
their
studies
and
capture
the
momentum
they
ve
established
throughout
the
year
in
conclusion
it
is
difficult
to
reach
a
definite
position
on
the
issue
of
changing
the
amount
of
vacation
time
for
students
each
student
may
have
different
opinions
on
the
matter
making
it
important
to
consider
each
individual
opinion
before
making
a
decision
for
the
entire
student
body

failure
can
be
a
formidable
opponent
but
it
is
also
an
opportunity
to
reset
and
begin
anew
through
the
lens
of
self motivation
there
is
no
greater
tool
to
learn
from
failure
and
turn
it
into
a
catalyst
for
success
i
know
this
from
personal
experience
growing
up
i
was
filled
with
doubt
and
mistrust
of
my
abilities
after
a
few
failed
attempts
at
pursuing
a
passion
i
felt
disconnected
and
unsure
of
my
place
in
the
world
it
was
n t
until
i
began
to
believe
in
my
own
strengths
and
refused
to
let
failure
define
me
that
i
felt
empowered
to
continue
on
i
now
strive
for
success
in
everything
i
do
but
only
after
having
embraced
failure
and
its
importance
in
helping
me
become
the
person
i
am
today
living
a
life
of
meaning
and
fulfillment
means
learning
from
our
failures
and
embracing
every
experience
with
enthusiasm
after
some
reflection
on
my
own
life
i
have
come
to
agree
with
s
quote
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
i
discovered
the
importance
of
this
quote
when
i
was
applying
for
a
job
after
graduating
college
despite
learning
important
skills
in
the
university
and
preparing
extensively
i
was
rejected
from
the
position
i
wanted
the
most
although
i
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
rejection
the
actual
experience
was
incredibly
disheartening
however
instead
of
letting
it
dampen
my
spirits
i
chose
to
use
it
as
a
learning
opportunity
after
analyzing
what
went
wrong
in
the
application
process
i
applied
to
more
positions
and
kept
my
enthusiasm
up
by
challenging
myself
with
new
experiences
after
months
of
hard
work
and
dedication
i
finally
got
the
job
i
wanted
this
experience
taught
me
the
importance
of
keeping
enthusiasm
in
the
face
of
failure
even
when
i
fail
i
always
try
to
dust
myself
off
and
keep
pushing
forward
with
enthusiasm
and
an
open
mindset
i
have
also
learned
to
evaluate
why
i
failed
and
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
grow
from
this
experience
i
have
learned
to
never
settle
no
matter
how
many
times
i
fail
by
taking
heed
of
s
words
i
always
strive
to
keep
an
energized
outlook
on
the
future
and
use
failure
as
a
learning
opportunity
the
potential
introduction
of
a
rule
requiring
all
high
school
students
to
take
courses
during
the
summer
evenings
or
weekends
in
order
to
finish
school
faster
has
a
wide
range
of
implications
to
consider
for
immigrant
students
this
could
be
especially
challenging
due
to
cultural
financial
and
language
barriers
they
may
face
it
could
also
be
difficult
on
the
teachers
who
would
be
expected
to
teach
the
courses
on
top
of
their
current
workload
and
without
receiving
additional
compensation
furthermore
this
rule
could
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
free
time
of
all
students
taking
away
invaluable
time
they
would
otherwise
spend
engaging
in
hobbies
sports
educational
trips
and
socializing
with
their
family
and
friends
in
considering
the
potential
creation
of
such
a
rule
it
would
be
wise
for
decision makers
to
weigh
these
factors
carefully
performing
acts
of
kindness
is
a
great
way
to
bring
joy
and
comfort
to
those
around
us
i
recently
experienced
a
situation
that
showed
just
how
beneficial
these
kinds
of
acts
can
be
i
was
visiting
a
local
farm
with
a
friend
when
we
noticed
that
a
nearby
chicken
was
struggling
to
get
free
of
some
brambles
that
had
grown
over
its
coop
although
we
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
my
friend
decided
to
help
the
chicken
after
seeing
it
trapped
and
unable
to
escape
she
knelt
down
and
began
carefully
picking
away
the
brambles
from
the
chicken
s
enclosure
allowing
the
chicken
to
wiggle
free
as
she
was
doing
so
the
chicken
started
clucking
in
a
content
manner
it
was
a
strange
but
heartwarming
sight
seeing
this
act
of
kindness
touched
me
deeply
it
showed
me
that
one
random
act
of
kindness
can
make
a
difference
in
someone
else
s
life
even
if
it
s
something
as
small
as
freeing
a
chicken
from
some
brambles
by
performing
this
act
of
kindness
my
friend
had
made
a
difference
not
just
for
the
chicken
but
for
me
too
i
had
gotten
to
witness
an
act
of
kindness
that
had
made
both
of
us
feel
wonderful
from
this
experience
i
can
say
that
performing
even
just
one
act
of
kindness
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
people
involved
it
creates
a
shared
sense
of
joy
and
contentment
and
helps
demonstrate
the
importance
of
kindness
and
compassion
in
our
lives
in
addition
it
can
generally
inspire
people
to
do
more
acts
of
kindness
for
others
it
is
my
hope
that
more
people
take
the
opportunity
to
perform
random
acts
of
kindness
wherever
possible
doing
so
can
help
to
foster
a
more
generally
understanding
and
compassionate
society
additionally
it
is
a
great
way
to
give
something
back
to
the
community
and
make
the
world
a
better
place
even
the
smallest
acts
of
kindness
can
have
a
big
impact
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
hugely
beneficial
for
students
starting
early
helps
prepare
students
for
their
future
while
teaching
them
valuable
life
skills
such
as
budgeting
networking
and
prioritization
it
can
also
provide
students
with
the
direction
they
need
to
focus
their
studies
and
other
extracurricular
activities
on
a
subject
they
are
passionate
about
besides
the
practical
benefits
there
are
many
creative
strategies
to
express
oneself
through
a
career
for
example
students
can
leverage
their
course
of
study
to

individual
passions
and
talents
that
support
their
understanding
of
their
chosen
field
by
deciding
on
their
career
at
a
young
age
students
are
able
to
apply
and

the
use
of
the
creative
strategies
that
further
demonstrate
their
enthusiasm
knowledge
and
expertise
for
the
chosen
field
ultimately
by
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
students
get
a
head
start
on
their
professional
development
it
provides
students
with
the
opportunity
to
focus
and
align
their
educational
choices
and
creative
strategies
to
support
their
future
ambitions
for
these
reasons
all
students
should
start
to
choose
their
career
at
a
young
age
online
classes
present
a
unique
opportunity
for
students
to
learn
without
attending
a
traditional
school
setting
the
convenience
of
online
classes
is
twofold
on
the
one
hand
they
can
be
taken
from
anywhere
without
the
need
to
catch
a
bus
or
spend
time
commuting
plus
students
can
attend
class
when
they
are
sick
and
don
t
have
to
worry
about
being
marked
absent
or
behind
in
their
curriculum
on
the
other
hand
they
also
provide
flexible
schedules
where
students
can
start
their
day
at
a
later
time
than
a
traditional
school
day
making
it
easier
to
fit
around
the
other
commitments
in
their
lives
while
there
are
obvious
advantages
to
taking
online
classes
there
are
potential
drawbacks
as
well
for
example
constantly
looking
at
a
bright
computer
screen
for
long
duration
can
strain
eyes
and
the
risk
of
distractions
due
to
the
comfortable
environment
of
home
can
be
high
furthermore
the
lack
of
a
physical
classroom
with
peers
and
an
instructor
can
also
make
it
harder
to
stay
motivated
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
has
many
potential
benefits
students
are
able
to
take
courses
in
the
summer
and
in
evenings
to
reduce
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
school
this
can
also
be
a
way
to
save
money
on
tuition
or
other
fees
associated
with
college
in
addition
students
who
graduate
high
school
early
have
more
time
to
focus
on
a
job
or
internship
this
could
mean
gaining
skills
and
experience
to
prepare
them
for
college
or
earn
money
to
help
pay
for
college
tuition
on
the
other
hand
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
could
put
students
at
a
disadvantage
a
key
part
of
the
high
school
experience
is
learning
important
social
skills
which
may
be
difficult
to
learn
in
a
shorter
time
frame
while
taking
courses
in
the
summer
or
evenings
in
order
to
graduate
early
can
be
beneficial
it
is
also
possible
for
students
to
become
overwhelmed
with
too
much
academic
work
in
a
short
amount
of
time
ultimately
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
can
be
a
positive
experience
but
it
is
important
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
before
making
a
decision
taking
courses
in
the
summer
or
evenings
working
an
extra
year
to
save
money
for
college
and
the
opportunity
to
focus
on
skills
and
experience
all
make
graduating
high
school
early
a
viable
option
for
some
students
when
it
comes
to
the
challenges
associated
with
working
alone
common
difficulties
include
lack
of
motivation
isolation
distractions
and
difficulty
accessing
resources
to
combat
these
issues
it
is
often
useful
to
create
a
strict
daily
schedule
and
set
specific
goals
to
keep
yourself
motivated
and
on
task
if
you
are
working
away
from
an
office
or
other
group
setting
it
also
helps
to
use
organizational
tools
such
as
applications
or
digital
tools
to
keep
track
of
tasks
and
collaborate
with
colleagues
if
necessary
additionally
it
is
important
to
stay
mindful
of
your
mental
and
physical
wellbeing
by
taking
regular
breaks
and
finding
ways
to
socialize
such
as
scheduling
calls
with
peers
unlike
working
alone
working
in
a
group
affords
us
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
one
another
get
a
variety
of
perspectives
on
a
given
project
have
access
to
more
creative
resources
and
stay
energized
and
inspired
by
exchanging
ideas
additionally
because
collaborations
require
more
communication
you
will
likely
form
stronger
connections
with
your
peers
which
can
help
build
relationships
and
spark
creativity
down
the
line
in
terms
of
music
it
can
be
a
great
resource
for
creating
a
calm
and
productive
atmosphere
instrumental
music
in
particular
can
reduce
interference
from
sound based
distractions
while
also
providing
a
sense
of
motivation
and
flow
other
useful
resources
for
working
alone
include
virtual
tools
that
allow
you
to
collaborate
with
colleagues
online
training
sessions
that
allow
you
to
develop
new
skills
online
networking
events
to
socialize
with
colleagues
and
motivational
podcasts
that
can
help
keep
you
inspired
in
your
work
learning
may
have
its
advantages
for
those
who
are
unable
to
attend
physical
classes
due
to
challenging
family
or
work
commitments
however
it
is
important
to
consider
that
students
may
not
be
able
to
benefit
fully
from
this
style
of
learning
the
main
issue
is
that
this
environment
is
full
of
potential
distractions
students
may
be
easily
tempted
by
electronic
devices
or
the
company
of
their
parents
siblings
or
friends
this
means
that
much
of
their
attention
is
potentially
not
focused
on
school
work
which
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
their
progress
and
educational
attainment
another
concern
is
that
some
students
may
find
distance
learning
dull
and
struggle
to
concentrate
and
learn
on
their
own
without
the
support
of
their
teacher
the
individualised
guidance
needed
to
fully
understand
concepts
or
problems
might
be
lacking
this
can
lead
to
them
feeling
disengaged
with
their
education
and
reluctant
to
continue
to
learn
finally
due
to
the
lack
of
a
physical
break
in
a
technician
s
routine
fatigue
can
easily
impair
their
concentration
and
performance
without
physical
activity
regular
breaks
and
structure
students
may
feel
overwhelmed
or
exhausted
by
having
to
make
it
through
the
day
which
can
lead
to
issues
with
maintaining
mental
and
physical
health
in
conclusion
despite
some
advantages
distance
learning
does
not
necessarily
provide
an
ideal
environment
for
students
who
wish
to
focus
on
their
studies
the
potential
for
multiple
distractions
lack
of
teacher
guidance
and
added
stress
of
regular
study
on
their
own
can
create
difficulties
for
learners
who
are
looking
to
excel
in
their
chosen
field
dropping
out
of
school
can
be
a
difficult
decision
for
students
who
are
looking
to
enter
the
workforce
and
start
earning
money
right
away
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potentially
negative
long term
implications
of
this
choice
staying
in
school
and
taking
advantage
of
the
offer
to
finish
early
can
be
a
better
option
for
those
who
want
to
achieve
financial
security
in
the
future
while
dropping
out
of
school
reduces
the
workload
and
stress
of
academic
classes
it
may
also
mean
missing
out
on
important
skills
and
knowledge
that
can
be
gained
through
and
outside
the
class
for
those
who
choose
to
stay
and
finish
early
taking
classes
that
are
not
necessarily
required
for
graduation
can
be
beneficial
and
these
students
should
weigh
these
options
carefully
before
deciding
there
are
clear
benefits
to
taking
the
offer
to
finish
early
and
they
should
be
considered
carefully
when
thinking
about
looking
for
a
job
in
the
future
introduction
school
days
have
become
a
controversial
issue
as
of
late
while
some
argue
that
extending
school
days
would
have
educational
and
social
benefits
i
am
against
the
idea
of
adding
one
and
a
half
hour
to
school
days
this
essay
will
detail
four
main
reasons
why
this
should
not
be
implemented
we
are
already
in
school
for
hours
and
it
is
too
much
hours
is
already
a
long
time
to
spend
in
school
times
are
different
since
the
introduction
of
digital
devices
in
education
and
children
may
struggle
to
focus
on
tasks
and
activities
so
long
into
the
day
as
their
brains
tire
so
does
their
capacity
for
learning
we
do
n t
have
enough
time
for
personal
activities
having
a
longer
school
day
would
mean
less
free
time
in
the
afternoon
for
students
to
learn
valuable
activities
like
how
to
manage
their
finances
pursue
hobbies
cooking
time
with
family
and
much
more
too
much
homework
having
a
longer
school
day
means
more
homework
for
students
and
puts
greater
pressure
on
them
even
if
teachers
spread
out
assignments
and
give
manageable
homework
a
longer
school
day
will
result
in
massive
piles
of
assignments
appointments
are
missed
students
and
their
families
may
find
it
almost
impossible
to
juggle
appointments
such
as
counseling
medical
and
a
range
of
other
services
in
and
around
a
longer
school
day
such
appointments
are
crucial
and
an
impossibly
long
school
day
could
lead
to
missed
opportunities
for
numerous
students
in
conclusion
i
believe
the
idea
of
adding
another
one
and
a
half
hours
to
school
days
should
be
abandoned
in
favor
of
shorter
days
and
better
educational
methods
the
additional
time
taken
up
by
longer
school
days
is
unnecessary
and
could
lead
to
detrimental
consequences
for
both
students
and
teachers
with
the
increasing
use
of
technology
in
our
lives
many
of
us
are
becoming
increasingly
disconnected
from
our
physical
and
emotional
worlds
we
now
spend
our
days
staring
at
screens
tapping
away
on
devices
and
skimming
through
digital
content
rather
than
engaging
with
the
world
around
us
here
are
five
reasons
why
i
disagree
with
the
increased
use
of
technology
in
my
life
firstly
i
believe
it
s
important
to
keep
a
balance
between
technological
and
natural
elements
of
life
too
much
time
spent
with
screens
and
devices
will
lead
us
to
miss
out
on
important
connections
and
experiences
found
in
the
real
world
such
as
interactions
with
nature
conversations
with
our
peers
and
simply
the
joy
of
physical
play
outside
for
example
a
recent
outing
to
the
beach
with
family
has
highlighted
the
beauty
of
our
natural
environment
and
the
importance
of
connecting
with
the
physical
world
secondly
the
heavy
reliance
on
technology
can
be
detrimental
to
our
mental
health
health
researchers
now
suggest
heavy
use
of
technology
can
lead
to
a
range
of
mental
health
problems
such
as
depression
anxiety
and
attention
deficit hyperactivity
disorder
by
shutting
out
reality
and
replacing
it
with
the
digital
one
we
neglect
our
need
for
meaningful
human
interaction
and
emotional
attachment
thirdly
technology
can
be
a
huge
distraction
from
tasks
we
need
to
complete
such
as
and
snapchat
have
the
potential
to
keep
us
on
our
devices
for
hours
without
us
even
realising
it
we
can
lose
precious
time
that
could
be
spent
on
more
important
tasks
or
even
relaxation
activities
such
as
going
for
a
walk
reading
a
book
or
listening
to
music
technology
can
make
us
lazy
instead
of
walking
to
the
local
store
or
post
office
we
can
just
order
what
we
need
online
we
no
longer
have
to
leave
our
homes
for
entertainment
we
can
just
access
that
online
instead
eventually
this
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
physical
fitness
leading
to
further
health
issues
finally
misuse
of
technology
could
potentially
lead
to
cybercrime
or
other
forms
of
digital
fraud
we
can
fall
into
the
trap
of
clicking
on
malicious
links
or
downloading
software
from
false
sources
leaving
our
personal
information
exposed
and
vulnerable
it
is
clear
why
i
disagree
with
the
increased
use
of
technology
in
my
life
in
order
to
live
a
balanced
and
fulfilling
life
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
amount
of
time
we
spend
interacting
with
technology
and
taking
it
away
from
other
activities
the
implementation
of
a
healthier
cafeteria
menu
could
be
hugely
beneficial
for
students
eating
right
is
a
fundamental
part
of
staying
healthy
and
by
having
better
options
in
the
cafeteria
students
can
make
better
food
choices
that
align
with
their
physical
and
mental
well being
not
only
that
having
access
to
a
balanced
and
nutritious
school
lunch
could
lead
to
improved
academic
performance
due
to
the
increased
energy
and
mental
focus
associated
with
a
healthier
diet
moreover
real life
examples
demonstrate
the
positive
outcomes
of
transitioning
to
a
healthier
cafeteria
menu
such
as
reduced
rates
of
obesity
and
greater
physical
fitness
among
students
in
summary
schools
should
strive
to
maintain
a
cafeteria
menu
that
focuses
on
providing
a
variety
of
nutritious
and
delicious
meal
options
for
students
and
a
transition
from
a
junk
food
menu
to
a
healthier
one
is
an
excellent
way
to
start
trips
have
become
an
integral
part
of
the
educational
experience
and
the
impact
they
can
have
on
students
mental
and
physical
well being
is
becoming
more
evident
spending
too
much
time
in
one
location
can
increase
levels
of
stress
and
fatigue
in
both
students
and
teachers
taking
regular
breaks
outside
or
in
new
locations
can
provide
beneficial
physical
and
psychological
effects
on
students
these
breaks
can
help
break
up
the
monotony
of
staying
in
the
same
educational
environment
and
can
also
provide
an
opportunity
for
students
to
explore
new
and
interesting
places
when
comparing
educational
experiences
had
within
the
school
building
and
those
done
on
field
trips
it
can
be
argued
that
field
trips
offer
the
most
beneficial
opportunities
trips
offer
students
the
chance
to
experience
educational
activities
outside
the
classroom
while
discovering
new
places
and
surroundings
this
can
also
help
foster
strong
and
lasting
relationships
between
students
and
their
surroundings
therefore
it
is
clear
that
field
trips
are
an
incredibly
valuable
opportunity
for
middle
school
aged
children
and
their
continued
inclusion
in
school
curriculum
is
beneficial
teaching
math
to
elementary
school
students
is
an
invaluable
task
that
fosters
development
of
essential
skills
provides
children
with
an
opportunity
to
develop
logical
reasoning
problem solving
and
critical
thinking
skills
it
also
helps
students
understand
the
world
around
them
better
as
math
applies
to
many
aspects
of
life
such
as
counting
money
and
measuring
distances
introduces
many
key
concepts
in
a
hands on
concrete
way
that
lays
the
foundation
for
more
advanced
learning
as
children
become
more
confident
working
with
numbers
they
begin
to
build
confidence
in
other
areas
of
life
too
this
can
help
them
excel
in
more
difficult
academics
such
as
algebra
and
calculus
which
are
increasingly
important
later
in
life
ultimately
teaching
math
to
young
learners
is
essential
to
hone
their
problem solving
and
logical
reasoning
skills
as
well
as
set
them
up
for
success
in
the
future
with
the
recent
push
to
focus
more
on
core
education
the
addition
of
electives
such
as
music
art
and
drama
classes
in
high
school
could
be
a
great
way
to
introduce
students
to
a
varied
curriculum
while
these
classes
often
have
minimal
instructional
value
in
terms
of
getting
good
grades
they
still
offer
plenty
of
potential
benefits
for
students
by
offering
these
classes
students
have
the
opportunity
to
explore
their
creative
sides
develop
critical
thinking
skills
learn
how
to
work
with
others
and
gain
an
appreciation
for
art
music
and
drama
on
the
downside
making
these
classes
electives
can
be
seen
as
creating
an
unfair
advantage
for
students
who
can
afford
to
spend
more
time
or
money
on
them
for
example
if
a
student
is
from
a
wealthy
family
they
may
be
able
to
purchase
expensive
instruments
or
pay
for
private
art
classes
while
a
student
from
a
less
privileged
background
may
not
be
able
to
access
the
same
opportunities
furthermore
if
other
courses
like
math
and
science
are
not
seen
as
important
due
to
the
presence
of
these
electives
then
students
may
be
less
inclined
to
focus
on
pursuing
a
fulfilling
successful
career
path
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
making
music
art
and
drama
classes
electives
at
high
school
should
be
considered
carefully
in
order
to
make
the
right
decision
for
all
students
conserving
energy
is
one
of
the
most
important
elements
of
sustainability
and
resource
conservation
it
is
important
to
conserve
energy
both
financially
and
ecologically
environmentally friendly
energy
conservation
can
lead
to
economic
and
environmental
benefits
such
as
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
saving
money
on
energy
bills
additionally
conserving
energy
can
help
to
reduce
reliance
on
natural
resources
like
paper
such
as
in
an
academic
setting
teachers
can
encourage
students
to
move
away
from
traditional
paper based
learning
activities
and
use
digital
applications
instead
there
are
also
many
ways
individuals
can
help
conserve
energy
in
everyday
life
such
as
turning
off
lights
when
leaving
a
room
washing
clothes
in
cold
water
buying
products
with
the
label
and
recycling
by
conserving
energy
we
can
reduce
our
carbon
footprint
help
protect
the
environment
and
make
significant
cost
savings

current
tactical
approach
that
combines
team
spirit
and
defensive
prowess
the
team
has
achieved
great
success
in
recent
years
to
continue
achieving
success
the
players
must
continually
practice
various
drills
such
as
passing
shooting
and
ball
control
to
hone
their
individual
soccer
skills
furthermore
the
team
must
practice
and
perfect
different
team
formations
and
strategies
in
order
to
effectively
use
their
talents
in
tournament
play
friendly
games
can
be
a
valuable
asset
to
improve
the
skills
and
strategies
of
the
team
and
when
combined
with
rigorous
practice
can
lead
to
a
successful
competitive
season
with
enough
preparation
the
team
can
then
compete
in
championships
for
the
honor
of
winning
trophies
the
ultimate
goal
for
the
team
is
to
qualify
for
the
championship
and
play
in
leagues
in
order
to
become
eligible
for
more
prestigious
trophies
for
students
considering
graduating
high
school
in
less
than
the
traditional
four
year
time
frame
there
are
several
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
that
choice
to
consider
the
most
significant
advantage
is
cost
savings
students
can
save
up
to
half
a
year
s
tuition
by
graduating
in
three
years
compared
to
four
graduating
early
also
allows
for
increased
college
course
work
in
the
remaining
time
giving
students
the
opportunity
to
impress
college
admissions
offices
on
the
other
hand
although
graduating
early
will
help
save
money
students
who
choose
this
route
may
not
have
had
the
opportunity
to
take
as
many
classes
as
those
who
completed
the
traditional
four
years
when
it
comes
to
college
preparedness
this
is
an
important
factor
to
consider
additionally
graduating
in
three
years
may
leave
students
feeling
as
though
they
are
missing
out
on
a
major
part
of
their
high
school
experience
in
the
form
of
sports
teams
clubs
and
other
activities
in
my
opinion
students
should
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
graduating
early
before
making
the
decision
to
do
so
graduating
early
can
be
beneficial
depending
on
the
individual
s
goals
and
needs
it
may
be
easier
to
get
ahead
in
college
preparedness
through
a
three
year
plan
while
maintaining
the
full
high
school
experience
and
taking
all
the
available
classes
may
be
the
best
fit
for
others
ultimately
the
decision
is
a
personal
one
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration
with
care
as
part
of
my
research
i
have
identified
several
benefits
of
eating
healthier
food
healthy
foods
is
essential
for
maintaining
an
optimal
level
of
energy
reducing
the
risk
of
serious
illness
and
improving
overall
health
changes
to
the
school
s
lunch
menu
can
play
a
major
role
in
encouraging
students
to
make
healthier
choices
by
focusing
on
providing
more
wholesome
options
such
as
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
lean
proteins
whole
grains
and
healthy
snacks
we
can
increase
the
number
of
healthy
options
on
the
menu
this
shift
in
focus
can
also
help
de emphasize
unhealthy
options
such
as
processed
snacks
sugary
drinks
and
unhealthy
condiments
i
would
like
to
present
this
information
to
the
school
principal
to
discuss
the
need
for
an
improved
lunch
menu
with
healthier
options
that
are
designed
to
meet
the
dietary
needs
of
students
making
your
own
decisions
is
essential
for
a
healthy
and
prosperous
life
when
we
have
the
freedom
and
autonomy
to
make
decisions
we
gain
a
sense
of
self ownership
and
control
over
our
destiny
by
having
the
ability
to
choose
our
own
path
we
can
be
empowered
to
seek
out
the
best
opportunities
available
to
us
and
create
a
future
that
is
full
of
possibility
take
marriage
as
an
example
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
decisions
we
make
in
life
and
one
that
many
of
us
delegate
to
others
when
we
make
our
own
decisions
about
who
we
marry
or
even
if
we
don
t
marry
we
can
ensure
that
the
individual
we
select
is
a
genuine
partner
on
whom
we
can
depend
in
addition
we
can
evaluate
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
relationship
and
consider
our
own
needs
and
goals
is
another
key
decision
that
should
be
made
of
your
own
accord
while
it
is
often
a
common
expectation
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
someone
else
such
as
our
parents
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
our
lives
are
our
own
and
that
if
we
want
to
pursue
something
different
then
we
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
making
our
own
decisions
on
relocation
opens
up
a
world
of
possibilities
allowing
us
to
explore
new
experiences
and
discover
what
brings
us
true
happiness
and
success
in
addition
the
importance
of
being
able
to
make
our
own
decisions
can
be
seen
in
our
capacity
to
recognize
the
good
and
the
bad
in
life
while
most
of
us
are
predisposed
to
stick
with
the
status
quo
including
ideas
and
beliefs
that
have
been
passed
down
to
us
from
previous
generations
it
is
only
when
we
make
our
own
decisions
that
we
are
able
to
critically
evaluate
any
potential
risks
or
rewards
associated
with
our
decisions
this
customizing
of
our
mental
framework
leads
to
greater
self awareness
and
enables
us
to
make
informed
decisions
overall
making
your
own
decisions
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
an
enriching
and
fulfilling
life
and
when
we
take
control
of
our
destiny
we
can
shape
our
lives
to
our
satisfaction

into
the

in
s
quote
i
m
a
great
believer
in
luck
and
i
find
the
harder
i
work
the
more
i
have
of
it
speaks
to
the
idea
that
hard
work
can
lead
to
success
this
has
been
exemplified
by
these
individuals
and
is
evidence
that
setting
goals
and
working
diligently
to
achieve
them
can
lead
to
a
successful
outcome
enthusiasm
is
one
of
the
most
important
qualities
for
achieving
success
it
is
an
essential
mindset
to
have
when
tackling
challenging
tasks
and
it
can
be
the
key
to
reaching
our
goals
to
illustrate
this
point
we
can
look
at
the
example
of
and
my
mother
known
for
his
hard working
attitude
and
enthusiasm
on
the
football
pitch
has
gone
on
to
become
one
of
the
most
decorated
footballers
of
all
time
his
enthusiasm
for
his
sport
has
been
instrumental
in
his
development
into
one
of
the
greatest
players
of
all
time
his
enthusiasm
also
keeps
him
motivated
to
keep
performing
at
a
high
level
something
that
clearly
shows
in
his
game
my
mother
is
another
example
of
someone
who
has
seen
success
due
to
her
enthusiasm
she
went
from
being
unemployed
to
running
a
successful
catering
business
she
was
passionate
about
creating
a
business
and
her
enthusiasm
for
the
work
kept
her
motivated
to
pursue
her
dreams
her
enthusiasm
was
crucial
in
helping
her
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
and
without
it
she
might
not
have
achieved
the
success
she
enjoys
today
in
conclusion
enthusiasm
is
essential
for
success
when
pursuing
our
dreams
we
must
maintain
an
enthusiastic
and
hard working
attitude
examples
such
as
and
my
mother
illustrate
how
this
attitude
can
lead
to
great
success
in
recent
years
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
with
many
of
us
constantly
connected
to
the
online
world
through
our
phones
tablets
and
laptops
this
increased
access
to
technology
has
brought
with
it
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
the
social
dynamic
especially
for
the
younger
generations
in
terms
of
the
classroom
being
surrounded
by
digital
screens
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
engage
in
face to face
communication
technology
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
interact
both
in
the
physical
space
of
the
classroom
as
well
as
with
one
another
on
an
emotional
level
this
can
manifest
itself
in
disruptive
behavior
such
as
students
talking
over
one
another
in
conversations
or
physical
aggression
moreover
the
ease
of
access
to
the
internet
can
also
make
individuals
particularly
vulnerable
to
online
bullying
one
example
is
that
of
a
young
student
who
was
cyber bullied
by
her
peers
for
her
choice
of
clothing
despite
trying
to
ignore
the
comments
out
of
fear
she
became
increasingly
isolated
as
her
peers
began
to
ostracize
her
the
prevalence
of
online
trolling
and
fake
news
can
also
add
to
the
mental
stress
and
social
burden
of
those
who
use
the
internet
news
can
misinform
and
mislead
people
which
can
lead
to
social
misunderstandings
and
false
impressions
trolling
usually
involves
malicious
remarks
and
hurtful
language
which
can
make
individuals
of
any
age
feel
insecure
given
the
sheer
complexity
of
the
issue
it
is
important
to
explore
different
methods
to
reduce
the
detrimental
impact
of
technology
on
students
social
skills
strategies
such
as
providing
students
with
access
to
mental
health
services
emphasizing
the
importance
of
in person
interaction
and
encouraging
digital
literacy
can
help
to
some
extent
ultimately
it
is
important
for
teachers
and
parents
to
strive
for
a
balance
between
technological
use
in
the
classroom
and
fostering
physical
interaction
one
example
of
an
individual
who
has
risen
from
hardship
and
become
successful
in
athletics
is
boxer
had
humble
beginnings
growing
up
in
a
segregated
despite
many
obstacles
achieved
fame
and
success
through
his
tremendous
boxing
skills
and
powerful
personality
his
hard
work
dedication
and
resilience
have
been
inspiring
to
generations
of
people
from
all
walks
of
life
he
made
sure
to
use
his
position
of
influence
to
open
up
discussion
about
civil
rights
and
bring
attention
to
pressing
problems
in
the
and
the
world
his
quest
for
justice
and
determination
to
stay
true
to
who
he
was
has
encouraged
and
challenged
other
athletes
and
regular
citizens
alike
to
fight
for
what
they
believe
in
and
never
give
up
on
their
dreams
his
life
and
legacy
still
serves
as
a
great
source
of
inspiration
to
many
and
his
success
has
been
one
of
the
greatest
triumphs
of
human
spirit
and
resilience
poverty
depression
relationships
need
and
peer
pressure
are
all
external
factors
that
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
someone
s
behavior
over
time
many
people
turn
to
vices
in
an
effort
to
escape
from
a
difficult
situation
for
example
children
born
into
poverty
may
lose
hope
in
life
resulting
in
destructive
behavioral
trends
such
as
addiction
or
criminal
activities
similarly
depressed
individuals
may
use
drugs
or
alcohol
as
a
means
of
coping
with
their
condition
relationships
can
also
impact
a
person
s
behavior
many
people
in
abusive
relationships
may
suffer
from
low
self esteem
leading
to
compromised
decision making
or
reckless
and
dangerous
actions
pressure
can
also
be
a
powerful
influence
particularly
among
young
people
teens
often
feel
obligated
to
conform
to
their
peers
behaviors
even
if
those
behaviors
are
dangerous
or
wrong
people
are
strongly
affected
by
the
external
forces
around
them
while
the
aforementioned
factors
can
lead
to
negative
behavior
it
is
important
to
remember
that
no
one
is
predestined
to
a
life
of
destruction
it
is
never
too
late
to
take
control
of
one
s
behavior
and
seek
out
positive
influences
that
will
lead
to
a
more
productive
life
when
applying
for
a
new
job
it
is
important
to
do
all
of
your
research
ahead
of
time
before
submitting
my
application
i
make
sure
to
study
the
job
requirements
and
responsibilities
identify
my
strengths
that
make
me
a
strong
candidate
compile
a
list
of
my
prior
work
experience
and
note
any
language
ability
i
then
draft
a
letter
to
employers
outlining
my
qualifications
and
suitability
for
the
position
ensuring
to
proofread
and
revise
it
for
any

valuing
yourself
is
essential
to
living
a
healthy
and
meaningful
life
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
every
person
deserves
to
be
respected
and
treated
with
kindness
and
consideration
having
someone
to
look
up
to
as
an
example
can
be
empowering
providing
inspiration
to
help
us
reach
our
full
potential
and
strive
for
greatness
when
things
don
t
go
as
expected
it
s
important
to
practice
self compassion
instead
of
beating
yourself
up
or
believing
you
are
not
good
enough
it
s
best
to
accept
that
sometimes
we
make
mistakes
and
learn
from
those
experiences
and
when
we
are
feeling
overwhelmed
or
unsure
of
what
to
do
asking
for
help
is
a
sign
of
strength
not
weakness
doing
so
can
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
giving
us
access
to
resources
and
knowledge
that
can
help
us
in
times
of
need
at
the
end
of
the
day
valuing
yourself
and
having
someone
to
look
up
to
is
an
important
part
of
living
a
fulfilling
life
forget
your
worth
and
remember
that
there
is
always
support
available
should
you
need
it
setting
a
goal
for
myself
was
an
intimidating
thought
as
i
was
unsure
how
i
would
be
able
to
achieve
such
a
goal
but
i
was
determined
to
prove
to
myself
that
i
could
do
anything
i
put
my
mind
to
even
if
it
was
something
outside
of
my
comfort
zone
i
decided
to
break
this
goal
down
into
smaller
more
manageable
tasks
challenging
myself
to
finish
each
one
to
the
best
of
my
ability
taking
initiative
and
self motivation
were
also
incredibly
important
in
order
to
get
things
done
i
learned
that
by
motivating
myself
and
helping
others
i
was
able
to
gain
confidence
and
build
relationships
with
those
around
me
by
understanding
that
i
have
the
strength
to
reach
my
goals
i
was
able
to
take
the
challenge
and
ultimately
succeed
recent
research
has
shown
that
older
students
in
school
can
have
a
positive
influence
on
younger
students
for
example
by
providing
guidance
and
advice
the
older
student
can
help
lead
a
younger
student
through
difficult
subject
matter
or
give
them
encouragement
and
direction
when
it
comes
to
their
academic
work
additionally
there
has
been
evidence
that
older
students
can
act
as
mentors
for
younger
students
in
areas
where
the
older
students
have
struggled
themselves
this
allows
the
younger
students
to
relate
to
the
situations
better
trust
the
advice
given
and
be
more
willing
to
try
the
tasks
themselves
furthermore
the
older
student
s
presence
in
helping
with
service
hours
can
give
younger
students
a
sense
of
purpose
with
the
sense
of
responsibility
they
get
from
helping
young
students
may
become
more
invested
in
their
school
and
academic
work
all
in
all
having
older
students
provide
guidance
and
leadership
to
younger
students
in
a
school
setting
can
have
a
number
of
positive
effects
changes
to
the
policy
that
requires
students
to
have
an
or
grade
to
participate
in
sports
would
have
a
variety
of
implications
the
most
obvious
implication
would
be
that
students
with
lower
grades
would
be
allowed
to
participate
in
sports
which
could
ultimately
result
in
an
increase
in
student
participation
however
this
could
have
both
positive
and
negative
side
effects
on
the
positive
side
allowing
lower performing
students
to
participate
in
sports
could
inspire
them
to
strive
for
better
grades
in
order
to
stay
in
the
sport
on
the
other
hand
allowing
lower performing
students
to
participate
could
make
them
less
inclined
to
put
in
the
extra
effort
necessary
to
get
an
or
grade
or
to
attend
classes
as
they
may
come
to
rely
on
sports
as
their
primary
source
of
motivation
further
this
could
create
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
more
successful
students
who
may
have
chosen
to
participate
in
sports
as
a
reward
for
their
hard
work
would
become
discouraged
and
potentially
less
inclined
to
maintain
their
high
grades
consequently
all
aspects
of
student
effort
grades
and
behavior
should
be
carefully
considered
before
instituting
changes
to
this
policy
research
shows
that
recognizing
a
student
s
efforts
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
their
self esteem
and
self confidence
studies
have
revealed
that
teacher
recognition
can
motivate
students
to
challenge
themselves
and
work
hard
to
reach
their
goals
some
people
believe
that
teachers
should
only
give
recognition
for
work
that
meets
or
exceeds
expectations
while
others
argue
that
recognition
should
still
be
given
for
effort
even
when
the
results
achieved
are
not
up
to
expected
standards
for
example
a
teacher
might
recognize
a
student
with
a
try
again
sticker
to
show
the
student
s
effort
was
appreciated
even
though
their
work
was
n t
quite
successful
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
teacher
to
decide
when
and
based
on
what
criteria
recognition
should
be
given
although
studies
have
found
that
recognition
of
any
kind
is
beneficial
famously
said
that
success
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
indeed
failure
is
an
integral
part
of
the
pursuit
of
success
and
understanding
why
is
essential
to
maximizing
your
potential
not
many
people
are
a
failure
of
their
success
because
with
the
right
approach
failure
can
be
used
to
inform
our
decisions
and
propel
us
to
heights
we
would
never
have
achieved
without
it
the
first
example
of
why
not
many
people
are
a
failure
of
their
success
is
perseverance
the
individuals
who
refuse
to
give
up
in
the
face
of
adversity
are
the
ones
who
can
achieve
great
things
failed
more
than
times
in
his
pursuit
of
the
right
combination
of
materials
to
make
a
reliable
and
durable
light
bulb
yet
he
kept
trying
until
he
achieved
his
goal
his
ability
to
persevere
through
failure
was
the
key
to
success
in
the
end
the
second
example
of
why
not
many
people
are
a
failure
of
their
success
is
resilience
those
who
can
stay
focused
when
under
pressure
avoid
giving
up
and
keep
their
vision
alive
will
eventually
be
rewarded
for
example
when
was
fired
from
in
he
had
to
start
over
from
scratch
after
all
the
failure
and
setbacks
he
eventually
returned
to
build
one
of
the
most
successful
companies
in
the
world
many
people
are
also
inspired
by
what
they
are
going
and
using
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
can
be
especially
empowering
every
time
we
fail
we
get
a
chance
to
re evaluate
and
adjust
our
strategies
develop
new
skills
and
become
more
knowledgeable
and
determined
for
instance
after
was
fired
from
her
television
job
at
the
age
of
she
used
the
experience
to
her
advantage
she
was
determined
to
make
something
out
of
the
failure
and
learn
from
it
and
that
s
exactly
what
she
did
many
people
are
drawn
to
failure
because
it
provides
a
sense
of
achievement
facing
failure
is
not
easy
but
it
encourages
us
to
reach
beyond
our
comfort
zone
and
accomplish
something
extraordinary
consider
who
wanted
to
make
history
and
become
the
first
female
pilot
to
fly
solo
across
the
she
accepted
failure
as
part
of
the
process
and
used
her
courage
and
determination
to
make
her
dream
come
true
in
conclusion
failure
can
play
an
important
role
in
the
pursuit
of
success
if
we
choose
to
take
advantage
of
it
by
being
resilient
inspired
and
when
i
set
out
to
learn
a
new
language
i
knew
that
i
was
going
to
have
to
put
a
lot
of
effort
in
if
i
wanted
to
make
any
real
progress
i
threw
myself
into
studying
hard
and
it
was
extremely
rewarding
when
i
inevitably
saw
my
proficiency
increasing
however
i
noticed
that
my
efforts
were
more
effective
when
i
incorporated
gaming
into
my
language
learning
for
example
i
found
that
playing
video
games
in
the
language
i
was
learning
made
the
new
words
and
phrases
stick
more
effectively
in
my
mind
and
a
lot
quicker
than
when
i
was
just
using
traditional
methods
this
gave
me
confidence
in
my
progress
and
i
think
it
certainly
helped
me
to
achieve
the
level
i
wanted
to
reach
with
the
language
overall
i
found
that
incorporating
gaming
into
my
language
learning
regime
was
a
great
way
to
make
the
learning
process
more
enjoyable
while
also
helping
me
to
effectively
retain
the
material
the
storyteller
was
famous
for
conveying
profound
lessons
in
his
fables
one
piece
of
advice
that
often
repeated
was
to
not
waste
any
act
of
kindness
why
this
phrase
has
sustained
for
centuries
is
because
its
truth
is
timeless
small
act
of
kindness
can
quite
literally
help
change
the
world
as
a
result
we
should
never
turn
down
the
opportunity
to
do
something
good
for
someone
else
no
matter
how
small
it
may
be
for
example
a
simple
gesture
such
as
holding
the
door
for
someone
or
giving
up
your
seat
on
the
train
may
seem
insignificant
but
it
could
make
a
significant
impact
on
the
other
person
it
may
be
the
only
act
of
kindness
that
they
receive
that
day
and
they
may
think
about
it
long
after
it
has
passed
similarly
a
kind
word
of
encouragement
given
to
someone
during
a
tough
time
can
do
wonders
it
can
show
them
that
they
are
not
alone
and
that
somebody
is
there
to
support
them
overall
s
words
of
wisdom
carry
a
deep
meaning
and
remind
us
of
how
even
the
smallest
of
kindnesses
can
have
a
meaningful
impact
when
we
perform
acts
of
kindness
we
spread
happiness
not
only
to
others
but
to
ourselves
therefore
it
is
important
to
respect
and
practice
the
storyteller
s
advice
to
not
waste
any
act
of
kindness
my
chosen
research
topic
for
the
upcoming
science
fair
is
the
effects
of
global
warming
on
sea
level
by
studying
sea
level
change
over
the
past
decade
we
can
gain
insight
on
how
rapid
climate
change
is
impacting
the
planet
this
project
could
demonstrate
the
physical
effects
of
global
warming
in
real
life
while
also
providing
useful
information
without
being
overly
detailed
with
this
project
participants
can
also
learn
how
changes
in
the
climate
can
have
major
implications
on
the
environment
is
a
rapidly
changing
destination
that
offers
a
variety
of
socioeconomic
opportunities
for
immigrants
from
all
walks
of
life
the
city
boasts
a
strong
job
market
competitive
educational
institutions
and
a
supportive
government
leadership
everyday
resources
and
services
are
welcome
additions
that
often
make
it
easier
for
citizens
and
immigrants
to
manage
daily
needs
and
activities
the
culture
and
society
in
differ
from
those
of
states
in
several
ways
language
barriers
economic
developments
and
school
systems
are
all
examples
of
distinguishing
characteristics
despite
these
unique
differences
visitors
can
often
find
similar
recreational
activities
that
bring
together
old
and
new
cultures
alike
as
an
immigrant
i
am
able
to
relate
to
the
difficult
journey
of
leaving
one
s
home
in
pursuit
of
a
better
life
the
experiences
of
being
an
immigrant
can
be
both
challenging
and
rewarding
i
have
encountered
both
opportunities
and
obstacles
but
ultimately
am
grateful
for
the
growth
and
progress
overall
my
experience
living
in
has
been
a
positive
one
making
a
strong
first
impression
is
incredibly
important
in
life
it
can
set
the
tone
for
how
people
perceive
you
even
influencing
how
you
are
treated
later
on
this
is
particularly
true
of
situations
such
as
job
interviews
college
admissions
and
meeting
people
in
social
settings
put
simply
if
you
make
a
good
first
impression
it
is
easier
to
make
relationships
get
hired
and
succeed
however
making
a
good
first
impression
is
not
always
easy
as
it
relies
heavily
upon
the
beholder
s
subjective
assessment
unfortunately
this
means
it
can
be
difficult
to
change
a
first
impression
once
it
has
been
established
for
example
if
you
come
off
as
shy
or
uninterested
during
an
interview
the
hiring
manager
may
decide
that
the
person
they
re
interviewing
is
not
the
right
fit
for
the
job
moreover
if
you
do
get
the
job
there
may
always
be
an
underlying
impression
of
you
as
being
unenthusiastic
making
it
harder
to
climb
the
ladder
at
the
company
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
to
make
a
strong
first
impression
as
it
can
make
or
break
your
opportunities
in
life
unfortunately
it
can
be
difficult
to
recover
from
a
bad
one
the
best
way
to
ensure
a
successful
first
impression
in
any
situation
is
to
be
prepared
engage
actively
with
the
other
party
and
come
off
as
confident
and
genuinely
interested
in
the
situation
in
his
famous
quote
says
that
is
to
and
of
capital
is
only
the
fruit
of
labor
and
could
never
have
existed
if
labor
had
not
first
existed
is
the
of
and
deserves
much
the
higher
consideration
through
this
quote
emphasizes
the
importance
of
hard
work
and
communicates
the
idea
that
being
idle
is
not
a
desirable
quality
this
idea
can
be
applied
to
various
practical
scenarios
for
example
in
the
workplace
employees
who
are
idle
will
not
produce
desirable
results
so
it
is
important
that
they
stay
engaged
in
their
work
in
addition
in
a
student
s
academic
journey
being
idle
will
prevent
them
from
achieving
their
educational
goals
so
it
is
important
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
ultimately
s
quote
holds
true
labor
is
essential
and
being
idle
will
prove
to
be
ineffective
in
practical
scenarios
learning
in
a
classroom
setting
and
in
a
home
setting
both
have
distinct
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
a
classroom
setting
students
have
the
opportunity
to
directly
interact
with
teachers
and
other
students
which
can
foster
collaboration
and
discussion
and
help
deepen
one
s
understanding
of
the
material
on
the
other
hand
there
can
often
be
distractions
in
the
classroom
such
as
other
students
talking
or
texts
and
emails
buzzing
that
can
disrupt
one
s
focus
in
contrast
learning
in
a
home
setting
can
be
incredibly
effective
as
there
is
usually
fewer
distractions
and
a
more
relaxed
environment
as
well
if
a
student
finds
they
are
struggling
with
a
topic
they
can
usually
take
more
time
to
go
back
over
it
without
feeling
rushed
or
put
on
the
spot
however
without
direct
feedback
from
a
teacher
or
other
students
some
learners
may
feel
too
isolated
or
lack
the
motivation
to
stay
on
track
no
matter
what
setting
it
takes
place
in
effective
learning
happens
when
one
takes
responsibility
for
their
own
learning
and
is
willing
and
motivated
to
make
the
most
of
any
environment
excerpt
a
program
that
pairs
older
and
younger
students
has
many
benefits
that
can
positively
impact
both
students
involved
as
well
as
the
school
parents
and
teachers
from
an
educational
standpoint
both
students
will
benefit
by
sharing
knowledge
and
insights
from
a
variety
of
experiences
for
the
younger
student
the
program
can
create
a
sense
of
purpose
and
allow
them
to
take
on
more
responsibility
as
they
develop
social
and
organizational
skills
for
the
older
student
it
can
lead
to
increased
confidence
from
offering
help
and
guidance
and
fostering
a
stronger
relationship
with
their
educators
furthermore
the
program
increases
school
morale
and
parental
involvement
within
the
educational
setting
as
both
parents
and
teachers
are
encouraged
to
work
as
a
team
in
providing
the
best
opportunity
for
the
student
ultimately
this
program
provides
an
invaluable
educational
experience
for
both
the
older
and
younger
students
helping
to
create
a
vibrant
and
supportive
learning
environment
the
argument
over
whether
teenagers
should
have
a
pm
curfew
revolves
around
the
tradeoff
between
safety
and
rest
has
shown
a
direct
correlation
between
lack
of
sleep
and
poor
academic
performance
risky
behavior
depression
and
other
issues
among
adolescents
for
these
reasons
many
parents
and
experts
feel
there
are
benefits
to
a
pm
curfew
as
it
sets
a
framework
for
teens
to
get
enough
rest
while
still
being
able
to
maintain
an
active
lifestyle
on
the
other
hand
there
may
be
counter arguments
to
a
pm
curfew
such
as
the
fact
that
teens
may
simply
stay
home
rather
than
engage
in
activities
that
contribute
to
their
development
and
growth
as
well
some
people
may
consider
a
pm
curfew
as
overbearing
potentially
giving
parents
too
much
control
over
their
children
in
conclusion
while
the
benefits
of
a
pm
curfew
should
not
be
overlooked
it
s
important
to
take
into
consideration
the
potential
drawbacks
that
come
with
it
the
goal
should
be
to
find
a
happy
medium
that
provides
both
safety
and
adequate
rest
to
teenagers
the
right
to
choose
elective
classes
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
students
this
choice
allows
students
to
explore
different
interests
diversify
their
education
and
pursue
passions
both
in
and
outside
of
their
normal
academic
endeavors
forcing
students
to
take
every
elective
class
can
be
a
waste
of
time
because
it
does
not
allow
for
students
to
follow
natural
inclinations
that
are
unique
to
them
not
every
student
enjoys
the
same
classes
and
it
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
student
teacher
and
school
system
if
students
are
able
to
explore
what
they
are
genuinely
interested
in
this
will
encourage
diligent
study
and
draw
out
a
creative
and
thoughtful
approach
to
new
material
having
the
freedom
to
pick
and
choose
elective
classes
can
also
open
the
student
up
to
unexpected
interests
they
may
not
have
known
to
have
before
requiring
students
to
take
a
certain
set
of
elective
classes
could
also
result
in
a
time consuming
process
without
a
significant
educational
benefit
students
can
be
made
to
complete
classes
they
have
little
interest
in
joining
in
lectures
with
minimal
engagement
or
enthusiasm
if
students
had
more
choice
their
motivation
and
improved
engagement
could
lead
to
better
learning
in
conclusion
allowing
students
the
choice
of
what
elective
classes
to
take
is
of
the
utmost
importance
offering
students
the
ability
to
evaluate
each
class
and
make
an
informed
decision
about
their
own
personal
education
can
have
significant
impacts
on
both
the
teaching
staff
and
the
student
body
boosting
motivation
to
learn
and
succeed
in
their
studies
the
advancement
of
technology
has
caused
many
negative
impacts
on
people
s
lives
ranging
from
cultural
social
and
emotional
issues
to
intellectual
ones
culture
is
the
most
significantly
affected
technology
has
created
a
more
homogenous
and
globalized
society
in
which
different
cultures
can
easily
interact
and
exchange
ideas
in
ways
never
before
possible
this
has
many
positive
effects
but
has
also
caused
many
cultures
to
feel
homogenized
or
to
disappear
altogether
when
it
comes
to
communication
technology
is
largely
responsible
for
both
good
and
bad
on
the
one
hand
technology
has
made
it
easier
than
ever
to
connect
with
people
from
around
the
world
but
this
has
also
caused
a
reliance
on
screens
and
keyboards
as
opposed
to
face to face
interaction
ironically
the
tools
that
connect
us
have
caused
many
of
us
to
become
disconnected
from
those
around
us
in
terms
of
knowledge
technology
has
made
valuable
information
available
to
all
but
has
also
caused
a
decrease
in
analytical
and
critical
thinking
skills
with
the
ease
of
access
to
information
many
people
no
longer
take
the
time
to
carefully
analyze
and
reflect
on
issues
technology
has
had
a
detrimental
effect
on
curiosity
with
the
abundance
of
information
at
our
fingertips
the
time
and
effort
spent
exploring
and
discovering
new
things
are
on
a
downward
trend
lastly
technology
has
had
a
profound
effect
on
our
happiness
while
technology
has
a
vast
array
of
benefits
it
has
the
potential
to
lead
to
feelings
of
isolation
depression
and
anxiety
when
misused
oftentimes
people
are
so
consumed
with
technology
that
they
displace
their
relationships
with
real
people
in
conclusion
it
is
obvious
that
while
technology
has
an
array
of
positives
it
has
also
caused
many
serious
and
long lasting
negative
effects
on
people
s
lives
from
cultural
homogenization
and
the
displacement
of
real world
communication
to
decreased
curiosity
and
overall
happiness
it
is
important
to
remember
the
importance
of
managing
technology
use
responsibly
and
proactively
extending
school
by
two
hours
has
been
proposed
in
the
past
as
a
way
to
improve
students
academic
performance
and
overall
well being
although
this
may
seem
ideal
on
paper
this
extended
model
is
not
without
issue
fathers
may
become
less
present
and
involved
in
their
children
s
lives
with
the
extended
school
day
fathers
have
less
time
to
spend
with
their
children
and
in
some
cases
these
extra
two
hours
are
better
spent
in
pursuit
of
a
career
or
another
passion
fathers
want
to
be
involved
in
the
lives
of
their
children
so
extending
the
school
day
may
create
tension
and
discontent
within
the
home
extended
school
days
may
place
too
much
strain
on
students
longer
day
means
more
hours
of
learning
and
responsibility
this
not
only
takes
time
away
from
relaxing
at
home
but
also
may
cause
students
to
become
burned
out
and
disconnected
from
the
physical
and
mental
activities
that
can
improve
their
strengths
and
well being
with
an
extended
school
day
students
may
not
have
the
time
to
explore
other
activities
that
are
important
for
their
own
development
such
activities
may
include
sports
music
lessons
and
volunteer
work
activities
that
involve
the
body
and
the
mind
and
that
are
necessary
to
a
rounded
curriculum
finally
there
are
other
alternatives
instead
of
extending
the
school
day
these
include
early
start
programs
where
students
start
their
day
two
hours
earlier
or
lengthening
the
entire
school
year
by
keeping
the
school
day
the
same
but
battle
this
pacing
battle
by
lengthening
the
entire
school
year
schools
are
providing
more
time
for
students
to
learn
and
discover
in
conclusion
there
are
serious
drawbacks
to
extending
the
school
day
these
drawbacks
include
possible
disconnection
of
fathers
with
their
children
increased
strain
on
students
lost
time
for
other
activities
important
for
development
and
the
introduction
of
alternative
ideas
to
helping
students
succeed
introducing
a
homework
club
can
be
beneficial
to
students
for
a
variety
of
reasons
from
developing
important
skills
to
forging
a
sense
of
community
assignments
that
involve
complex
problem solving
research
and
writing
can
be
difficult
for
many
students
and
a
homework
club
offers
the
opportunity
to
collaborate
in
a
constructive
and
supportive
environment
this
interactive
environment
can
lead
to
deeper
understanding
of
material
as
well
as
a
broader
network
of
knowledge
since
members
can
draw
on
each
other
s
unique
strengths
and
experiences
working
on
assignments
as
part
of
a
team
can
also
help
students
develop
their
social
and
communication
skills
as
well
as
their
ability
to
work
as
part
of
a
cohesive
group
being
in
such
an
environment
can
also
boost
confidence
and
self esteem
since
it
provides
a
platform
for
individuals
to
share
their
opinions
and
solutions
while
encouraging
others
finally
a
homework
club
can
provide
a
sense
of
camaraderie
as
members
come
together
to
work
on
their
studies
while
supporting
each
other
therefore
creating
a
homework
club
can
be
an
important
learning
resource
for
students
enabling
them
to
work
together
fruitfully
for
mutual
growth
and
development
success
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
said
reflecting
on
the
importance
of
failure
on
the
path
to
success
it
is
an
integral
role
and
often
presents
learning
opportunities
when
things
do
n t
go
the
way
they
were
planned
with
each
failure
people
gain
insight
into
what
went
wrong
and
can
learn
how
to
improve
the
situation
next
time
not
only
that
but
failing
gives
us
the
chance
to
build
underlying
strength
resilience
and
perseverance
that
help
propel
us
on
our
journey
towards
success
not
only
can
failure
bring
about
success
but
it
often
makes
us
better
human
beings
with
strong
character
traits
that
help
us
succeed
in
the
long
run
dear
i
m
writing
to
express
my
views
on
the
school
s
new
sports
policy
as
you
know
the
policy
has
had
a
significant
impact
on
our
student
body
myself
included
i
strongly
believe
that
all
students
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
sports
they
wish
to
take
part
in
no
matter
their
interests
or
abilities
not
only
does
this
provide
students
with
a
much needed
outlet
for
creative
expression
but
it
also
encourages
physical
activity
and
healthy
competition
unfortunately
there
are
some
students
who
have
been
severely
impacted
by
this
policy
who
are
now
turning
to
criminal
activities
as
a
result
although
the
policy
states
that
students
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
play
their
chosen
sport
many
are
not
being
given
the
same
treatment
as
a
consequence
some
students
are
dropping
out
pursuing
illicit
activities
and
in
some
cases
becoming
victims
themselves
this
is
a
disservice
to
these
students
as
well
as
a
huge
source
of
disruption
to
the
school
i
believe
that
it
is
essential
to
provide
all
students
with
the
chance
to
participate
in
the
sports
they
are
interested
in
as
this
can
help
foster
a
positive
environment
and
reduce
the
chances
of
criminal
activity
it
is
my
hope
that
the
school
will
reconsider
its
current
policy
and
make
adjustments
to
ensure
that
everyone
has
the
opportunity
to
take
part
you
for
your
time
sincerely
your
name
when
discussing
success
one
of
the
first
things
that
come
to
mind
is
soccer
the
careers
of
soccer
players
have
always
been
inspiring
and
motivational
as
they
exemplify
the
beauty
of
hard
work
paying
off
but
behind
the
glamor
the
stories
of
these
players
include
many
challenges
and
difficult
paths
in
soccer
often
comes
from
dedication
and
sacrifice
requiring
players
to
spend
countless
hours
in
training
managing
expectations
and
mastering
the
craft
to
truly
become
successful
players
must
be
able
to
overcome
any
obstacle
they
face
from
battling
injuries
to
dealing
with
discouragement
is
a
common
challenge
that
can
hold
people
back
from
achieving
success
as
anyone
who
has
ever
struggled
with
a
lack
of
motivation
can
attest
to
it
can
be
difficult
to
break
the
cycle
to
overcome
this
people
must
identify
the
root
causes
and
focus
on
the
end
goal
using
positive
motivation
and
visualizating
a
desired
outcome
while
external
praise
and
rewards
can
certainly
be
motivating
it
is
important
to
focus
on
intrinsic
rewards
that
depend
solely
on
personal
efforts
as
this
will
allow
an
individual
to
better
sustain
longterm
motivation
by
setting
goals
and
continually
pushing
towards
them
individuals
can
make
progress
and
become
successful
it
is
important
to
stay
focused
on
the
process
and
to
be
passionate
about
pursuing
dreams
and
aspirations
with
hard
work
and
dedication
anyone
can
reach
the
heights
of
success
just
as
so
many
successful
soccer
players
have
done
in
the
past
imagination
is
an
essential
part
of
the
human
experience
and
the
need
for
it
surpasses
that
of
knowledge
in
many
areas
of
life
from
early
childhood
activities
such
as
math
building
and
drawing designing
imagination
plays
an
incredibly
important
role
in
mathematics
for
instance
imagination
allows
us
to
create
new
equations
solve
problems
or
make
improvements
to
existing
models
with
building
imagination
is
the
key
to
creating
new
structures
inventing
new
tools
and
developing
creative
solutions
to
complex
technical
problems
and
finally
with
drawing
and
designing
imagination
is
the
foundation
for
creating
works
of
art
that
express
the
uniqueness
of
an
individual
s
personality
famously
said
is
more
important
than
knowledge
for
knowledge
is
limited
to
all
we
now
know
and
understand
while
imagination
embraces
the
entire
world
and
all
there
ever
will
be
to
know
and
understand
when
presented
with
this
quote
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
imagination
is
so
critical
in
life
it
is
the
driving
force
behind
true
innovation
and
creativity
enabling
people
to
step
out
of
their
comfort
zones
to
create
something
that
has
never
been
thought
of
before
ultimately
it
is
imagination
that
allows
us
to
dream
and
reach
out
into
the
unknown
to
explore
all
the
possibilities
life
has
to
offer
living
in
a
world
where
people
try
to
force
others
to
conform
can
be
incredibly
detrimental
to
our
well being
both
mentally
and
physically
by
being
pressured
into
conforming
we
risk
sacrificing
our
individual
sense
of
identity
and
originality
for
the
sake
of
fitting
in
among
everyone
else
we
may
try
to
emulate
the
behaviors
and
looks
that
those
around
us
have
adopted
and
in
doing
so
we
may
be
blind
to
our
own
carefully
crafted
uniqueness
we
may
also
become
lost
in
a
sea
of
sameness
where
it
seems
as
though
everyone
experiences
the
same
scenarios
and
the
same
trials
and
tribulations
by
refusing
to
highlight
our
individual
preferences
beliefs
and
even
our
quirks
we
may
end
up
leaving
ourselves
isolated
and
disconnected
from
other
people
it
is
important
to
remember
that
by
embracing
our
distinctive
characteristics
we
are
able
to
form
individual
opinions
and
interpretations
of
the
world
and
this
can
lead
to
better
understanding
of
ourselves
our
peers
and
the
world
as
a
whole
finally
there
is
an
element
of
danger
in
trying
to
fit
into
a
group
if
it
involves
participating
in
activities
that
deviate
from
our
personal
moral
and
ethical
standards
we
risk
subscrib
ing
to
some
potentially
harmful
ideas
which
can
in
the
long
run
prove
extremely
detrimental
for
us
in
conclusion
living
in
a
world
where
people
try
to
force
others
to
conform
often
leads
to
very
negative
outcomes
in
order
to
stay
true
to
ourselves
we
must
evaluate
the
decisions
we
make
in
regards
to
conforming
to
the
behavior
of
those
around
us
and
make
sure
that
our
individual
values
are
not
compromised
in
the
process
is
filled
with
moments
of
joy
as
well
as
times
of
struggle
it
is
all
too
easy
to
become
discouraged
or
overwhelmed
in
the
face
of
setbacks
and
opposition
to
sustain
enthusiasm
and
resilience
throughout
our
lives
in
order
to
achieve
our
goals
it
is
important
to
develop
our
own
personal
strategies
for
dealing
with
depression
and
disappointment
one
strategy
is
to
focus
on
the
positives
in
any
situation
make
it
a
point
to
savor
accomplishments
and
embrace
the
journey
of
learning
and
growth
even
if
it
s
during
a
difficult
period
another
key
approach
is
to
foster
a
positive
and
resilient
mindset
change
our
internal
dialogue
from
this
is
too
hard
to
i
can
do
this
family
and
friends
are
also
significant
resources
for
staying
motivated
having
an
accountability
partner
even
just
checking
in
every
once
in
a
while
can
remind
us
of
our
goals
and
inspire
us
to
make
progress
we
can
also
draw
strength
and
motivation
from
the
people
around
us
my
grandmother
for
example
kept
going
in
her
job
well
past
retirement
age
because
she
was
passionate
about
her
work
and
enjoyed
being
surrounded
by
a
positive
and
supportive
community
though
there
are
certain
challenges
that
life
throws
our
way
with
the
right
frame
of
mind
and
the
right
support
system
we
can
conquer
almost
anything
as
long
as
we
remember
to
stay
optimistic
stay
motivated
and
always
remember
why
we
are
striving
we
will
be
able
to
achieve
our
goals
as
i
explored
the
different
types
of
musical
instruments
i
discovered
the
rewards
that
playing
one
could
bring
i
decided
to
learn
the
violin
and
have
been
diligently
practicing
ever
since
i
joined
a
local
orchestra
and
had
the
pleasure
of
making
new
friends
who
shared
similar
interests
with
my
newfound
confidence
i
ve
even
begun
to
travel
to
different
states
and
connect
with
more
musicians
along
the
way
i
ve
learned
several
important
lessons
about
the
world
and
myself
most
notably
that
music
is
a
powerful
form
of
expression
and
communication
as
the
months
went
by
i
began
to
grow
more
confident
in
my
abilities
and
found
that
i
was
able
to
communicate
better
with
others
from
this
experience
i
ve
gained
an
appreciation
for
music
made
wonderful
new
friends
and
learned
more
than
i
ever
could
have
imagined
individual
competition
in
the
workplace
can
provide
beneficial
advantages
to
employees
looking
for
a
competitive
edge
it
can
foster
a
sense
of
competition
and
promote
healthy
risk taking
pushing
employees
out
of
their
comfort
zones
in
order
to
reach
higher
goals
for
those
who
are
successful
in
achieving
these
goals
the
rewards
of
the
competition
are
high
as
they
can
gain
recognition
and
experience
productive
growth
in
their
career
additionally
individual
competition
can
foster
creativity
and
innovation
as
challenges
can
act
as
an
incentive
to
solve
problems
quickly
and
find
new
more
efficient
solutions
competition
can
also
establish
personal
accountability
meaning
that
employees
are
more
likely
to
take
ownership
in
their
work
and
be
driven
to
produce
better
results
in
this
way
individual
competition
in
the
workplace
can
be
an
effective
tool
to
help
contribute
to
the
success
of
a
worker
as
society
progresses
further
we
are
increasingly
reliant
on
experts
to
guide
us
in
our
decisions
what
does
it
mean
to
be
an
expert
in
any
area
to
be
an
expert
is
to
be
an
authority
in
your
field
someone
who
others
turn
to
for
knowledge
and
advice
this
can
come
with
great
responsibility
but
with
it
also
come
certain
privileges
on
the
one
hand
being
an
expert
means
that
you
may
feel
a
large
burden
of
accountability
many
people
from
those
asking
the
questions
to
those
benefiting
from
the
answer
are
depending
on
the
accuracy
and
quality
of
your
work
this
can
be
difficult
as
it
is
not
always
easy
to
please
everyone
on
the
other
hand
being
an
expert
means
you
hold
a
certain
amount
of
power
due
to
your
knowledge
and
experience
it
can
be
easy
to
forget
the
power
that
comes
with
being
an
expert
but
those
who
can
remain
humble
and
wise
will
often
be
able
to
make
wiser
decisions
and
more
inspiring
leads
overall
it
is
a
great
honor
to
be
an
expert
in
any
field
holding
such
a
responsibility
means
that
you
will
have
the
potential
to
benefit
and
influence
many
people
however
one
should
never
forget
the
pressure
and
accountability
that
goes
alongside
such
a
position
and
should
strive
to
remain
humble
in
order
to
make
wise
and
informed
decisions
an
act
of
kindness
is
a
voluntary
act
of
generosity
it
is
a
selfless
act
that
can
be
done
with
no
expectation
of
recognition
or
reward
it
can
range
from
a
simple
thank
you
to
a
hug
or
to
an
extreme
act
such
as
donating
money
volunteering
time
or
helping
a
complete
stranger
the
primary
outcome
of
an
act
of
kindness
is
the
feeling
of
being
appreciated
and
valued
it
is
known
to
have
a
lasting
impact
on
people
and
improve
the
overall
safety
and
happiness
of
those
around
them
for
example
when
a
homeless
person
on
the
street
receives
a
hot
meal
or
a
trinket
from
a
passerby
the
feeling
of
kindness
and
the
appreciation
felt
can
spread
even
to
those
not
necessarily
involved
it
can
have
a
ripple
effect
within
the
community
inspiring
others
to
do
something
kind
for
someone
in
need
it
can
also
help
build
a
sense
of
community
bringing
people
together
that
would
have
otherwise
been
strangers
of
course
even
the
smallest
act
of
kindness
can
be
incredibly
powerful
helping
a
friend
in
need
lending
a
fresher
friend
some
notes
or
even
merely
smiling
can
make
a
big
difference
to
someone
the
mere
gesture
of
kindness
can
significantly
boost
a
person
s
self esteem
and
even
start
a
chain
reaction
of
kindness
partnering
with
companies
in
the
field
students
are
interested
in
pursuing
provides
a
wealth
of
benefits
through
such
partnerships
students
can
acquire
the
skills
knowledge
and
experience
necessary
to
succeed
in
their
chosen
career
student
partnerships
offer
the
opportunity
to
gain
real world
experience
and
exposure
to
the
industry
by
attending
conferences
and
seminars
networking
within
the
industry
or
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
the
company
s
technology
or
product
additionally
such
partnerships
give
students
the
chance
to
build
relationships
with
influential
people
which
can
lead
to
job
offers
internships
and
other
professional
benefits
however
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
these
partnerships
companies
are
looking
for
the
best
and
brightest
talent
and
some
students
may
feel
pressure
to
meet
these
expectations
furthermore
developing
relationships
with
industry
professionals
can
add
extra
time
demands
and
strain
to
an
already
busy
academic
schedule
lastly
there
is
the
risk
that
students
may
not
be
adequately
prepared
for
the
challenges
of
such
partnerships
so
it
is
important
to
assess
individual
capabilities
before
entering
into
a
student company
partnership
believed
that
productivity
was
essential
for
personal
growth
and
development
he
wrote
in
a
letter
to
determine
never
to
be
idle it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
recognized
the
potential
power
of
consistent
effort
and
encouraged
others
to
stay
busy
in
order
to
achieve
worthwhile
goals
at
the
same
time
believed
that
inactivity
could
have
an
important
role
to
play
in
how
we
use
our
time
in
his
view
moments
of
pause
could
lead
to
reflection
contemplation
and
self examination all
of
which
are
critical
mental
exercises
that
can
lead
to
increased
productivity
once
motivation
has
been
restored
when
seeking
to
maximize
our
productivity
it
is
important
to
differentiate
between
activities
and
productive
activities
activities
such
as
watching
tv
scrolling
through
social
media
or
playing
video
games
can
be
enjoyable
but
can
also
reduce
our
motivation
and
prevent
us
from
reaching
our
goals
productive
activities
such
as
research
problem solving
reading
and
project building
can
help
us
to
pursue
our
ambitions
and
are
important
for
personal
growth
to
accomplish
more
we
must
set
achievable
goals
and
use
our
time
wisely
to
achieve
our
goals
we
must
utilize
strategies
such
as
breaking
them
up
into
manageable
parts
setting
a
timeline
for
completion
and
utilizing
motivational
techniques
making
a
conscious
effort
to
focus
our
efforts
on
productive
activities
rather
than
idle
ones
may
also
help
us
to
be
more
successful
in
reaching
our
goals
taking
action
rather
than
being
a
passive
dreamer
has
three
key
advantages
taking
action
will
make
your
dreams
more
achievable
instead
of
languishing
in
the
hypothetical
you
can
take
concrete
steps
toward
making
your
goals
a
reality
for
example
if
you
want
to
get
a
new
job
you
can
take
action
by
researching
companies
in
your
industry
updating
your
resume
and
attending
networking
events
taking
action
helps
you
gain
momentum
when
you
take
one
step
it
s
easier
to
take
the
next
with
each
new
action
you
take
you
ll
find
yourself
closer
to
your
goal
for
example
if
you
re
starting
a
business
you
might
take
action
by
researching
potential
markets
writing
a
business
plan
and
creating
a
website
lastly
taking
action
can
help
you
make
meaningful
connections
taking
actions
in
pursuit
of
a
goal
can
open
you
up
to
new
relationships
and
collaborations
for
example
if
you
re
trying
to
launch
a
project
you
can
take
action
by
joining
relevant
groups
attending
local
meetups
and
actively
engaging
with
potential
collaborators
by
taking
action
as
opposed
to
just
dreaming
you
can
make
your
goals
more
achievable
gain
momentum
and
build
meaningful
connections
three
clear
reasons
to
take
action
rather
than
remain
inactive
homework
clubs
where
students
can
gather
to
work
on
school
assignments
have
been
shown
to
offer
a
number
of
potential
benefits
students
that
take
part
in
organized
homework
clubs
display
increased
engagement
in
school
and
improved
academic
performance
studies
have
also
shown
that
these
clubs
reduce
feelings
of
isolation
and
stress
and
can
provide
students
with
a
better
sense
of
community
during
their
school
years
from
the
teacher
perspective
the
availability
of
a
homework
club
can
provide
a
greater
opportunity
to
monitor
students
work
and
to
ensure
they
can
catch
up
on
course
work
if
they
miss
classes
at
the
same
time
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
teachers
may
not
be
available
to
help
with
specific
coursework
during
homework
clubs
thus
making
it
difficult
for
students
to
access
help
for
questions
related
to
the
subject
material
moreover
a
lack
of
resources
or
funding
may
limit
the
effectiveness
of
the
program
or
make
it
difficult
to
sustain
long term
it
is
important
to
consider
all
the
potential
pros
and
cons
of
having
a
homework
club
in
schools
as
part
of
an
overall
approach
to
student
engagement
mental
health
and
academic
success
with
proper
resources
teachers
availability
and
student
engagement
the
benefits
of
a
homework
club
may
outweigh
the
risks
as
i
began
to
master
the
basics
of
coding
i
realized
that
i
had
a
newfound
confidence
in
my
abilities
what
i
had
previously
considered
to
be
so
far
out
of
my
reach
became
something
that
i
could
actually
achieve
suddenly
learning
something
new
felt
easier
as
i
had
a
solid
foundation
that
i
could
build
from
to
continue
learning
i
adopted
strategies
such
as
breaking
down
large
problems
into
smaller
ones
reviewing
the
solutions
to
challenges
others
had
faced
and
expanding
my
horizons
by
learning
new
coding
languages
i
also
observed
colleagues
who
had
already
mastered
one
skill
and
moved
onto
learning
another
they
taught
themselves
entirely
new
concepts
and
achieved
amazing
results
the
mastery
of
something
not
only
gave
me
confidence
but
also
encouraged
me
to
keep
pushing
the
boundaries
of
what
i
can
learn
and
what
i
can
do
with
each
new
challenge
i
tackle
i
am
reminded
of
the
possibilities
that
await
spending
time
at
a
community
park
has
abundant
benefits
both
for
individuals
and
for
the
communities
they
come
from
for
friends
and
family
it
can
be
an
excellent
way
to
build
strong
bonds
with
opportunities
to
play
games
talk
and
just
spend
time
together
exercise
is
also
easily
integrated
into
a
park
outing
whether
it
be
walking
running
cycling
or
playing
sports
for
students
parks
can
also
offer
the
perfect
environment
to
get
away
from
noisy
and
distracting
environments
and
to
focus
on
completing
school
work
in
a
peaceful
natural
setting
all
in
all
the
benefits
of
community
parks
are
undeniable
service
is
an
invaluable
asset
to
society
as
it
allows
individuals
to
become
better
citizens
of
their
communities
and
countries
it
also
serves
as
a
great
opportunity
for
youth
to
get
involved
with
their
local
communities
and
gain
hands on
experience
for
this
reason
it
is
important
for
schools
to
ensure
that
all
students
have
a
chance
to
partake
in
community
service
principals
can
decide
who
should
participate
in
community
service
in
a
few
ways
for
instance
they
could
require
each
student
to
complete
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
community
service
per
semester
host
activities
and
events
that
allow
students
to
participate
and
provide
credit
or
rewards
for
completed
projects
additionally
they
could
create
a
club
or
organization
that
provides
community
service
projects
or
partner
with
outside
organizations
that
do
the
same
as
an
example
an
elementary
school
principal
could
choose
to
partner
with
a
local
food
bank
and
provide
an
opportunity
for
students
to
volunteer
on
the
weekends
the
students
could
assist
in
stocking
shelves
sorting
donations
or
helping
to
package
meals
for
those
in
need
this
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
for
the
students
to
learn
about
the
importance
of
giving
back
to
their
community
while
providing
a
valuable
service
in
conclusion
community
service
is
an
essential
part
of
becoming
an
effective
citizen
should
prioritize
providing
students
with
opportunities
to
give
back
to
their
community
and
principals
should
ensure
that
all
students
have
a
chance
to
participate
as
schools
look
to
prepare
students
for
the
future
it
is
important
to
research
the
different
types
of
career
pathways
that
are
available
one
way
to
enable
students
to
gain
valuable
experience
is
to
partner
up
with
local
businesses
to
offer
educational
opportunities
these
opportunities
allow
students
to
understand
their
interests
and
appreciate
their
value
in
regards
to
their
future
in
addition
allowing
students
to
visit
businesses
and
learn
about
the
types
of
work
they
do
can
provide
a
number
of
potential
benefits
such
as
connecting
them
with
professionals
who
can
offer
guidance
by
research
the
different
types
of
career
pathways
available
and
partnering
with
local
businesses
to
provide
students
with
educational
opportunities
schools
can
help
their
students
become
more
aware
of
their
interests
and
the
potential
of
them
in
their
future
in
an
era
increasingly
dominated
by
technology
it
s
easy
to
forget
how
crucial
human
connections
are
in
our
daily
lives
emails
social
media
platforms
and
video
calls
can
bridge
distances
but
they
can
not
replace
the
physical
presence
of
another
person
that
s
why
it
s
essential
that
we
take
a
break
from
technology
now
and
then
and
simply
speak
to
one
another
talking
to
people not
just
online
but
face to face plays
a
vital
role
in
encouraging
emotional
connections
it
gives
us
a
chance
to
step
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
become
more
mindful
of
our
surroundings
and
share
something
meaningful
with
someone
else
in
addition
to
that
conversing
with
someone
can
help
reduce
stress
and
anxiety
improve
a
person
s
outlook
on
life
and
foster
a
sense
of
belonging
it
s
important
to
remember
that
human
connection
takes
effort
not
everyone
is
comfortable
talking
about
their
emotions
or
problems
and
that
s
okay
even
small
talk
can
be
beneficial it
s
still
an
opportunity
to
practice
conversation
and
maintain
social
norms
taking
regular
breaks
from
technology
and
talking
to
someone
can
boost
your
overall
well being
and
make
a
lasting
impact
in
your
life
responsibility
and
hard
work
are
incredibly
important
qualities
for
employees
to
possess
in
the
workplace
employers
are
looking
for
employees
who
show
dependability
loyalty
and
who
can
be
trusted
to
complete
tasks
assigned
to
them
work
is
also
something
employers
look
for
as
it
is
key
to
success
in
any
workplace
employees
who
put
in
the
extra
effort
to
ensure
the
best
possible
outcome
who
go
above
and
beyond
the
assigned
task
and
who
demonstrate
a
good
attitude
and
enthusiasm
are
well
respected
by
employers
having
a
sense
of
responsibility
in
the
workplace
is
important
for
staying
on
task
and
showing
employers
that
their
employees
are
reliable
it
also
boosts
morale
and
encourages
employees
to
manage
their
tasks
better
as
well
as
encourages
productivity
and
punctuality
work
goes
hand
in
hand
with
responsibility
as
employees
who
demonstrate
a
dedication
to
their
job
are
more
likely
to
achieve
positive
results
work
also
helps
to
improve
skills
as
employees
are
constantly
pushed
to
improve
their
performance
responsibility
and
hard
work
in
the
workplace
will
help
an
employee
progress
in
their
career
as
employers
respect
and
reward
those
who
strive
for
success
having
a
good
work
ethic
is
something
employers
actively
seek
as
it
reflects
the
employee
s
commitment
and
passion
for
their
job
work
and
responsibility
are
qualities
that
employers
look
for
when
hiring
and
promoting

they
are
integral
in
successful
careers
never
listened
to
his
parents
about
the
risks
of
drugs
in
his
high
school
he
thought
it
only
applied
to
some
people
but
not
him
he
started
experimenting
with
marijuana
and
soon
was
using
harder
drugs
like
cocaine
his
life
spiraled
out
of
control
and
was
soon
spending
a
considerable
amount
of
time
and
money
trying
to
get
his
next
fix
he
soon
found
himself
in
jail
and
with
no
degree
or
other
skills
found
it
difficult
to
get
back
on
his
feet
after
being
released
on
the
other
hand
did
n t
take
her
friends
warnings
about
the
danger
of
college
partying
too
seriously
either
she
decided
to
ignore
their
advice
and
often
went
out
drinking
with
her
friends
on
the
weekends
however
was
lucky
and
although
she
had
a
few
embarrassing
moments
she
managed
to
keep
control
of
her
life
her
education
was
not
impacted
and
ended
up
graduating
with
a
degree
in
biology
she
now
has
a
well paying
job
and
is
happy
with
the
decisions
she
made
in
conclusion
both
and
failed
to
listen
to
the
warnings
of
those
close
to
them
but
experienced
different
outcomes
while
suffered
greatly
due
to
his
drug
use
was
able
to
recognize
her
limits
and
still
successfully
complete
her
degree
first
impressions
are
powerful
they
can
shape
our
behavior
towards
a
person
in
an
often
unintentional
or
unconscious
manner
it
s
amazing
how
one
look
or
response
in
a
meeting
can
make
our
opinion
of
a
person
but
what
s
even
more
special
is
that
sometimes
these
impressions
are
so
powerful
that
no
matter
what
a
person
does
after
the
first
impression
remains
unchanged
this
can
be
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
on
the
one
hand
first
impressions
may
help
us
pick
up
on
traits
of
a
person
we
may
have
otherwise
overlooked
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
difficult
to
sort
out
our
own
preconceptions
and
remain
open minded
that
s
why
it
s
important
to
remember
that
first
impressions
do
n t
always
tell
the
full
story
despite
this
it
s
important
to
accept
people
for
who
they
are
and
respect
them
rather
than
falling
back
on
our
own
preconceptions
seeking
multiple
opinions
from
different
people
can
be
extremely
beneficial
in
many
situations
for
example
when
making
important
decisions
it
can
be
beneficial
to
get
a
variety
of
perspectives
in
order
to
challenge
our
own
beliefs
and
gain
new
and
unbiased
insights
additionally
obtaining
a
multitude
of
opinions
can
help
us
to
identify
potential
flaws
in
our
thinking
and
to
come
up
with
creative
solutions
that
we
might
not
have
considered
otherwise
furthermore
when
gathering
opinions
from
people
who
possess
different
skills
and
experience
we
are
able
to
gain
access
to
a
broad
range
of
expertise
and
knowledge
that
can
help
to
inform
our
choices
finally
having
multiple
people
add
their
unique
perspectives
can
give
us
the
confidence
to
make
more
informed
decisions
as
our
research
has
indicated
there
are
a
variety
of
community
service
requirements
for
elementary
school
students
that
have
been
implemented
in
our
school
district
to
further
benefit
our
students
and
the
district
i
am
proposing
a
program
that
would
require
our
students
to
participate
in
community
service
as
part
of
our
curriculum
this
program
comes
with
a
variety
of
benefits
including
the
development
of
a
greater
sense
of
social
responsibility
increased
awareness
of
important
social
issues
improved
academic
performance
and
enhanced
interpersonal
and
leadership
skills
furthermore
this
requirement
would
help
our
students
gain
valuable
communication
and
problem solving
skills
as
well
as
better
understand
the
needs
of
the
community
around
them
in
order
to
ensure
that
all
our
students
are
able
to
participate
in
the
program
we
need
to
put
in
place
certain
criteria
that
would
identify
those
who
are
interested
in
participating
in
the
program
we
would
need
to
identify
qualified
tutors
that
could
supervise
our
students
during
the
program
and
arrange
the
necessary
transportation
for
those
who
might
need
it
additionally
by
asking
our
parents
and
local
community
to
make
donations
we
will
be
able
to
provide
any
resources
or
materials
that
might
be
necessary
for
our
program
finally
we
need
to
decide
on
the
activities
and
length
of
the
program
in
order
to
ensure
that
we
can
provide
a
meaningful
experience
for
our
students
is
an
elusive
goal
that
requires
hard
work
dedication
and
an
unwavering
commitment
to
never
give
up
every
successful
person
has
faced
setbacks
disappointments
and
numerous
challenges
but
they
never
gave
up
they
kept
going
even
in
the
face
of
adversity
when
we
keep
pushing
forward
despite
life
s
obstacles
we
learn
to
appreciate
the
hard earned
victories
that
come
with
success
when
we
persist
in
spite
of
challenges
we
become
stronger
and
more
capable
the
effort
and
energy
we
put
in
comes
at
a
cost
but
we
learn
valuable
lessons
along
the
way
which
can
later
be
applied
in
our
personal
and
professional
lives
every
situation
no
matter
how
difficult
is
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
with
each
victory
we
become
more
confident
and
optimistic
the
belief
that
we
can
overcome
any
obstacle
gives
us
the
courage
and
strength
to
keep
fighting
another
advantage
of
not
giving
up
prematurely
is
that
we
learn
how
to
face
our
fears
and
push
through
if
we
stop
whenever
things
become
inconvenient
our
potential
will
never
be
reached
we
must
be
willing
to
take
risks
and
accept
that
failure
is
part
of
the
process
with
patience
and
practice
we
learn
how
to
find
solutions
and
move
past
any
problem
in
order
to
reach
our
fullest
potential
it
is
important
to
never
give
up
we
must
have
a
resilient
mentality
and
an
optimistic
outlook
in
order
to
ensure
success
we
must
be
willing
to
put
in
the
effort
necessary
to
reach
our
goals
not
giving
up
despite
challenges
is
essential
to
achieving
success
s
statement
that
until
one
is
committed
there
is
hesitancy
the
chance
to
draw
back
always
ineffectiveness
concerning
all
acts
of
initiative
and
creation
there
is
one
elementary
truth
that
ignorance
of
which
kills
countless
ideas
and
splendid
plans
that
the
moment
one
definitely
commits
oneself
then
moves
too
speaks
to
embracing
the
benefits
of
trying
something
new
and
going
beyond
one
s
comfort
zone
eating
a
healthy
diet
is
one
example
of
expanding
one
s
horizons
by
eating
nutritious
foods
one
can
gain
the
energy
and
minerals
needed
to
perform
the

to

in

an
iconic
philosopher
once
said
do
not
go
where
the
path
may
lead
instead
where
there
is
no
path
and
leave
a
trail
this
quote
contains
a
powerful
message
that
we
can
all
strive
to
achieve
anything
we
set
our
minds
to
no
matter
how
daunting
the
task
recently
i
have
researched
new
things
i
want
to
try
such
as
learning
a
foreign
language
writing
a
novel
or
traveling
to
a
new
country
to
accomplish
such
goals
i
have
outlined
a
process
of
setting
small
achievable
goals
that
will
eventually
lead
to
the
larger
goal
for
each
smaller
goal
i
plan
to
dedicate
the
time
and
effort
necessary
to
achieve
it
knowing
that
the
outcome
is
not
guaranteed
i
am
keeping
an
open
mind
and
reminding
myself
that
nothing
is
impossible
given
the
right
amount
of
perseverance
and
hard
work
just
as
important
as
it
is
to
push
yourself
and
challenge
yourself
it
is
also
important
to
realize
that
failure
is
a
part
of
life
instead
of
getting
stuck
in
the
fear
of
the
unknown
it
is
important
to
take
risks
and
try
something
new
failure
is
inevitable
but
it
can
also
be
a
learning
experience
that
will
help
you
although
such
lessons
may
be
hard
to
learn
the
difference
between
people
who
limit
themselves
and
those
who
aim
for
the
stars
is
the
willingness
to
take
chances
and
face
the
fear
of
the
unknown
to
have
a
successful
life
it
is
necessary
to
eliminate
the
fear
of
trying
something
new
and
challenge
yourself
to
go
out
of
your
comfort
zone
doing
this
will
allow
you
to
explore
new
things
gain
wisdom
and
experience
a
sense
of
personal
accomplishment
when
i
think
of
success
i
often
go
back
to
the
words
of
who
said
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
from
my
personal
life
experiences
i
believe
this
statement
to
be
incredibly
true
when
i
have
faced
difficulties
in
the
past
i
was
able
to
push
through
these
hard
times
with
enthusiasm
and
optimism
without
this
attitude
of
enthusiasm
i
would
have
given
up
much
sooner
this
statement
taught
me
the
importance
of
remaining
passionate
and
determined
no
matter
what
challenges
were
thrown
my
way
i
think
the
statement
is
an
important
one
for
others
to
remember
no
matter
the
endeavor
they
are
involved
in
times
are
inevitable
and
this
statement
can
inspire
people
to
grit
their
teeth
stay
enthusiastic
and
eventually
reach
their
goal
despite
any
failures
it
can
help
people
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
find
new
solutions
in
order
to
continue
towards
success
furthermore
it
emphasizes
the
importance
of
having
a
positive
frame
of
mind
in
order
to
achieve
whatever
they
set
out
to
do
distance
learning
is
a
popular
alternative
to
in person
classes
at
school
offering
more
flexible
class
schedules
and
allowing
students
to
learn
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
while
online
learning
can
generally
be
more
convenient
and
cost effective
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
as
well
for
instance
distance
learning
may
lack
the
social
aspect
of
traditional
school
classes
often
give
students
the
opportunity
to
connect
with
their
peers
and
teachers
providing
collaborative
learning
experiences
in
addition
it
can
be
more
difficult
to
stay
motivated
with
distance
learning
as
students
do
n t
have
structured
environments
or
built in
support
systems
on
the
other
hand
distance
learning
can
provide
more
freedom
and
flexibility
for
students
with
busy
schedules
with
more
advanced
technology
online
learning
can
offer
interactive
resources
and
additional
content
that
may
be
difficult
to
duplicate
in
traditional
settings
moreover
distance
learning
may
offer
more
personalized
instruction
since
teachers
can
work
closely
with
individual
students
or
small
groups
distance
learning
and
in person
learning
both
offer
unique
benefits
and
drawbacks
and
each
type
of
instruction
has
its
own
advantages
it
all
depends
on
the
student
s
individual
needs
and
preferences
after
researching
potential
opportunities
to
visit
companies
i
was
interested
in
software
programming
and
computer
management
i
applied
to
an
opportunity
to
visit
a
facility
in
order
to
gain
experience
with
product
creation
and
computer
troubleshooting
while
there
i
had
the
opportunity
to
work
side
by
side
with
computer
engineers
to
develop
innovative
software
products
and
find
solutions
to
complex
computer
problems
i
left
with
a
wealth
of
knowledge
regarding
computer
programming
and
troubleshooting
that
i
can
apply
to
my
own
work
the
benefits
of
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
are
numerous
not
only
do
they
provide
students
with
an
opportunity
to
practice
real world
skills
relevant
to
their
fields
of
interest
they
also
bolster
a
student
s
overall
educational
experience
help
foster
creativity
and
even
increase
a
student
s
chances
of
obtaining
employment
upon
graduation
however
one
factor
that
should
be
considered
when
researching
the
impact
of
extracurricular
activities
on
a
student
s
grades
is
the
amount
of
time
they
need
to
devote
to
the
activity
the
more
time
they
take
away
from
academic
pursuits
the
more
likely
it
is
to
impact
their
grade point
average
this
means
that
grades
should
factor
into
a
student
s
ability
to
participate
in
activities
and
they
should
be
willing
and
able
to
balance
their
academic
performance
with
their
extra curricular
activities
in
his
essay
on
and
argues
that
we
should
embrace
labor
and
constant
movement
in
order
to
live
our
most
fulfilling
lives
he
believes
that
it
is
excellence
rather
than
idleness
or
comfort
that
create
true
happiness
he
states
that
incessant
execution
of
labor
is
the
only
proof
of
our
existence
and
as
long
as
we
are
executing
we
cease
to
be
mere
shadows
and
become
real
and
living
things
s
perspective
can
be
applied
to
the
world
today
by
valuing
effort
and
dedication
in
the
modern
era
hard
work
is
often
a
key
factor
in
finding
success
and
achieving
individual
goals
for
example
when
studying
for
a
degree
or
preparing
for
a
job
interview
the
amount
of
effort
and
dedication
a
person
puts
into
their
task
will
be
reflected
in
the
results
the
same
principle
can
be
applied
to
any
challenge
those
who
strive
to
excel
and
devote
themselves
to
their
tasks
will
be
rewarded
with
greater
satisfaction
and
personal
growth
in
conclusion
s
views
on
constant
work
and
motion
can
be
applicable
to
the
world
today
while
hard
work
and
dedication
may
not
always
have
an
immediate
reward
in
the
long
run
they
enable
us
to
lead
more
fulfilling
lives
and
excel
in
whatever
challenge
we
face
a
winner
and
president
of
is
a
powerful
example
of
how
embracing
one
s
individuality
can
be
empowering
particularly
in
moments
of
uncertainty
despite
facing
adversity
embraced
his
distinctive
identity
and
fought
for
his
principles
despite
being
imprisoned
for
decades
by
the
south
african
government
for
his
political
beliefs
never
abandoned
his
commitment
to
justice
and
his
pursuit
of
equality
for
all
people
the
strength
of
character
that
displayed
in
pursuit
of
his
goals
standing
in
defiance
of
the
norms
of
the
time
demonstrated
that
embracing
one
s
uniqueness
is
essential
to
overcoming
difficult
obstacles
his
refusal
to
accept
the
status
quo
and
embrace
his
own
authentic
individual
identity
empowered
him
to
continue
his
advocacy
for
justice
and
his
pursuit
of
a
better
life
for
all
africans
no
matter
their
background
ultimately
s
story
serves
as
a
reminder
of
the
importance
of
embracing
one
s
individuality
and
not
cowering
in
moments
of
uncertainty
we
must
remember
to
draw
strength
from
our
own
individual
identities
when
it
matters
the
most
and
to
use
that
strength
to
fight
for
what
matters
in
our
lives
by
embracing
our
individual
uniqueness
we
can
all
look
to
as
an
example
of
how
great
change
is
possible
even
in
the
face
of
great
difficulty
the
debate
surrounding
the
mandatory
requirement
for
students
to
take
music
drama
art
or
other
elective
classes
in
order
to
graduate
high
school
carries
rich
nuances
on
the
one
hand
having
to
participate
in
a
mandatory
class
of
this
kind
can
be
seen
as
a
form
of
exploration
exposing
teens
to
opportunities
they
might
not
have
otherwise
sought
out
it
can
also
be
seen
to
help
foster
creativity
and
impart
interpersonal
skills
that
can
prove
beneficial
both
inside
and
outside
the
classroom
setting
on
the
other
hand
many
view
these
mandatory
classes
as
more
of
a
nuisance
than
a
boon
for
students
as
they
can
be
seen
as
detracting
from
the
more
significant
courses
and
studies
necessary
to
prepare
students
for
college
for
students
who
may
not
have
a
developed
interest
in
the
chosen
subject
this
can
be
an
imposition
forcing
them
to
take
time
away
from
their
core
studies
it
is
for
this
reason
that
such
policies
have
often
raised
the
issue
of
equity
when
it
comes
to
students
especially
those
from
underserved
or
disadvantaged
backgrounds
in
conclusion
when
it
comes
to
the
policy
of
requiring
students
to
take
music
drama
art
or
other
elective
classes
to
graduate
high
school
it
is
clear
that
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
consider
ultimately
however
educators
and
school
administrators
will
have
to
weigh
up
the
potential
advantages
and
drawbacks
in
order
to
determine
what
the
right
course
of
action
should
be
year round
school
offers
tremendous
benefits
for
both
students
and
educators
one
major
benefit
for
students
is
greater
academic
achievement
with
year round
schooling
students
can
take
more
refresher
courses
throughout
the
year
in
order
to
maintain
their
skill
level
additionally
students
benefit
from
more
regular
opportunities
to
communicate
with
their
peers
and
teachers
resulting
in
improved
engagement
in
the
classroom
educators
also
benefit
from
year round
schooling
with
more
learning
happening
throughout
the
year
educators
can
spend
more
time
honing
the
skills
of
each
student
to
ensure
mastery
in
the
areas
of
focus
for
example
an
educator
might
spend
additional
time
with
a
student
who
needs
help
with
a
particular
subject
enabling
the
student
to
better
understand
and
retain
the
material
overall
year round
school
provides
a
great
opportunity
for
students
and
educators
to
work
together
to
achieve
academic
excellence
in
recent
years
many
students
have
opted
to
pursue
their
education
from
home
and
experience
the
new
way
of
distance
learning
as
with
any
major
decision
there
are
numerous
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
consider
learning
presents
several
advantages
including
cost
savings
convenience
and
ability
to
customize
one
s
own
learning
environment
with
distance
learning
students
are
able
to
study
and
learn
online
eliminating
the
need
to
attend
classes
in
person
this
can
be
especially
beneficial
for
students
who
are
pressed
for
time
or
need
to
work
around
other
commitments
additionally
distance
learning
often
provides
a
more
cost
effective
option
than
traditional
schooling
as
students
do
not
need
to
pay
for
transportation
or
expensive
textbooks
and
materials
despite
the
benefits
distance
learning
can
also
present
challenges
one
of
the
main
drawbacks
is
that
subtracting
the
human
presence
from
the
classroom
can
cause
distraction
and
loneliness
it
is
difficult
for
students
to
stay
motivated
and
organized
when
they
are
in
charge
of
their
own
time
management
and
the
lack
of
face to face
interaction
in
the
classroom
may
leave
students
feeling
isolated
in
addition
students
may
not
receive
the
same
level
of
individual
guidance
from
a
teacher
or
professor
so
they
must
be
proficient
in
self study
and
problem
solving
ultimately
whether
or
not
distance
learning
is
beneficial
will
largely
depend
on
an
individual
student
s
circumstances
and
learning
style
it
is
important
to
consider
the
possible
pros
and
cons
of
this
type
of
education
and
make
an
informed
decision
about
whether
taking
classes
from
home
is
the
best
choice
for
achieving
one
s
educational
goals
visiting
a
museum
is
a
great
opportunity
to
learn
and
explore
the
world
around
us
in
an
interactive
and
meaningful
way
not
only
can
it
be
a
fun
and
enjoyable
experience
for
friends
and
family
to
spend
time
together
but
it
can
also
provide
invaluable
educational
benefits
for
students
visiting
a
museum
is
a
great
way
to
better
understand
and
retain
information
learned
in
school
as
it
helps
to
put
real world
context
behind
concepts
studied
in
class
in
addition
getting
up
and
moving
around
the
museum
can
help
students
become
more
attentive
and
focused
to
school related
tasks
by
providing
an
enriching
environment
filled
with
activities
geared
towards
learning
museums
are
invaluable
resources
that
should
be
taken
advantage
of
in
summary
visits
to
museums
provide
numerous
educational
benefits
and
are
a
great
way
to
explore
the
world
around
us
learn
more
and
spend
quality
time
with
friends
and
family
an
extended
school
day
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
student
life
on
the
positive
side
extra
hours
could
lead
to
improved
academic
performance
students
would
have
more
time
to
complete
assignments
receive
extra
help
from
teachers
or
even
attend
additional
academic
or
extracurricular
activities
in
addition
the
long
days
may
provide
students
with
a
sense
of
structure
and
purpose
that
can
be
difficult
to
beat
at
home
on
the
other
hand
adding
hours
to
a
student
s
school
schedule
can
be
a
considerable
strain
leading
to
fewer
opportunities
for
leisure
or
extracurricular
activities
it
can
also
lead
to
increased
fatigue
anxiety
or
distraction
additionally
students
with
already busy
schedules
may
find
it
difficult
to
fit
the
extra
hours
into
their
day to day
lives
ultimately
the
decision
to
add
more
hours
to
the
school
day
should
be
taken
carefully
and
should
address
the
particular
needs
of
the
student
body
increased
hours
could
be
beneficial
if
balanced
properly
with
additional
restorative
activities
however
the
long
hours
of
a
fully
packed
schedule
can
be
difficult
for
many
students
to
manage
ultimately
adding
extra
hours
should
be
done
with
consideration
for
the
impact
on
the
student
s
academic
performance
extracurricular
activities
and
overall
quality
of
life
when
making
decisions
getting
multiple
opinions
can
be
helpful
in
improving
communication
skills
gathering
various
perspectives
can
give
an
advantageous
insight
into
a
situation
as
often
people
have
contrasting
views
offering
guidance
and
advice
gives
a
good
sense
of
direction
and
is
useful
when
wanting
to
help
others
in
the
future
the
benefits
of
multiple
opinions
are
numerous
and
can
be
life changing
thus
it
is
essential
to
talk
to
people
from
different
backgrounds
who
have
different
backgrounds
to
gain
valuable
insight
into
their
opinions
students
of
all
ages
share
our
classrooms
and
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
everyone
is
provided
with
a
safe
positive
and
rewarding
learning
environment
providing
younger
students
with
mentorship
and
guidance
from
older
students
can
help
foster
more
mature
and
socially
responsible
behavior
influence
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
ramifications
and
it
is
important
to
create
programs
that
address
the
general
safety
and
well being
of
younger
students
while
being
mindful
of
any
potential
risks
by
providing
younger
students
with
a
safe
and
productive
setting
for
learning
and
offering
mentorship
and
guidance
from
older
students
it
is
possible
to
create
a
program
that
promotes
good
behavior
and
a
positive
outlook
as
we
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
this
type
of
program
it
is
important
to
consider
any
potential
negative
consequences
of
older
students
having
an
influence
on
the
younger
ones
and
to
establish
ways
of
mitigating
any
adverse
effects
enacting
a
weekday
curfew
and
a
midnight
weekend
curfew
is
a
controversial
way
to
curb
crime
and
promote
healthy
lifestyles
among
teenagers
on
one
hand
this
measure
could
help
reduce
the
number
of
late night
incidents
involving
teenagers
promoting
their
safety
and
citizens
security
on
the
other
hand
it
could
also
restrict
their
freedom
and
limit
recreational
activities
for
teenagers
a
curfew
could
be
beneficial
in
keeping
them
out
of
potentially
dangerous
situations
and
limiting
exposure
to
dangerous
elements
in
the
streets
at
night
parents
would
also
benefit
from
a
curfew
as
it
can
reduce
anxiety
about
their
children
s
safety
and
reaffirm
their
trust
in
the
community
s
ability
to
protect
its
members
however
teenagers
may
feel
resentful
if
their
freedom
is
restricted
and
feel
deprived
of
opportunities
for
extracurricular
activities
and
late night
socializing
a
weekday
curfew
and
a
midnight
weekend
curfew
can
be
a
useful
tool
for
protecting
teenagers
and
reducing
crime
nevertheless
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
consequences
of
this
measure
on
teenagers
and
parents
and
look
for
creative
ways
to
ensure
a
balance
between
safety
and
enjoyment
every
student
has
their
own
set
of
reasons
for
wanting
to
or
not
finishing
school
but
a
critical
factor
is
their
access
to
support
and
guidance
parents
have
a
great
responsibility
in
ensuring
their
son
s
educational
success
when
it
comes
to
providing
encouragement
a
safe
learning
environment
and
taking
an
active
role
in
decision making
students
may
also
face
challenges
in
managing
their
time
effectively
between
school
work
and
a
job
leading
to
life
imbalances
that
can
impede
academic
progress
additionally
family
problems
that
arise
can
easily
distract
students
from
giving
their
best
effort
in
the
classroom
for
those
without
parents
it
is
important
to
keep
your
brain
active
through
self motivation
and
dedication
while
it
may
be
difficult
to
differentiate
between
the
distractions
of
the
everyday
seeking
out
alternative
sources
of
inspiration
such
as
mentors
or
peers
can
help
spotlight
the
importance
of
knowledge
some
students
may
encounter
language
barriers
that
slow
their
academic
development
to
avoid
this
it
is
essential
to
identify
and
connect
with
appropriate
native
language
classes
or
a
tutor
to
help
expand
their
academic
vocabulary
above
all
the
importance
of
having
a
high
school
diploma
should
never
be
undermined
educational
attainment
is
a
huge
milestone
in
life
providing
the
structure
for
building
a
successful
future
each
student
should
strive
to
complete
their
high
school
education
for
the
vast
opportunities
this
yields
after
researching
various
ways
to
conserve
energy
and
resources
in
schools
i
ve
identified
several
possible
projects
and
campaigns
that
can
be
implemented
these
initiatives
include
installing
low flow
fixtures
in
sinks
and
toilets
building
student
awareness
of
energy
and
water
conservation
through
educational
campaigns
and
encouraging
campus
recycling
efforts
in
order
to
present
these
initiatives
to
the
school
board
i
would
recommend
creating
a
proposal
that
outlines
the
goals
of
each
project
and
campaign
the
benefits
of
conservation
and
a
description
of
how
each
can
be
implemented
and
maintained
the
school
board
may
also
raise
the
issue
of
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
which
could
lead
to
conflict
between
students
teachers
and
board
members
this
could
be
managed
through
a
survey
that
gauges
the
opinion
of
the
school
community
and
through
a
series
of
informational
meetings
to
discuss
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
the
proposed
extension
working
in
a
group
has
many
benefits
it
is
a
positive
step
to
take
in
any
situation
as
it
allows
for
multiple
perspectives
to
come
together
to
form
more
creative
solutions
and
achieve
greater
results
one
of
the
major
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
is
the
ability
to
collaborate
and
share
ideas
having
multiple
minds
working
on
a
project
allows
for
a
more
diverse
set
of
ideas
and
solutions
this
can
be
especially
useful
when
tackling
complex
problems
that
require
creativity
and
out
of
the
box
thinking
working
together
also
encourages
shared
responsibility
which
can
lead
to
increased
motivation
and
higher
work
productivity
another
advantage
to
working
in
a
group
is
the
ability
to
gain
insights
from
multiple
experienced
individuals
each
person
will
bring
their
own
unique
skills
talents
and
experiences
to
the
table
which
can
strengthen
the
team
s
understanding
of
the
project
as
a
whole
being
able
to
bounce
ideas
off
of
each
other
and
discuss
potential
solutions
will
ultimately
result
in
a
more
solid
plan
of
action
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
working
in
a
group
provides
many
benefits
and
should
always
be
considered
when
tackling
any
project
the
ability
to
collaborate
share
ideas
and
gain
insights
is
invaluable
and
has
the
potential
to
lead
to
more
successful
outcomes
working
independently
and
working
in
a
group
both
have
their
advantages
when
working
on
a
school
project
when
working
independently
one
has
the
opportunity
to
responsibly
manage
their
own
time
and
decide
which
tasks
need
to
be
completed
and
when
this
allows
the
individual
to
work
without
being
influenced
by
anyone
else
s
presence
or
ideas
on
the
other
hand
when
working
in
a
group
members
can
bounce
ideas
off
of
one
another
to
come
up
with
more
robust
solutions
and
develop
their
communication
and
collaboration
skills
working
in
a
group
also
provides
shared
accountability
allowing
each
member
to
feel
supported
in
completing
their
part
of
the
assignment
ultimately
the
decision
of
which
approach
to
take
on
a
school
project
depends
on
the
skills
and
preferences
of
the
individuals
involved
studying
and
gaining
new
information
and
skills
is
essential
for
future
job
prospects
attending
classes
either
in
person
or
online
can
expand
one
s
knowledge
of
the
latest
trends
in
their
respective
field
while
there
are
numerous
benefits
to
attending
classes
there
are
also
potential
challenges
students
may
face
depending
on
their
location
and
resources
available
for
instance
if
distance
is
an
issue
attending
a
physical
class
may
be
difficult
alternatively
students
with
access
to
technology
may
find
that
online
classes
provide
greater
flexibility
moreover
different
opportunities
are
available
to
students
depending
on
their
prior
educational
experience
and
skills
attained
for
example
some
may
benefit
more
from
college
courses
while
others
may
receive
greater
benefit
from
vocational
classes
in
sum
by
researching
and
understanding
the
benefits
and
challenges
of
attending
classes
a
student
can
take
advantage
of
available
educational
opportunities
to
benefit
their
future
job
prospects
an
employer
s
decision
to
hire
a
candidate
is
based
on
many
components
one
of
which
is
experience
while
having
extensive
experience
can
often
make
an
individual
a
top
pick
for
a
job
opening
employers
also
benefit
from
considering
applicants
who
have
little
to
no
experience
those
who
lack
experience
have
fewer
preconceived
notions
about
the
job
and
can
bring
fresh
perspectives
to
challenges
additionally
they
can
be
trained
more
quickly
and
cost effectively
aspiring
employees
who
have
limited
or
no
experience
can
succeed
by
demonstrating
their
hard
work
diligent
study
and
dedication
to
the
job
during
an
interview
candidates
should
highlight
their
unique
strengths
and
explain
how
their
ambition
and
eagerness
to
learn
can
be
an
advantage
moreover
having
them
focus
on
the
skills
and
characteristics
that
can
be
acquired
through
the
job
itself
can
help
potential
employers
to
accurately
assess
them
for
the
role
should
an
employer
incorrectly
judge
potential
employees
based
on
experience
alone
it
could
lead
to
hiring
the
wrong
candidate
therefore
it
is
important
for
employers
to
holistically
assess
each
candidate
s
skillset
to
determine
who
would
be
the
best
fit
for
the
job
when
it
comes
to
life
advice
it
is
always
wise
to
get
opinions
from
multiple
people
drawing
from
a
variety
of
sources
and
perspectives
provides
a
robust
set
of
ideas
to
consider
and
helps
to
ensure
that
no
stone
is
left
unturned
as
an
example
if
you
re
trying
to
make
the
important
decision
of
whether
to
go
back
to
school
and
pursue
a
new
degree
consulting
with
your
family
mentors
or
friends
can
be
helpful
in
understanding
different
angles
and
potential
outcomes
having
multiple
people
weigh
in
on
a
decision
can
provide
the
support
and
confidence
necessary
to
move
forward
hearing
different
perspectives
also
reminds
us
to
be
flexible
and
to
remain
open
to
new
possibilities
while
keeping
sight
of
our
own
personal
values
and
goals
this
is
especially
true
in
instances
when
a
single
opinion
or
valued
opinion
may
not
be
sufficient
for
example
if
you
are
planning
to
make
a
career
change
you
may
need
to
talk
to
people
who
have
successfully
gone
through
the
transition
in
order
to
recognize
potential
obstacles
and
create
a
realistic
plan
getting
advice
from
multiple
people
allows
us
to
benefit
from
everyone
s
individual
experiences
paving
the
way
to
a
knighted
path
of
informed
decisions
all
in
all
leveraging
feedback
from
multiple
sources
can
be
a
rewarding
and
incredibly
enriching
venture
on
our
life
journeys
after
careful
research
and
consideration
i
ve
decided
to
pursue
a
career
in
medicine
and
so
i
have
identified
the
specific
courses
of
study
that
i
need
to
take
in
order
to
achieve
this
goal
i
looked
into
the
career
options
available
in
my
family
and
found
that
many
of
them
had
pursued
careers
in
the
medical
field
knowing
that
i
had
a
supportive
family
network
of
individuals
who
had
achieved
success
in
this
field
i
was
motivated
to
make
this
career
choice
in
making
the
decision
to
pursue
a
career
at
a
such
a
young
age
i
have
been
able
to
maximize
my
academic
and
professional
resources
taking
the
appropriate
college
prep
courses
in
high
school
as
well
as
participating
in
career focused
internships
have
allowed
me
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
what
the
field
of
medicine
entails
i
also
recognize
the
importance
staying
focused
on
my
career
goals
during
my
time
in
high
school
setting
obtainable
academic
goals
immersing
myself
in
medical
available
opportunities
and
surrounding
myself
with
individuals
who
have
similar
aspirations
first
impressions
can
have
an
immense
effect
on
the
success
of
relationships
both
personal
and
professional
people
often
make
assumptions
based
on
first
impressions
whether
it
s
a
job
applicant
s
clothing
or
the
body
language
of
a
person
they
re
meeting
for
the
first
time
first
impressions
can
lead
to
further
conversations
that
help
foster
strong
relationships
and
lay
the
groundwork
for
successful
interactions
in
the
future
an
example
of
a
positive
first
impression
is
when
two
co workers
initially
meet
and
find
common
ground
by
sharing
an
interest
in
a
certain
hobby
or
activity
on
the
other
hand
negative
first
impressions
can
lead
to
misunderstandings
that
can
damage
relationships
before
they
even
have
the
chance
to
begin
an
example
of
a
negative
first
impression
could
be
when
two
people
are
meeting
for
the
first
time
and
one
seems
uninterested
in
what
the
other
is
saying
coming
off
as
disinterested
or
rude
while
first
impressions
may
not
always
be
accurate
they
can
have
a
lasting
impact
and
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
how
we
present
ourselves
to
others
in
order
to
create
a
positive
impression
educational
programs
are
a
great
way
for
both
young
and
old
students
to
come
together
and
learn
from
one
another
while
also
helping
each
other
this
type
of
program
is
important
in
order
to
bridge
the
gap
between
the
generations
build
understanding
and
foster
collaboration
it
also
gives
children
and
teens
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
experienced
adults
and
adults
the
chance
to
stay
informed
on
technological
developments
moreover
these
programs
give
students
a
platform
to
understand
the
different
perspectives
beliefs
and
values
of
the
older
and
younger
generations
this
type
of
program
should
benefit
students
from
primary
school
to
university
level
facilitated
co learning
settings
can
help
kids
build
connections
that
will
help
them
succeed
and
grow
in
the
long term
students
can
gain
valuable
insight
and
access
resources
from
experienced
colleagues
as
mentors
everyone
benefits
and
leaves
with
a
more
nuanced
understanding
of
the
world
and
how
generations
work
together
to
create
and
learn
despite
some
students
enthusiasm
for
a
three year
high
school
graduation
program
there
are
many
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
allowed
most
readily
apparent
are
the
limited
availability
to
attend
classes
after
school
and
the
high
stress
levels
involved
when
attempting
to
fit
a
four
year
program
into
three
years
extracurricular
activities
are
also
affected
as
students
must
choose
between
priority
activities
that
will
help
them
get
into
college
and
activities
that
better
reflect
their
interests
furthermore
a
lack
of
a
three
year
program
could
have
several
benefits
for
the
student
it
would
give
them
time
to
work
and
gain
experience
in
the
field
of
their
choice
it
would
mean
they
would
be
better
able
to
focus
on
their
studies
and
it
would
also
serve
to
prepare
them
adequately
for
higher
education
considering
these
points
it
is
clear
that
a
three year
high
school
program
is
not
appropriate
and
should
not
be
allowed
it
can
cause
stress
and
affects
extracurricular
activities
while
the
lack
of
such
a
program
could
prove
beneficial
to
many
as
people
we
all
understand
the
importance
of
making
a
good
first
impression
this
is
especially
true
in
professional
and
dating
situations
where
we
want
to
put
our
best
foot
forward
and
ensure
a
pleasant
and
successful
exchange
however
some
people
might
argue
that
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
i
disagree
with
this
statement
as
i
believe
that
first
impressions
can
be
changed
and
improved
through
thoughtful
consideration
and
action
although
making
that
initial
strong
impression
typically
takes
less
than
a
few
seconds
it
is
a
moment
that
can
influence
the
present
and
future
relationship
with
that
said
i
believe
that
first
impressions
can
be
purposefully
shifted
with
a
strong
intention
and
dedicated
effort
for
example
if
i
make
a
mistake
during
a
job
interview
i
can
take
the
time
to
apologize
explain
the
situation
in
appropriate
and
honest
detail
and
move
on
showing
how
i
have
learned
and
grown
from
the
experience
similarly
if
i
have
a
heated
argument
early
in
a
relationship
i
can
work
respectfully
and
compassionately
to
bridge
the
gap
with
the
other
person
first
impressions
can
be
improved
but
the
degree
of
difficulty
will
depend
on
both
the
mistake
and
the
situation
we
must
all
consider
our
first
impressions
carefully
recognizing
that
they
can
be
powerful
but
not
binding
through
communication
respect
and
effort
i
believe
that
the
negative
assumptions
associated
with
a
first
impression
can
be
managed
and
ultimately
overcome
having
a
five day
school
week
compared
to
a
four day
school
week
offers
several
advantages
students
have
more
flexibility
to
manage
their
time
and
responsibilities
more
efficiently
for
example
rather
than
attending
school
all
five
days
they
can
participate
in
a
part time
job
after
school
have
time
for
sports
or
extracurricular
activities
and
still
have
sufficient
time
to
complete
homework
assignments
a
five day
school
week
provides
a
more
consistent
and
predictable
scheduling
model
which
makes
it
easer
to
keep
up
with
coursework
on
the
other
hand
there
are
potential
drawbacks
to
adopting
a
four day
school
week
such
as
extended
school
days
that
could
lead
to
fatigue
and
burnout
the
shortened
school
week
may
also
cause
issues
with
childcare
and
scheduling
additionally
there
are
some
concerns
that
a
four day
school
week
may
not
provide
enough
time
for
students
to
get
the
education
they
need
in
order
to
be
successful
academically
though
first
impressions
can
tell
you
a
lot
about
a
person
they
have
the
potential
to
be
misleading
i
remember
when
i
first
met
my
best
friend
i
had
heard
rumors
that
she
was
a
wild
party
girl
so
i
expected
her
to
be
loud
and
obnoxious
when
i
met
her
however
she
was
actually
quite
shy
and
sweet
after
spending
more
time
with
her
and
getting
to
know
her
i
found
out
that
she
was
actually
more
of
a
homebody
than
a
party
person
though
first
impressions
can
heavily
influence
the
opinion
you
form
of
a
person
i
believe
that
an
opinion
can
change
as
you
get
to
know
someone
better
when
i
got
to
know
my
best
friend
better
i
was
able
to
see
her
true
personality
and
appreciate
her
kindness
and
intelligence
however
first
impressions
are
usually
hard
to
change
once
someone
forms
an
opinion
of
another
person
it
is
difficult
to
persuade
them
to
think
differently
no
matter
how
many
facts
a
person
may
be
presented
with
first
impressions
are
often
the
most
powerful
influence
gaining
attention
through
pretense
is
a
complicated
concept
it
can
often
be
seen
as
a
negative
behavior
suggesting
a
lack
of
confidence
or
even
a
sense
of
insecurity
when
someone
attempts
to
appear
as
something
they
re
not
in
order
to
draw
others
to
them
it
is
important
to
consider
how
this
relates
to
self esteem
there
may
be
a
fear
of
rejection
or
simply
a
desire
to
make
an
impression
but
ultimately
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
underlying
cause
furthermore
it
is
necessary
to
be
aware
of
double
standards
pretending
to
be
someone
you
re
not
to
gain
attention
can
be
especially
damaging
if
done
by
someone
of
a
certain
gender
or
sexual
orientation
since
those
people
often
face
greater
scrutiny
for
their
behavior
on
the
other
hand
there
is
also
something
to
be
said
for
keeping
a
small
circle
of
trusted
people
in
one
s
personal
life
feeling
comfortable
in
a
close knit
group
can
be
a
key
factor
in
avoiding
the
need
to
portray
a
false
persona
in
order
to
gain
attention
it
is
common
for
high
school
and
college
students
to
feel
uncertain
about
their
future
careers
in
fact
many
students
do
not
have
the
ability
to
commit
to
a
career
path
at
such
a
young
age
this
can
be
attributed
to
several
factors
students
are
often
still
exploring
their
interests
and
trying
to
find
their
specialties
in
order
to
decide
which
field
or
profession
to
pursue
this
process
can
take
time
and
often
involves
trying
out
a
variety
of
experiences
such
as
volunteer
work
internships
and
educational
courses
additionally
in
an
ever changing
economy
the
job
market
may
be
in
flux
which
can
make
it
difficult
to
determine
where
to
invest
time
and
resources
labour
market
research
further
evidences
this
point
according
to
the
of
statistics
most
individuals
work
an
average
of
different
jobs
throughout
their
lives
with
the
average
person
spending
almost
five
years
in
each
job
this
indicates
that
career
commitment
does
not
come
quickly
nor
easily
rather
it
is
a
process
which
takes
time
and
exploration
of
various
interests
and
potential
opportunities
moreover
young
people
are
still
developing
their
skills
values
and
interests all
of
which
can
greatly
influence
job
choice
the
of
s
transition
and
states
that
students
must
be
able
to
identify
and
explore
their
individual
career related
preferences
and
interests
before
they
can
begin
to
consider
and
make
informed
career
choices
this
further
suggests
that
young
individuals
may
not
be
sufficiently
informed
or
knowledgeable
about
a
given
field
or
profession
in
order
to
make
a
career
commitment
in
conclusion
it
is
understandable
why
so
many
students
lack
the
ability
to
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
this
is
due
to
a
combination
of
factors
ranging
from
a
still developing
skillset
to
a
changing
job
market
to
identifying
personal
interests
with
time
research
exploration
and
advisement
however
students
can
easily
develop
a
deeper
understanding
of
available
career
paths
and
come
to
an
informed
decision
confidence
is
an
important
factor
when
it
comes
to
achieving
anything whether
it
is
in
our
personal
or
professional
lives
this
raises
the
question
of
whether
having
self confidence
before
achieving
a
goal
or
experience
is
necessary
for
our
success
i
believe
that
having
self confidence
is
the
first
step
of
all
achievers
big
or
small
having
confidence
in
oneself
gives
us
the
motivation
and
drive
to
strive
for
what
we
want
in
life
even
when
the
odds
are
against
us
for
example
an
aspiring
author
may
be
confident
in
their
abilities
to
write
a
book
even
if
they
don
t
have
any
published
works
yet
they
will
be
encouraged
to
keep
going
and
stay
motivated
because
of
their
internal
belief
in
their
skills
on
the
other
hand
lacking
confidence
can
lead
to
a
negative
attitude
towards
achieving
goals
when
we
don
t
believe
in
ourselves
we
may
doubt
our
potential
and
give
up
on
our
ambitions
an
entrepreneur
may
forgo
a
promising
opportunity
out
of
fear
of
failure
because
they
lack
self confidence
this
would
lead
to
missed
opportunities
and
ultimately
leads
to
an
unfulfilled
life
in
conclusion
for
any
achievements big
or
small self confidence
is
the
key
it
is
the
all important
catalyst
that
helps
us
to
move
forward
with
our
goals
despite
the
odds
with
self confidence
we
can
stay
motivated
and
persevere
in
the
pursuit
of
our
goals
without
it
we
may
lack
the
necessary
drive
to
see
our
aspirations
through
success
and
failure
are
essential
parts
of
the
human
experience
but
how
we
confront
them
can
completely
change
the
values
that
we
take
away
from
each
famous
personalities
such
as
and
all

before
rising
to

by

excerpt
the
concept
of
self reliance
is
heavily
valued
by
many
and
is
often
seen
as
integral
to
personal
growth
and
development
it
is
important
for
those
who
value
self reliance
to
be
aware
that
seeking
guidance
from
appropriate
experts
and
authorities
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
lack
of
self reliance
but
instead
an
important
step
in
making
the
best
possible
decisions
when
it
comes
to
making
decisions
about
important
matters
in
life
we
are
often
faced
with
huge
amounts
of
options
and
uncertainty
from
selecting
courses
of
study
to
deciding
which
career
path
to
pursue
seeking
guidance
from
a
professional
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
in
helping
inform
one
s
own
decision making
professional
experts
and
authorities
have
the
experience
and
knowledge
to
provide
in depth
advice
that
may
not
be
easily
accessible
to
the
average
person
by
obtaining
further
insight
into
the
particular
circumstance
individuals
can
be
more
confident
in
their
decision
and
can
take
into
account
more
variables
before
arriving
at
a
final
decision
as
the
business
world
evolves
so
does
the
way
in
which
students
are
able
to
gain
hands on
experience
and
learn
best
practices
from
industry
professionals
through
student company
partnerships
schools
across
the
nation
are
introducing
students
to
opportunities
to
engage
with
real
businesses
and
explore
the
professional
world
with
the
help
of
technology
businesses
are
able
to
connect
with
students
in
an
efficient
and
convenient
manner
allowing
each
party
to
benefit
from
the
partnership
for
young
students
these
partnerships
can
be
extremely
valuable
providing
them
with
experience
and
insight
into
the
world
of
business
having
direct
access
to
professionals
in
the
field
can
provide
a
real world
education
which
no
traditional
classroom
can
offer
businesses
can
benefit
from
these
partnerships
as
they
can
build
potential
relationships
with
experienced
employees
who
have
already
gained
the
knowledge
and
skills
necessary
for
success
on
top
of
that
schools
are
beginning
to
offer
classes
in
entrepreneurship
and
business
which
equip
students
with
the
skills
and
knowledge
needed
to
understand
the
industry
with
students
gaining
an
advantage
from
these
classes
and
engaging
with
local
businesses
both
students
and
businesses
can
grow
and
develop
together
through
partnerships
and
business
classes
students
can
gain
valuable
experience
and
set
themselves
up
for
success
in
future
employment
conformity
can
be
a
controling
force
in
our
lives
if
we
re
not
careful
to
examine
the
repercussions
of
what
we
do
is
constantly
changing
and
evolving
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
we
want
to
reach
success
and
keep
the
people
we
love
in
our
lives
we
must
be
willing
to
go
beyond
merely
following
the
status
quo
living
within
the
boundaries
of
society
comes
with
certain
expectations
and
standards
that
may
not
align
with
our
best
interests
it
often
creates
a
false
sense
of
security
trapping
us
in
a
cycle
of
doing
what
s
expected
this
is
why
it
s
so
important
to
recognize
our
own
agency
and
not
feel
inhibited
by
the
inescapable
label
of
conformity
in
order
to
break
away
from
the
chains
of
conformity
and
realize
our
own
potential
we
should
strive
to
be
different
we
should
be
adventurous
in
our
pursuits
open minded
in
our
thoughts
and
allow
ourselves
to
explore
different
avenues
with
an
optimistic
outlook
refusing
to
limit
our
ability
to
think
act
and
experience
the
world
differently
opens
the
door
to
seizing
greater
opportunities
and
relationships
going
beyond
conformity
is
a
challenge
it
involves
taking
risks
pushing
ourselves
into
unknown
territory
and
continuously
adapting
to
unforeseen
difficulties
however
it
is
only
by
doing
this
that
we
can
break
out
of
our
bubble
and
experience
true
success
not
only
for
ourselves
but
also
for
the
people
we
care
about
one
of
the
major
advantages
to
taking
an
online
class
is
the
convenience
it
provides
to
students
they
do
n t
have
to
worry
about
commuting
to
class
each
day
or
having
their
schedules
interrupted
by
classes
furthermore
online
classes
often
allow
for
more
flexible
pacing
allowing
students
to
work
at
their
own
speed
however
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
taking
online
classes
too
the
lack
of
in person
interaction
with
a
teacher
and
other
students
can
lead
to
feelings
of
isolation
also
traditional
classroom
settings
usually
provide
a
structure
and
organization
that
can
be
more
difficult
to
achieve
in
an
online
class
technical
issues
such
as
internet
connection
and
compatibility
with
the
courseware
can
cause
frustration
for
students
as
well
to
address
these
issues
online
courses
should
provide
a
robust
discussion
forum
and
interactive
elements
such
as
live
video
sessions
or
quizzes
it
s
also
important
for
teachers
to
remain
available
to
answer
students
questions
and
provide
assistance
when
needed
in
conclusion
while
online
classes
offer
many
advantages
there
are
some
potential
problems
that
can
be
avoided
or
minimized
with
the
right
planning
and
implementation
with
the
right
support
structures
in
place
online
courses
can
be
a
valid
and
successful
educational
option
for
students
attending
classes
at
school
provides
unique
advantages
not
available
through
online
classes
for
example
attending
school
provides
students
with
face to face
communication
with
their
peers
and
instructors
additionally
a
physical
campus
allows
for
collaboration
between
students
in
groups
which
can
be
difficult
to
replicate
online
on
the
other
hand
taking
classes
online
has
its
own
advantages
it
allows
students
to
learn
from
any
location
providing
a
greater
degree
of
flexibility
than
attending
classes
in
person
moreover
online
classes
might
be
more
accessible
in
terms
of
price
and
having
higher
technology related
requirements
in
order
for
the
student
to
attend
their
classes
if
everyone
took
classes
online
schools
would
face
the
challenge
of
fewer
students
attending
this
could
lead
to
fewer
resources
available
for
students
a
possibly
reduced
class
selection
and
the
disruption
of
field
trips
and
extracurriculars
due
to
lack
of
participation
ultimately
this
could
lead
to
decreased
school
spirit
and
a
feeling
of
disconnect
from
the
school
community
overall
research
indicates
that
pairing
older
students
with
younger
students
through
school
programs
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
both
parties
regardless
of
age
studies
conducted
suggest
that
younger
students
are
more
likely
to
excel
academically
when
working
and
collaborating
with
older
peers
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
older
students
tend
to
have
more
advanced
knowledge
in
the
given
subject
as
well
as
more
experience
and
skills
working
in
a
team
older
students
on
the
other
hand
benefit
from
enrolling
in
peer mentoring
programs
by
gaining
more
responsibility
and
increasing
their
social
skills
the
positive
reinforcement
from
teaching
younger
students
can
be
an
invaluable
experience
for
older
students
resulting
in
increased
self satisfaction
and
confidence
overall
school
programs
that
pair
different
age
groups
have
numerous
benefits
for
both
younger
and
older
students
providing
them
with
invaluable
knowledge
and
allowing
them
to
gain
key
interpersonal
skills
the
pandemic
has
caused
many
students
to
transition
to
learning
from
home
through
online
or
video
conferencing
although
this
is
a
revolutionary
move
towards
modern
education
students
may
not
benefit
from
learning
remotely
in
fact
students
learning
from
home
can
face
many
potential
challenges
without
access
to
a
physical
classroom
students
lack
the
personalized
support
they
need
while
teachers
may
still
be
available
for
assistance
digital
communication
lacks
the
same
level
of
discussion
as
face to face
instruction
additionally
there
is
no
real
opportunity
for
students
to
voice
their
opinions
and
engage
in
interactive
learning
which
is
essential
for
growth
learning
from
home
can
be
difficult
for
some
students
since
there
is
no
one
monitoring
their
progress
many
may
struggle
to
focus
students
may
become
distracted
by
technology
video
games
friends
and
family
and
other
out of school
activities
this
results
in
a
lack
of
progress
in
classes
and
can
set
students
back
in
terms
of
learning
lastly
at home
learning
can
lead
to
a
loss
in
general
knowledge
and
awareness
of
the
world
around
them
schools
can
provide
valuable
life
experiences
and
necessary
social
interaction
that
help
prepare
students
for
life
beyond
the
classroom
without
physical
classes
students
miss
out
on
these
experiences
leaving
them
ill equipped
for
the
world
at
large
in
conclusion
home
learning
has
potential
advantages
such
as
convenience
and
accessibility
however
these
benefits
may
come
at
the
cost
of
personal
support
focus
and
awareness
without
face to face
instruction
in
the
classroom
students
may
not
have
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
in
the
modern
technological
world
it
is
hard
to
ignore
the
potentially
negative
impact
that
technology
has
had
on
our
lives
while
technology
has
revolutionized
how
we
live
the
side
effects
can
not
be
overlooked
one
such
side
effect
is
that
people
are
slowly
losing
their
ability
to
think
for
themselves
the
exponential
growth
of
technology
over
the
past
decade
has
meant
that
technology
is
now
everywhere
instead
of
relying
on
our
own
problem solving
abilities
we
are
increasingly
relying
on
technology
to
do
things
for
us
as
an
example
the
many
online
banking
sites
and
financial
calculators
available
have
become
the
norm
as
opposed
to
manually
calculating
and
budgeting
ourselves
this
has
led
to
many
people
becoming
dependent
on
technology
as
a
mental
crutch
and
caused
us
to
lose
our
ability
to
think
independently
another
way
that
technology
has
negatively
impacted
our
lives
is
how
it
has
become
both
an
addiction
and
a
distraction
with
the
ability
to
access
the
internet
and
social
media
from
wherever
we
are
a
large
portion
of
our
days
are
now
spent
aimlessly
browsing
this
addiction
has
significantly
reduced
the
amount
of
time
that
we
are
spending
thinking
and
reasoning
for
ourselves
has
undoubtedly
become
an
integral
part
of
our
way
of
life
however
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
negative
effects
that
it
can
have
as
this
may
lead
to
us
losing
the
ability
to
think
for
ourselves
and
be
self reliant
if
we
are
not
careful
our
current
generation
and
future
generations
may
suffer
because
of
it
one
of
the
biggest
struggles
adolescents
face
is
the
feeling
of
being
overwhelmed
by
their
environment
and
the
pressures
placed
upon
them
with
so
many
demands
placed
on
young
people
it
can
be
difficult
to
know
how
to
make
their
own
decisions
however
despite
these
external
influences
the
power
to
decide
one
s
own
future
and
path
remains
within
each
person
s
control
take
for
example
the
story
of
a
high
school
freshman
who
felt
pressured
to
pursue
a
career
in
medicine
like
many
of
her
peers
despite
this
followed
her
true
passions
and
decided
to
major
in
music
instead
while
she
was
aware
that
this
could
be
a
risky
endeavor
chose
to
take
a
leap
and
make
the
decision
that
was
right
for
her
through
her
strength
and
courage
followed
her
own
path
and
ultimately
created
the
future
she
wanted
for
herself
these
types
of
stories
are
reminders
that
we
all
have
the
ability
to
control
our
own
lives
while
we
can
not
always
change
our
environment
or
the
people
around
us
the
power
of
decision
is
in
our
own
hands
no
matter
what
outside
influences
come
our
way
it
is
ultimately
our
responsibility
to
make
decisions
that
will
help
shape
the
future
we
want
technology
has
been
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
when
it
comes
to
humans
on
one
hand
it
has
allowed
us
to
be
more
connected
than
ever
before
with
people
around
the
world
able
to
communicate
quickly
and
easily
it
has
also
enabled
us
to
access
vast
amounts
of
knowledge
with
just
a
few
clicks
of
the
mouse
in
many
ways
technology
has
made
our
lives
easier
and
more
convenient
on
the
other
hand
technology
has
had
some
negative
consequences
studies
have
shown
that
too
much
time
spent
using
technology
can
have
a
serious
impact
on
our
mental
and
physical
health
for
example
being
constantly
exposed
to
screens
can
lead
to
eye
strain
headaches
fatigue
and
poor
posture
some
technologies
have
caused
problems
such
as
cyberbullying
and
data
breaches
resulting
in
safety
and
security
risks
ultimately
the
key
to
avoiding
the
potential
negative
effects
of
technology
on
humans
is
to
use
it
in
moderation
by
limiting
how
much
time
we
spend
using
these
devices
we
can
reap
the
benefits
of
being
connected
without
sacrificing
our
health
or
security
the
key
to
effectively
changing
one
s
first
impression
is
to
have
a
deep
understanding
of
the
power
of
cognitive
ability
a
person
s
mental
capacity
for
managing
the
impressions
they
make
on
other
people
is
known
as
and
is
a
skill
that
can
be
utilized
to
craft
meaningful
conversations
that
are
designed
to
leave
a
strong
positive
lasting
impression
management
techniques
such
as
being
mindful
of
body
language
and
eye
contact
speaking
slowly
and
confidently
and
being
genuinely
interested
in
what
your
conversation
partner
has
to
say
can
all
contribute
to
making
a
positive
impression
additionally
being
able
to
pause
reflect
and
respond
thoughtfully
to
questions
or
comments
can
make
others
perceive
you
as
well informed
and
level headed
with
the
right
strategies
in
place
you
can
turn
any
initial
negative
impression
into
a
lasting
more
positive
one
spending
time
together
and
engaging
in
activities
that
both
parties
enjoy
is
invaluable
in
developing
strong
and
long lasting
relationships
sharing
new
experiences
can
help
to
create
a
lasting
bond
and
create
perceptions
and
attitudes
in
one
another
that
can
last
over
time
when
first
impressions
form
it
can
be
important
to
understand
how
the
other
person
is
feeling
and
in
turn
take
a
moment
to
reflect
on
how
they
come
across
in
a
new
situation
too
doing
this
can
help
to
form
a
closer
connection
and
can
give
both
individuals
the
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
one
another
when
it
comes
tocharting
a
successful
path
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
important
tools
you
can
possess
has
shown
that
the
power
of
positivity
can
help
propel
a
person
towards
their
goals
and
allow
them
to
lead
a
happier
and
more
meaningful
life
having
a
positive
outlook
not
only
helps
increase
motivation
but
it
can
also
help
us
to
handle
difficult
situations
more
effectively
and
look
for
solutions
rather
than
dwell
on
the
negatives
on
the
other
hand
not
having
a
positive
attitude
can
cause
us
to
doubt
ourselves
become
discouraged
more
easily
and
limit
our
capacity
to
see
solutions
therefore
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
indicators
of
a
negative
attitude
such
as
feeling
discouraged
or
pessimistic
and
develop
strategies
to
reverse
it
examples
of
how
a
positive
attitude
can
be
beneficial
in
difficult
situations
include
learning
how
to
stay
calm
looking
for
opportunities
in
adversity
and
using
positive
language
additionally
in
order
to
achieve
goals
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
overall
goal
rather
than
on
small
failures
along
the
way
and
to
maintain
a
mindset
that
is
open
to
learning
and
is
driven
by
enthusiasm
with
a
positive
attitude
and
continued
dedication
many
seemingly
impossible
goals
can
be
achieved
one
potential
benefit
of
a
year
high
school
program
is
that
it
allows
students
to
complete
their
high
school
education
at
a
faster
pace
this
would
allow
students
to
finish
their
education
by
the
age
of
instead
of
having
to
wait
until
they
are
or
years
old
additionally
the
courses
offered
through
a
year
program
are
typically
more
rigorous
so
students
that
graduate
from
these
programs
are
more
prepared
for
college
or
post secondary
institutions
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
drawbacks
to
enrolling
in
a
year
accelerated
program
for
example
some
students
may
find
it
too
challenging
to
keep
up
with
the
workload
or
may
find
their
social
life
suffering
due
to
the
added
hours
spent
studying
additionally
due
to
the
accelerated
nature
of
the
program
the
dropout
rate
may
be
higher
than
for
traditional
year
programs
in
my
opinion
year
high
school
programs
can
be
beneficial
for
certain
students
particularly
those
who
are
highly
motivated
and
are
confident
they
can
handle
the
increased
workload
however
these
programs
may
not
be
suitable
for
students
who
may
struggle
with
the
extra
pressure
or
need
the
extra
time
to
develop
both
academically
and
socially
self reliance
is
defined
as
the
ability
to
rely
on
one
s
own
resources
and
decisions
rather
than
relying
on
someone
else
for
advice
or
help
being
self reliant
has
many
benefits
which
well summarized
in
his
quote
i
can
accept
failure
everyone
fails
at
something
but
i
ca
n t
accept
not
trying
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
important
in
order
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
become
self aware
and
make
mindful
choices
there
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
relying
on
someone
else
for
advice
while
it
may
help
to
receive
input
from
those
who
have
more
experience
it
is
ultimately
best
to
make
decisions
based
on
one
s
own
intuition
and
knowledge
in
order
to
take
control
of
one
s
own
life
being
self reliant
is
an
invaluable
skill
to
possess
as
it
allows
an
individual
to
make
mindful
decisions
and
develop
trust
in
their
own
decision making
capabilities
being
honest
in
relationships
and
in
the
real
world
is
an
important
part
of
living
a
healthy
fulfilling
life
although
it
can
sometimes
be
difficult
to
tell
the
truth
it
ultimately
strengthens
relationships
builds
trust
and
promotes
better
communication
leads
to
greater
transparency
between
two
people
and
allows
them
to
better
understand
one
another
on
the
other
hand
dishonesty
can
have
devastating
effects
on
relationships
it
can
lead
to
hurt
feelings
a
lack
of
trust
and
even
the
ending
of
a
relationship
people
lie
for
various
reasons
but
in
the
end
dishonesty
rarely
serves
the
interests
of
the
one
lying
it
breeds
suspicion
and
can
cause
significant
damage
to
a
relationship
in
the
real
world
dishonesty
can
have
serious
consequences
ranging
from
minor
penalties
to
criminal
charges
it
is
ultimately
in
our
best
interests
to
be
honest
in
our
dealings
with
people
in
order
to
build
credibility
and
goodwill
being
honest
also
helps
us
to
avoid
unnecessary
complications
and
helps
foster
a
positive
image
of
ourselves
learning
has
revolutionized
the
way
people
learn
in
the
modern
world
despite
the
availability
of
advantages
there
are
also
numerous
disadvantages
that
should
be
considered
when
enrolling
in
an
online
learning
program
one
disadvantage
of
online
learning
stems
from
the
lack
of
in person
interaction
with
instructors
this
can
be
difficult
for
students
who
need
personal
guidance
from
a
teacher
to
understand
complicated
concepts
additionally
when
learning
online
students
may
find
it
more
difficult
to
stay
focused
on
the
task
at
hand
the
distractions
of
home
such
as
pets
family
or
the
can
make
it
hard
to
concentrate
and
achieve
the
same
level
of
understanding
that
in person
learning
might
provide
another
drawback
of
online
learning
is
the
potential
for
technical
issues
in
an
online
course
technology
is
vital
to
allow
for
navigation
of
course
materials
assignments
testing
and
communication
with
instructors
and
other
students
without
access
to
a
reliable
internet
connection
or
even
a
laptop
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
complete
their
work
in
a
timely
manner
additionally
software
or
unanticipated
technical
problems
can
prevent
students
from
accessing
their
materials
leading
to
difficulties
in
completing
coursework
despite
these
disadvantages
there
are
many
benefits
to
online
learning
online
courses
can
provide
flexibility
to
accommodate
students
schedules
allowing
them
to
work
around
jobs
family
commitments
or
any
other
conflicts
it
is
also
possible
for
students
to
pursue
courses
that
may
not
be
offered
in
the
traditional
college
setting
by
accessing
classes
from
different
college
or
universities
around
the
world
additionally
online
learning
programs
are
often
more
affordable
than
traditional
on campus
courses
in
conclusion
online
learning
offers
a
range
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
when
considering
online
coursework
students
should
weigh
both
the
positives
and
negatives
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
on
the
best
learning
option
for
their
particular
situation
learning
provides
students
with
many
benefits
compared
to
traditional
classes
one
key
advantage
is
that
students
can
attend
classes
on
their
own
time
with
distance
learning
no
matter
where
a
student
is
or
when
they
are
available
they
can
attend
and
complete
their
courses
this
makes
it
easier
for
students
who
for
various
reasons
can
not
attend
physical
classes
on
time
or
who
are
unable
to
attend
every
day
also
when
a
student
opts
for
distance
learning
they
can
attend
classes
from
anywhere
no
longer
do
students
have
to
be
cooped
up
in
a
traditional
classroom
now
they
can
choose
to
study
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
or
even
from
a
cafe
or
library
in
their
hometown
this
makes
learning
more
convenient
and
accessible
to
a
variety
of
students
graduating
high
school
early
in
three
or
four
years
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
one
hand
graduating
early
allows
students
to
save
on
the
cost
of
tuition
that
would
have
been
used
in
the
remaining
year
or
two
of
high
school
this
expedited
education
can
potentially
also
offer
educational
benefits
such
as
providing
extra
time
to
pursue
college
courses
or
internships
to
gain
valuable
experience
additionally
students
may
benefit
from
social
connections
since
they
will
not
need
to
separate
from
their
current
circle
of
friends
and
family
members
on
the
other
hand
graduating
early
may
have
disadvantages
for
example
students
may
miss
out
on
important
educational
experiences
such
as
opportunities
to
learn
from
teachers
or
classmates
in
the
later
years
of
high
school
furthermore
there
may
be
financial
costs
associated
with
the
accelerated
pace
of
education
such
as
the
cost
of
college
courses
additionally
it
may
be
difficult
to
adjust
quickly
to
the
transition
into
college
and
students
may
thus
miss
out
on
the
academic
preparation
they
would
have
gained
if
they
had
taken
the
time
to
thoroughly
complete
high
school
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
we
started
a
new
program
of
student
exchange
older
and
younger
students
were
paired
together
to
foster
a
sense
of
learning
and
camaraderie
the
older
students
helped
the
younger
ones
understand
new
concepts
while
the
younger
students
offered
assistance
to
the
older
students
with
topics
that
may
have
been
forgotten
since
elementary
school
every
week
they
would
bond
over
their
shared
stories
and
childhood
experiences
and
learn
from
each
other
s
unique
perspectives
in
the
end
both
participants
found
that
they
had
improved
their
skills
and
put
in
better
grades
in
the
longer
run
is
an
important
trait
that
can
help
people
discover
and
achieve
great
success
in
life
it
encourages
consideration
of
different
perspectives
and
allows
people
to
find
solutions
to
seemingly
impossible
problems
by
expressing
their
unique
ideas
and
taking
independent
action
individuals
can
become
visionaries
and
drive
positive
change
for
example
visionary
scientists
have
pushed
the
boundaries
of
understanding
and
have
discovered
groundbreaking
theories
that
sparked
important
advancements
in
science
and
medicine
for
example
was
a
trailblazer
in
astronomy
who
challenged
convention
and
introduced
new
theories
regarding
the
motion
of
planets
in
our
solar
system
similarly
showed
tremendous
courage
and
independence
in
her
work
with
radiation
making
revolutionary
discoveries
in
the
field
that
continue
to
impact
our
lives
today
these
inspiring
stories
demonstrate
how
important
individuality
is
not
only
does
it
inspire
risk taking
and
creative
problem solving
but
also
encourages
people
to
think
outside
the
box
is
a
key
factor
in
helping
people
achieve
their
goals
and
ultimately
make
a
positive
difference
in
the
world
in
conclusion
individuality
is
critical
in
allowing
people
to
explore
different
paths
and
express
their
unique
perspectives
it
gives
people
the
opportunity
to
become
visionaries
and
drive
innovative
advancements
in
different
fields
which
can
benefit
society
as
a
whole
by
embracing
individualism
and
exercising
independent
thought
people
can
find
unlocked
potential
within
themselves
and
reach
great
heights
of
accomplishments
in
recent
years
the
prevalence
of
online
and
video
conferencing
courses
have
become
increasingly
popular
as
an
alternative
to
in person
learning
while
there
are
many
advantages
to
online
and
video
learning
there
remain
several
barriers
faced
by
those
who
are
unable
to
attend
a
traditional
school
schedule
is
an
important
factor
to
take
into
consideration
as
some
can
benefit
more
from
online
classes
due
to
being
able
to
plan
their
day
around
them
additionally
the
underlying
causes
of
why
students
do
n t
finish
their
studies
is
a
crucial
element
to
understand
education
programs
could
be
beneficial
in
such
cases
as
they
can
provide
more
flexibility
and
learning
avenues
than
standard
schooling
systems
ultimately
online
and
video
conferencing
courses
present
a
great
opportunity
for
anyone
looking
for
an
alternative
to
traditional
education
which
can
be
beneficial
in
various
ways
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
can
be
an
attractive
option
for
certain
students
looking
to
jumpstart
their
education
or
careers
it
may
allow
them
to
enter
the
workforce
earlier
potentially
providing
more
job
prospects
or
enhancing
the
ability
to
get
into
top
colleges
however
completing
high
school
in
such
a
short
period
of
time
also
has
its
drawbacks
there
are
various
challenges
to
consider
such
as
having
to
forego
certain
extracurricular
activities
and
making
sure
the
necessary
academic
criteria
is
met
for
example
a
student
who
wishes
to
graduate
early
may
need
to
double
up
on
certain
classes
or
even
sacrifice
certain
electives
this
could
limit
their
exposure
to
different
fields
of
study
and
potentially
reduce
their
future
college
options
furthermore
the
intense
workload
demanded
by
an
accelerated
graduation
schedule
can
lead
to
greater
levels
of
stress
which
can
take
its
toll
on
a
student
both
mentally
and
physically
overall
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
can
be
beneficial
in
a
variety
of
ways
but
it
s
important
to
weigh
all
the
necessary
requirements
and
possible
drawbacks
it
can
be
a
great
option
for
some
students
but
it
s
important
to
consider
the
long term
effects
that
it
could
have
on
their
studies
and
future
career
the
world
is
in
dire
need
of
renewable
energy
sources
renewable
energy
can
help
reduce
emissions
and
tackle
global
warming
with
solar
wind
hydro
geothermal
and
biomass
energy
it
is
possible
to
phase
out
fossil
fuels
entirely
and
become
completely
dependent
on
renewable
energy
for
electricity
and
transportation
one
major
argument
in
favor
of
renewable
energy
stems
from
its
clean
energy
production
fuels
create
polluting
by products
that
damage
the
environment
and
human
health
but
renewable
energy
produces
no
such
pollution
solar
power
for
instance
produces
no
emissions
and
its
use
in
electric
power
plants
doesn
t
require
water
for
cooling
this
is
critical
because
many
areas
of
the
world
are
experiencing
water
shortages
energy
is
also
an
extremely
clean
source
of
energy
and
both
solar
and
wind
energy
have
much
lower
carbon
footprints
than
fossil
fuels
in
addition
to
being
clean
renewable
energy
sources
are
also
affordable
and
have
become
increasingly
so
solar
energy
is
now
about
as
cheap
as
energy
from
fossil
fuels
and
in
some
parts
of
the
world
it
is
even
cheaper
power
is
also
much
cheaper
than
solar
power
and
is
now
competitive
with
natural
gas
by
investing
in
renewable
energy
sources
governments
and
businesses
can
reduce
their
energy
costs
in
the
long
run
finally
renewable
energy
sources
offer
numerous
economic
social
and
environmental
benefits
for
instance
renewable
energy
is
often
distributed
or
generated
at
the
point
of
use
creating
jobs
in
rural
and
less
developed
areas
it
can
also
help
countries
increase
their
energy
security
because
they
don
t
rely
on
foreign
energy
sources
so
much
on
the
environmental
side
renewable
energy
sources
help
mitigate
climate
change
reduce
air
pollution
and
decrease
the
extraction
of
finite
fossil
fuels
like
coal
and
oil
in
conclusion
renewable
energy
sources
are
clean
affordable
and
offer
numerous
economic
social
and
environmental
benefits
for
these
reasons
it
should
be
the
priority
of
governments
and
businesses
to
invest
in
renewable
energy
sources
in
order
to
reduce
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
and
create
more
sustainable
forms
of
energy
caring
for
someone
with
mental
health
issues
can
be
a
huge
challenge
therefore
it
is
important
to
understand
the
symptoms
and
the
support
needed
to
help
navigate
the
day to day
realities
of
living
with
mental
health
issues
as
a
carer
you
should
be
aware
that
mental
health
can
fluctuate
from
good
to
bad
days
and
you
may
have
to
adjust
your
approach
accordingly
it
is
important
to
be
patient
and
actively
listen
as
listening
to
the
person
you
are
caring
for
is
one
of
the
most
important
elements
of
care
additionally
have
a
good
understanding
of
available
resources
and
treatment
options
such
as
therapy
medication
self help
techniques
and
other
forms
of
support
it
is
also
important
to
take
care
of
yourself
caring
for
someone
with
mental
illness
can
be
emotionally
and
physically
demanding
it
is
essential
to
practice
self care
this
can
include
engaging
in
activities
you
enjoy
or
reaching
out
to
your
support
network
finally
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
any
signs
of
burnout
and
reach
out
to
professional
help
and
support
if
necessary
caring
for
someone
with
mental
health
issues
is
an
incredibly
rewarding
yet
challenging
journey
it
is
important
to
stay
informed
patient
and
have
the
courage
to
seek
help
when
needed
is
one
of
many
individuals
who
have
taken
up
the
vital
role
of
soldier
in
recent
years
thanks
to
its
advancement
of
financial
security
and
protection
of
lives
displaying
courage
and
heroism
while
defending
their
homeland
s
story
is
just
one
of
many
that
show
why
being
a
soldier
is
a
job
worth
considering
for
those
who
wish
to
protect
others
from
stories
of
independent
service
members
using
their
skills
to
help
in
the
aftermath
of
natural
disasters
to
those
who
volunteer
to
serve
in
war
zones
evidence
of
the
positive
work
soldiers
do
is
abundant
yet
there
are
still
challenges
associated
with
the
role
for
women
despite
equality
between
genders
being
an
increasingly
important
problem
our
society
faces
women
are
still
facing
numerous
obstacles
in
becoming
soldiers
from
the
gender
pay
gap
to
the
risky
lack
of
representation
in
leadership
positions
acceptance
of
the
idea
that
women
can
make
a
positive
contribution
to
the
military
is
still
a
growing
process
and
s
service
continues
to
be
a
powerful
demonstration
of
the
strength
care
and
respect
women
can
bring
to
the
profession
ultimately
the
military
is
an
excellent
job
opportunity
for
those
looking
to
make
an
income
and
make
a
positive
difference
in
the
lives
of
people
in
need
of
protection
imagination
can
be
an
incredibly
powerful
tool
for
achieving
success
it
enables
us
to
go
beyond
our
known
boundaries
and
explore
possibilities
that
we
had
not
considered
before
imagination
allows
us
to
dream
devise
plans
and
think
outside
the
box
in
short
it
gives
us
the
confidence
and
motivation
to
try
something
new
and
make
it
happen
take
the
example
of
who
envisioned
a
world
in
which
electric
cars
become
the
norm
and
space
exploration
was
feasible
for
everyone
through
his
imagination
he
was
driven
to
build
the
electric
car
company
and
his
successful
vision
was
made
possible
by
his
ingenious
imagination
rather
than
sheer
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
knowledge
is
important
in
the
process
of
achieving
success
however
without
imagination
it
is
unlikely
that
this
knowledge
can
be
leveraged
effectively
without
creativity
and
imagination
is
like
driving
a
car
without
a
destination
it
s
essential
to
understand
the
science
behind
what
we
are
creating
but
without
creative
ideas
to
guide
us
all
the
knowledge
in
the
world
is
useless
in
summary
imagination
is
just
as
important
as
knowledge
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
it
gives
us
the
confidence
and
motivation
to
try
something
new
explore
uncharted
territory
and
extend
the
boundaries
of
what
is
possible
without
imagination
knowledge
alone
can
not
be
leveraged
effectively
to
manifest
the
desired
dreams
and
ambitions
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
achieving
success
in
life
it
is
often
said
that
attitude
is
everything
and
this
is
especially
true
when
it
comes
to
succeeding
in
life
a
positive
attitude
can
help
a
person
overcome
obstacles
and
keep
going
towards
their
goals
it
gives
a
person
the
motivation
and
resilience
to
face
challenges
and
setbacks
without
getting
discouraged
or
giving
up
it
also
helps
to
keep
oneself
motivated
and
inspired
to
keep
striving
to
achieve
success
in
life
a
positive
attitude
also
helps
to
create
a
more
positive
outlook
on
life
overall
it
allows
a
person
to
appreciate
and
be
grateful
for
good
things
in
life
even
in
the
midst
of
struggles
or
difficulties
having
this
kind
of
outlook
means
that
a
person
is
more
likely
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
that
come
their
way
and
to
have
a
more
productive
attitude
when
dealing
with
difficult
situations
moreover
having
a
positive
attitude
can
also
add
meaning
and
purpose
to
life
knowing
that
one
is
working
towards
something
and
that
they
can
achieve
it
no
matter
what
the
odds
might
be
gives
a
person
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
fulfillment
that
can
make
a
huge
difference
to
their
overall
wellbeing
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
achieving
success
in
life
it
is
the
key
to
staying
motivated
when
the
going
gets
tough
as
well
as
to
enjoying
the
good
times
and
finding
purpose
in
life
truly
is
everything
when
it
comes
to
success
and
so
cultivating
a
positive
outlook
on
life
is
essential
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
acting
on
tasks
instead
of
waiting
or
doing
nothing
are
two
key
elements
that
play
an
important
role
this
is
why
it
is
essential
to
be
willing
to
take
action
and
not
wait
for
opportunities
to
come
our
way
by
researching
the
stories
of
successful
entrepreneurs
it
is
possible
to
identify
the
common
characteristics
that
each
of
them
have
in
common
for
instance
multiple
entrepreneurs
have
emphasized
the
importance
of
hard
work
taking
risks
determination
and
continuously
striving
to
improve
by
looking
at
the
stories
of
two
successful
entrepreneurs
as
examples
it
is
possible
to
recognize
that
these
two
entrepreneurs
also
share
similar
traits
the
co founder
of
was
a
great
example
of
someone
who
was
determined
and
willing
to
take
risks
he
trusted
his
instincts
and
made
the
decision
to
leave
the
comfort
of
university
and
pursue
his
creative
ideas
with
this
decision
enabled
him
to
become
one
of
the
most
successful
entrepreneurs
in
the
world
similarly
founder
of
is
also
a
perfect
example
of
someone
who
was
not
afraid
to
take
chances
in
order
to
turn
his
dreams
into
reality
he
founded
multiple
companies
of
his
ranging
from
to
from
the
stories
of
entrepreneurs
like
and
it
is
possible
to
identify
various
traits
that
they
both
share
such
as
a
sense
of
determination
a
willingness
to
take
risks
and
most
importantly
having
the
courage
to
act
on
tasks
instead
of
waiting
or
doing
nothing
therefore
it
is
important

that
it

excerpt
the
idea
of
implementing
a
four day
school
week
has
been
gaining
traction
recently
as
a
unique
way
to
save
money
and
improve
students
performance
while
there
are
certainly
pros
and
cons
to
this
idea
it
s
important
to
consider
the
practicality
of
this
idea
from
the
perspectives
of
the
student
parent
and
administration
pros
of
a
four day
school
week
include
having
more
time
for
students
to
focus
on
extracurricular
activities
reduced
stress
by
having
a
longer
weekend
and
less
overall
cost
for
the
school
district
include
increased
difficulty
for
parents
to
find
childcare
during
the
extended
school
day
potential
loss
of
lessons
due
to
compressed
school
days
and
difficulty
for
students
to
keep
up
with
amount
of
content
presented
in
less
time
overall
a
four day
school
week
is
an
intriguing
possibility
but
the
implications
should
be
considered
from
multiple
angles
before
making
a
final
decision
making
a
good
first
impression
is
incredibly
important
for
many
aspects
of
life
people
are
often
judged
by
those
around
them
on
first
impression
and
those
impressions
are
lasting
it
is
not
possible
to
go
back
in
time
and
change
a
bad
first
impression
therefore
it
is
critical
that
people
make
sure
to
leave
a
positive
and
lasting
impression
the
first
time
around
not
creating
a
successful
first
impression
can
mean
losing
important
opportunities
in
life
for
example
let
s
say
an
individual
is
meeting
a
potential
business
partner
or
investor
for
the
first
time
if
that
person
neglects
to
dress
for
the
occasion
appearing
unprofessional
and
unprepared
that
could
be
a
deal
breaker
in
terms
of
convincing
the
other
person
to
invest
in
the
business
not
appearing
to
be
someone
of
value
and
positive
standing
can
quickly
result
in
the
loss
of
a
lucrative
opportunity
not
only
does
a
bad
first
impression
lead
to
missed
opportunity
but
it
can
also
lead
to
getting
into
serious
trouble
let
s
say
someone
makes
a
first
impression
of
being
lazy
and
uninterested
in
a
job
that
could
be
grounds
for
termination
if
the
person
is
not
able
to
make
a
sufficient
case
for
themselves
in
the
future
people
need
to
be
aware
that
bad
first
impressions
can
have
serious
consequences
even
if
they
think
they
can
work
their
way
out
of
the
initial
poor
opinion
later
in
conclusion
making
a
good
first
impression
is
essential
people
can
not
go
back
and
change
a
poor
first
impression
so
it
is
key
to
make
sure
to
leave
a
strong
and
positive
one
the
first
time
neglecting
to
create
a
successful
first
impression
can
lead
to
major
missed
opportunities
or
even
worse
trouble
further
down
the
line
after
school
programs
are
an
effective
way
to
help
students
succeed
in
school
and
pull
up
their
grades
students
get
extra
academic
help
to
understand
lessons
better
and
after
school
tutoring
also
provides
a
quiet
space
to
complete
any
missing
work
this
additional
learning
environment
gives
students
more
time
to
ask
questions
foster
relationships
with
teachers
and
staff
and
build
the
skills
needed
for
academic
success
spending
time
with
adults
who
provide
guidance
supports
a
student
s
social
and
emotional
health
which
can
lead
to
improved
academic
performance
no
matter
the
situation
hard
work
and
dedication
can
help
you
achieve
the
goals
you
set
for
yourself
many
successful
people
have
started
out
with
seemingly
limited
resources
yet
their
relentless
determination
and
ambition
led
them
to
reach
great
heights
take
for
instance
she
was
a
single
mother
living
off
of
welfare
when
she
began
writing
the
series
only
for
it
to
become
one
of
the
highest grossing
franchises
in
history
the
same
is
true
for
other
areas
of
success
if
you
put
in
the
effort
to
prepare
yourself
you
open
yourself
up
to
numerous
opportunities
you
may
be
able
to
land
a
good
job
buy
a
new
car
and
even
get
your
own
house
all
of
these
accomplishments
require
dedication
as
well
as
a
willingness
to
push
yourself
further
looking
at
the
people
you
know
who
have
already
achieved
their
dreams
can
provide
some
insight
into
what
success
requires
and
what
it
takes
to
reach
your
goals
whenever
you
re
feeling
down
or
struggling
to
stay
on
track
remember
that
hard
work
can
give
you
the
life
you
desire
research
planning
ahead
and
staying
motivated
are
all
important
steps
for
increasing
the
chances
of
success
and
getting
closer
to
achieving
your
goals
research
has
shown
that
offering
career specific
courses
in
high
school
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
for
students
futures
such
courses
can
provide
them
with
an
opportunity
to
explore
various
career
paths
while
they
are
still
in
high
school
giving
them
the
ability
to
make
better
informed
decisions
and
career
decisions
in
light
of
their
individual
passions
and
skill
sets
furthermore
offering
such
courses
can
also
equip
students
with
the
essential
skills
necessary
for
success
in
their
future
profession
such
as
communication
collaboration
and
problem solving
nevertheless
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
having
career
courses
in
high
school
for
one
career
courses
may
not
always
fit
into
the
overall
curriculum
within
a
school
system
additionally
not
all
students
may
be
able
to
access
these
courses
due
to
financial
or
other
constraints
finally
career
courses
may
prove
to
be
overly
specialized
or
restrict
students
exploration
of
different
paths
thus
leaving
some
students
unprepared
for
future
opportunities
that
may
arise
with
the
ever present
technology
in
our
lives
it
has
become
increasingly
important
to
understand
how
technology
affects
our
learning
this
includes
studying
the
impact
of
students
using
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
has
demonstrated
that
allowing
students
to
bring
their
phones
into
the
classroom
may
be
harmful
to
their
learning
experience
and
could
lead
to
safety
risks
for
students
but
there
are
potential
educational
benefits
to
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
that
may
outweigh
these
risks
it
is
also
worthwhile
to
examine
laws
and
regulations
in
other
countries
about
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
may
need
to
take
preventative
measures
to
protect
against
inappropriate
use
of
phones
and
ensure
that
technology
in
the
classroom
is
being
used
for
educational
purposes
roaming
the
cobblestones
of
is
like
entering
a
world
of
history
and
culture
the
language
a
blend
of
italian
and
spanish
takes
time
to
understand
and
embrace
traditional
italian
food
ranges
from
simple
pasta
dishes
to
vibrant
seafoods
but
american italian
food
has
its
own
appeal
meanwhile
cars
like
and
offer
a
taste
of
italian
luxury
but
there
s
more
to
than
the
cars
canal
tours
and
boat
rentals
allow
visitors
to
take
in
its
beauty
from
a
different
perspective
for
those
looking
to
explore
the
city
further
and
increase
their
car
knowledge
becoming
a
car
enthusiast
is
a
great
way
to
do
just
that
it
is
widely
accepted
that
both
physical
and
online
learning
in
the
classroom
setting
have
their
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
physical
learning
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
actively
engage
in
classroom
discussions
form
relationships
collaborate
and
foster
strong
connections
with
their
peers
and
teachers
on
the
other
hand
online
learning
allows
students
to
access
a
wider
range
of
materials
and
resources
and
is
often
more
convenient
for
students
with
difficulty
attending
traditional
classes
when
comparing
the
pros
and
cons
of
traditional
classroom
learning
and
distance
learning
both
have
strengths
and
drawbacks
traditional
classroom
learning
allows
for
a
hands on
approach
and
face to face
student
interaction
while
distance
learning
allows
for
more
independence
and
tailor made
learning
programs
however
distance
learning
can
also
be
hindered
by
technological
issues
and
students
may
feel
isolated
from
their
peers
the
potential
difficulties
faced
with
online
or
video
conferencing
may
include
difficulty
connecting
slow
connection
speeds
difficulties
using
the
necessary
programs
and
additional
time
needed

i
remember
a
time
when
i
experienced
failure
i
had
been
working
tirelessly
for
weeks
on
a
project
and
had
put
so
much
effort
and
energy
into
it
when
the
results
were
n t
what
i
had
hoped
for
the
disappointment
was
overwhelming
i
felt
so
let
down
and
frustrated
that
i
had
let
myself
down
it
took
time
but
i
was
able
to
reflect
on
the
experience
and
realize
that
failure
was
an
inevitable
part
of
life
and
instead
of
beating
myself
up
i
needed
to
pick
myself
up
and
learn
from
my
mistakes
in
the
end
i
found
the
courage
to
get
over
the
failure
and
start
again
learning
from
the
experience
helped
me
to
become
more
resilient
and
persistent
in
everything
i
chose
to
do
in
life
i
learned
that
i
was
capable
of
bouncing
back
from
failure
and
working
towards
something
greater
despite
the
bumps
on
the
road
the
experience
shaped
my
outlook
on
life
teaching
me
that
it
was
never
about
reaching
the
final
destination
it
was
about
the
journey
and
everything
that
came
with
it
the
culture
of
is
incredibly
diverse
and
vibrant
from
the
famous
soccer
team
to
the
wide
range
of
cuisines
and
activities
available
to
locals
there
is
something
to
appeal
to
everyone
french
cuisine
such
as
escargot
paté
and
ratatouille
can
be
found
in
the
many
restaurants
and
cafés
alongside
popular
asian
and

alike
can
explore

enjoy
a

ride
through

or
visit
the
many
attractions
and

found
throughout
while
religious
diversity
is
present
throughout
french
society
there
are
three
predominant
religions
in
christianity
and
each
religious
group
celebrates
its
own
set
of
holidays
such

which
are
usually
marked

finally
the

their
attitudes
towards

vary
depending

making
it
crucial
to
be
respectful

mindful
when
interacting

all
in
all
visiting
paints
a
truly
unique
picture
of
the
culture
and
lifestyles
of
french
people
listening
to
different
opinions
is
essential
for
approaching
issues
objectively
and
avoiding
bias
instead
of
automatically
assuming
that
one
s
preexisting
thoughts
are
correct
hearing
other
perspectives
allows
for
critical
thought
and
the
formation
of
more
rounded
opinions
by
taking
the
time
to
consider
the
variety
of
ideas
that
are
out
there
we
give
ourselves
the
opportunity
to
make
more
informed
decisions
constructive
criticism
can
be
a
powerful
tool
when
evaluating
someone
s
suggestion
an
open
dialogue
can
further
develop
someone
s
ideas
as
well
as
enhance
the
discussion
by
providing
further
insight
in
the
same
way
relying
on
the
expertise
of
others
provides
a
breadth
of
knowledge
when
looking
at
any
particular
topic
while
it
is
perfectly
normal
to
have
strong
opinions
it
is
also
essential
to
remain
open
to
the
views
and
experiences
of
others
attending
school
and
learning
from
home
have
both
their
benefits
and
disadvantages
for
students
studying
history
and
other
required
school
subjects
in
terms
of
attending
school
provides
students
with
more
access
to
in person
resources
such
as
tutoring
and
other
forms
of
academic
help
from
teachers
or
fellow
students
furthermore
with
the
guidance
of
multiple
teachers
students
can
more
easily
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
material
or
ask
questions
on
the
other
hand
taking
classes
from
home
may
have
effects
on
college
prospects
as
remote
learning
does
not
offer
students
physical
mentorship
and
networking
opportunities
although
learning
from
home
may
limit
future
college
prospects
for
some
students
it
may
actually
expand
them
real world
examples
such
as
the
ability
to
live
in
a
college
and
work
while
attending
do
exist
and
this
approach
can
be
beneficial
for
a
student
trying
to
balance
multiple
responsibilities
or
who
prefers
a
flexible
learning
schedule
by
taking
classes
remotely
a
student
might
gain
the
opportunity
to
hold
a
job
whereas
if
they
were
in
a
physical
classroom
they
might
be
too
restricted
when
considering
the
student
view
learning
from
home
can
have
a
greater
impact
on
mental
health
for
those
easily
distracted
by
the
presence
of
others
home
learning
can
be
less
stressful
in
addition
attending
physical
classes
requires
more
preparedness
as
well
as
having
to
wear
a
mask
and
adhere
to
other
protocols
depending
on
the
area
however
attending
school
is
also
important
for
developing
study
habits
and
discipline
when
looking
at
both
the
pros
and
cons
the
approach
which
is
more
beneficial
for
learning
history
and
other
required
school
subjects
might
ultimately
depend
on
the
students
themselves
and
the
situation
it
s
important
to
consider
not
only
the
academic
prospects
but
also
factors
such
as
ease
of
learning
and
how
their
mental
health
and
comfort
may
be
affected
in
each
situation
in

adopting
a
four day
work
week
with
hours
of
work
per
day
is
an
interesting
initiative
that
can
have
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
students
on
the
one
hand
it
could
appeal
to
those
who
are
looking
for
a
different
type
of
school
schedule
allowing
them
to
choose
to
attend
an
elective
school
instead
of
the
traditional
school
they
re
enrolled
in
on
the
other
hand
many
students
struggle
to
find
a
balance
between
their
work
and
studies
and
this
type
of
initiative
could
make
it
more
difficult
to
juggle
both
they
might
find
it
difficult
to
fit
their
work
into
hour
days
or
they
could
be
faced
with
the
prospect
of
having
to
work
on
the
day
off
disrupting
their
study
schedule
ultimately
an
initiative
like
this
should
be
carefully
considered
on
a
case
by
case
basis
traits
are
essential
components
of
our
personalities
and
identity
of
us
believe
that
these
traits
can
be
changed
and
altered
based
on
our
decisions
and
choices
but
is
this
something
that
is
within
our
control
in
this
essay
i
will
discuss
the
idea
that
we
can
choose
our
character
traits
and
explore
whether
we
can
exercise
discretion
over
traits
such
as
being
quiet
being
social
and
being
over
oneself
to
begin
let
s
consider
the
role
of
choice
in
determining
personality
traits
it
s
certainly
possible
for
us
to
choose
to
be
quiet
in
certain
social
settings
or
to
be
more
social
in
other
settings
in
this
way
our
level
of
sociability
can
be
determined
by
our
choice
in
the
moment
similarly
a
person
can
choose
to
focus
on
themselves
and
their
own
wellbeing
rather
than
serve
the
needs
of
others
although
not
every
person
will
make
the
same
decision
these
kinds
of
choices
are
made
by
many
individuals
in
different
situations
moreover
researchers
have
found
that
even
seemingly
unchangeable
traits
such
as
extroversion
and
introversion
can
be
taken
on
through
conscious
effort
over
time
for
example
an
introverted
person
can
choose
to
become
more
extroverted
by
making
small
changes
to
their
behavior
and
gradually
expanding
their
social
circle
an
extroverted
person
can
choose
to
become
more
introverted
by
limiting
their
social
engagements
and
doing
more
activities
alone
in
this
way
our
character
traits
are
not
necessarily
predetermined
by
our
genetic
makeup
but
can
be
altered
through
a
combination
of
conscious
effort
and
personal
choice
in
conclusion
it
is
possible
to
choose
our
character
traits
and
although
the
changes
may
take
some
time
they
are
definitely
within
our
control
whether
we
choose
to
be
quiet
or
social
or
to
focus
on
ourselves
or
others
it
is
all
determined
by
the
choices
we
make
in
doing
so
we
also
have
the
power
to
shape
our
identities
according
to
the
character
traits
we
choose
s
statement
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
is
one
that
resonates
with
many
as
it
eloquently
boils
down
the
mindset
of
a
successful
and
inspiring
individual
it
is
a
reminder
that
after
failure
one
must
remain
passionate
and
determined
in
order
to
see
success
in
the
end
himself
embodied
this
phrase
throughout
his
life
highlighted
by
his
long
and
varied
career
in
public
service
for
example
s
political
career
was
fraught
with
several
failure
most
notably
his
losing
the
general
election
despite
his
tremendous
effort
in
leading
the
country
during
although
his
party
was
soundly
defeated
did
not
lose
his
enthusiasm
and
instead
chose
to
continue
fighting
for
the
causes
he
believed
in
his
resilience
in
these
moments
of
failure
such
as
sticking
to
his
guns
when
delivering
his
iconic
ironic
proverb
in
the
middle
ofpolitcal
chaos
is
a
testament
to
his
ability
to
stay
motivated
despite
trying
times
in
addition
to
his
politics
s
record breaking
writing
career
was
filled
with
hurdles
despite
battling
depression
and
bouts
of
writer
s
block
never
lost
his
enthusiasm
for
writing
and
continued
to
persevere
until
he
completed
his
impressive
body
of
work
his
ability
to
continue
in
the
face
of
adversity
is
an
example
of
s
embodiment
of
his
own
famous
phrase
and
reinforces
the
notion
of
success
stemming
from
the
persistence
of
enthusiasm
ultimately
s
statement
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
is
a
reminder
that
the
essence
of
success
lies
not
in
avoiding
failure
but
in
staying
dedicated
and
passionate
whenever
it
occurs
s
own
experiences
in
politics
and
writing
demonstrate
that
remaining
enthusiastic
and
resilient
in
the
face
of
adversity
is
truly
the
driving
force
behind
success
recent
studies
suggest
that
separating
children
from
their
relatives
in
an
effort
to
diminish
their
tendency
to
perform
evil
acts
is
an
ineffective
approach
while
it
may
send
the
message
that
the
children
s
actions
have
significant
consequences
it
usually
results
in
further
disconnection
and
isolation
rather
than
long term
behavioral
changes
other
approaches
such
as
conflict
resolution
training
and
restorative
justice
show
far
greater
promise
in
helping
children
recognize
their
mistakes
and
resolve
conflicts
without
resorting
to
harmful
behaviors
resolution
training
teaches
children
how
to
recognize
express
and
resolve
feelings
while
restorative
justice
allows
them
to
reconcile
with
the
people
they
ve
hurt
and
take
responsibility
for
their
actions
while
there
is
no
one size fits all
approach
when
it
comes
to
curbing
evil
behavior
in
children
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
conflict
resolution
and
restorative
justice
are
some
of
the
most
effective
methods
available
these
strategies
create
an
environment
of
understanding
and
communication

children
to
work
through
their
problems

better

anything
is
possible
was
an
american
philosopher
renowned
for
his
writings
on
individualism
and
self reliance
he
believed
that
personal
growth
and
development
could
only
take
place
when
individuals
take
responsibility
for
their
own
lives
and
eschew
conformity
to
societal
norms
this
philosophy
can
be
applied
to

to
take
ownership
of

be
challenging
but
is
essential
in
order
to
move
forward
i
personally
experienced
the
importance
of
asking
for
help
when
deciding
between
two
job
offers
i
was
uncertain
which
was
best
but
after
speaking
to
an
older
colleague
i
found
the
confidence
to
trust
my
own
judgement
it
was
comforting
to
have
a
knowledgeable
person
provide
their
perspective
additionally
an
episode
of
the
television
show
black ish
explored
the
importance
of
family
support
and
dialogue
when
making
difficult
decisions
in
the
episode
the
protagonist
struggles
to
choose
between
two
career
paths
and
ultimately
relies
on
family
members
to
provide
guidance
in
the
political
realm
discussed
the
importance
of
asking
for
help
when
making
decisions
referenced
this
when
he
told
a
story
about
his
mother
s
life
and
how
she
leaned
on
her
community
for
support
when
making
important
choices
by
speaking
to
family
members
and
friends
s
mother
had
the
guidance
needed
to
make
the
right
decisions
these
examples
all
demonstrate
how
critically
important
it
is
to
ask
for
help
and
guidance
when
making
important
life
decisions
whether
the
advice
comes
from
prior
generations
family
members
or
other
trusted
confidants
having
the
support
surrounding
us
helps
us
have
the
confidence
to
make
the
right
choice
as
any
student
can
attest
the
value
of
knowledge
is
immense
increases
our
understanding
of
the
world
and
our
ability
to
navigate
it
however
for
me
imagination
has
proven
to
be
even
more
valuable
it
provides
an
invaluable
resource
when
seeking
to
understand
something
or
solve
a
problem
take
reading
books
for
example
while
knowledge
has
helped
me
to
reiterate
factual
information
about
a
certain
subject
it
does
n t
always
provide
insight
into
more
complex
ideas
or
provide
a
deeper
level
of
understanding
it
is
only
through
imagination
that
i
can
truly
engage
and
explore
an
idea
it
is
my
imagination
that
helps
me
to
open
up
possibilities
to
connect
ideas
to
think
outside
the
box
and
to
see
the
bigger
picture
or
benefit
this
same
benefit
of
imagination
carries
over
to
my
studies
and
learning
when
going
over
a
particularly
difficult
subject
i
often
find
myself
drawing
upon
my
imagination
for
inspiration
taking
a
step
back
and
looking
at
the
assignment
in
a
new
light
or
in
a
different
way
can
often
lead
me
down
some
interesting
paths
that
i
would
have
otherwise
missed
imagination
opens
up
the
ability
to
apply
the
knowledge
i
have
acquired
in
creative
and
innovative
ways
the
power
of
imagination
can
not
be
overstated
it
is
the
force
that
guides
our
learning
process
and
allows
us
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
the
material
we
are
studying
imagination
allows
us
to
go
beyond
the
facts
and
move
into
understanding
that
is
why
i
believe
that
imagination
is
far
more
important
than
knowledge
being
true
to
oneself
in
today
s
world
can
be
difficult
but
it
can
also
be
very
rewarding
on
the
one
hand
society
has
a
lot
of
pressures
and
expectations
placed
upon
us
which
can
make
it
difficult
to
stay
true
to
our
values
and
beliefs
on
the
other
hand
remaining
true
to
ourselves
can
be
incredibly
liberating
it
allows
us
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
to
be
seen
and
heard
and
to
express
who
we
truly
are
the
primary
advantage
of
being
true
to
ourselves
is
that
we
can
make
sure
our
choices
are
based
on
our
own
values
and
beliefs
we
can
take
pride
in
our
authentic
selves
rather
than
being
a
clone
of
what
society
expects
us
to
be
this
can
increase
our
self esteem
and
strengthen
our
confidence
allowing
us
to
face
life
with
more
courage
and
positivity
the
primary
disadvantage
of
being
true
to
oneself
is
that
it
means
going
against
the
grain
we
may
face
criticism
or
disapproval
from
others
or
be
excluded
from
certain
social
circles
we
can
become
a
target
for
bullying
or
mockery
if
we
express
our
opinions
openly
and
honestly
additionally
it
can
be
difficult
to
remain
true
to
ourselves
when
faced
with
peer
pressure
or
when
around
people
who
don
t
have
the
same
values
overall
being
true
to
oneself
in
a
world
trying
to
make
us
someone
else
can
be
a
challenging
yet
rewarding
journey
our
authenticity
is
ours
and
ours
alone
something
that
no
one
else
can
take
away
from
us
having
the
strength
to
stand
against
the
tide
and
remain
true
to
ourselves
can
be
the
greatest
victory
of
all
online
classes
are
a
great
benefit
to
students
who
are
balancing
a
career
family
commitments
and
those
living
in
remote
locations
students
with
jobs
are
able
to
take
classes
around
their
schedules
without
the
need
to
travel
to
a
campus
making
it
easier
for
them
to
finish
a
degree
students
with
family
commitments
have
the
flexibility
to
move
at
their
own
pace
completing
classes
around
their
existing
schedule
online
classes
also
benefit
those
living
in
remote
areas
since
they
can
access
courses
they
may
not
have
access
to
otherwise
online
classes
can
provide
a
level
of
convenience
and
flexibility
that
could
not
be
achieved
on
a
campus
break
in
many
countries
is
a
much needed
time
of
rest
and
relaxation
for
students
and
educators
alike
for
many
people
this
break
acts
not
just
as
a
chance
to
take
a
breather
but
a
catalyst
to
explore
new
ideas
cultures
and
opportunities
shortening
the
summer
break
would
be
a
disservice
to
students
particularly
those
coming
from
a
different
country
or
those
in
an
education
system
with
short
or
no
winter
and
spring
breaks
one
common
issue
among
students
from
different
countries
is
the
lack
of
a
traditional
summer
holiday
in
many
countries
students
work
longer
hours
during
the
summer
months
and
are
not
able
to
enjoy
the
freedom
and
relaxation
of
a
summer
break
on
the
other
hand
those
who
have
the
luxury
of
summer
break
often
make
time
to
explore
other
cultures
visit
new
places
and
pursue
interests
that
are
not
possible
during
the
school
year
all
of
these
experiences
contribute
to
a
learning
experience
that
is
valuable
in
its
own
right
and
cutting
short
summer
break
would
severely
limit
these
experiences
for
students
from
different
countries
for
those
in
an
education
system
with
short
or
no
winter
and
spring
breaks
the
summer
serves
as
both
a
time
of
rest
and
renewal
without
these
additional
breaks
students
are
more
likely
to
suffer
from
burnout
due
to
the
constant
pressure
of
learning
and
academic
expectations
a
long
summer
break
allows
students
to
take
a
step
back
and
relax
enabling
them
to
re enter
the
school
year
feeling
refreshed
and
ready
to
learn
in
conclusion
summer
break
should
not
be
shortened
it
is
an
important
opportunity
for
students
from
different
countries
as
well
as
those
within
the
education
system
who
experience
short
or
no
winter
and
spring
breaks
a
shortened
summer
break
would
not
only
be
detrimental
to
students
physical
and
mental
health
but
would
deprive
them
of
invaluable
experiences
that
come
from
exploring
different
cultures
and
places
i
believe
that
community
service
should
be
optional
for
students
service
is
an
invaluable
experience
but
compelling
students
to
participate
can
quickly
turn
it
into
a
chore
rather
than
something
meaningful
while
making
it
optional
may
lead
to
fewer
people
engaging
in
community
service
it
also
allows
those
that
do
participate
to
do
so
out
of
genuine
interest
and
passion
this
passion
and
enthusiasm
can
be
contagious
inspiring
more
people
to
become
involved
and
make
community
service
a
more
integral
part
of
their
lives
after
research
and
analysis
i
believe
that
the
company
i
am
applying
to
has
many
benefits
that
would
fit
my
personal
goals
and
ambitions
this
includes
a
comprehensive
benefits
package
competitive
salaries
and
opportunities
for
career
advancement
and
growth
additionally
they
offer
unique
and
innovative
opportunities
for
collaboration
with
team
members
as
well
as
a
supportive
environment
that
encourages
employees
to
take
ownership
of
their
work
furthermore
the
company
s
commitment
to
workplace
diversity
and
inclusion
helps
to
create
a
more
welcoming
and
productive
environment
that
will
be
beneficial
for
both
my
professional
and
personal
development
i
am
confident
that
with
these
benefits
in
place
my
ambition
to
be
successful
in
my
career
path
can
become
a
reality
family
and
friends
it
s
time
to
get
outside
and
have
some
fun
i
m
inviting
you
all
over
for
an
outdoor
get together
i
m
grilling
up
some
delicious
food
like
hamburgers
hot
dogs
carne
asada
tacos
and
barbacoa
for
everyone
to
enjoy
we
ll
also
be
playing
some
classic
outdoor
games
like
soccer
football
running
races
or
baseball
and
to
top
it
off
i
m
playing
some
music
but
not
too
loudly
and
lastly
i
m
inviting
my
son
daughter
and
their
dates
and
their
parents
to
join
us
so
make
sure
to
bring
them
along
as
well
ca
n t
wait
to
see
you
all
there
in
this
famous
quote
reminds
us
that
being
productive
is
incredibly
important
being
idle
and
not
doing
anything
can
have
a
huge
negative
impact
on
our
lives
we
can
miss
out
on
opportunities
and
potential
growth
and
development
people
who
are
productive
can
experience
many
benefits
such
as
greater
confidence
increased
problem solving
skills
and
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
productivity
can
also
help
us
become
stronger
and
more
helpful
to
others
we
can
use
our
experiences
and
knowledge
to
counsel
and
guide
others
to
become
successful
overall
this
quote
serves
as
a
gentle
reminder
to
us
all
of
how
essential
it
is
to
stay
active
and
productive
implementing
a
policy
where
any
student
receiving
a
grade
of
less
than
a
in
class
would
be
excluded
from
participating
in
school
activities
could
have
several
benefits
for
students
and
teachers
alike
for
students
such
a
policy
might
provide
an
incentive
to
take
their
studies
more
seriously
as
there
would
be
direct
and
immediate
consequences
for
below average
grades
additionally
it
could
offer
a
structure
that
encourages
scholastic
success
since
those
students
who
are
motivated
to
achieve
higher
grades
would
be
rewarded
with
chances
to
participate
in
school
activities
for
teachers
this
policy
could
mean
lower
stress
levels
and
a
more
productive
learning
environment
not
only
would
the
teacher
be
able
to
focus
on
quality
instruction
rather
than
attempting
to
encourage
a
struggling
student
but
the
other
students
would
also
be
more
engaged
in
their
learning
encouraged
by
the
absence
of
any
disruption
caused
by
a
student
with
below average
grades
ultimately
by
communicating
the
consequences
of
underperforming
in
their
classes
a
policy
like
this
could
be
an
effective
tool
for
improving
both
student
performance
and
overall
school
environment
currently
the
majority
of
public
and
private
schools
in
the
states
follow
a
traditional
scholastic
structure
that
follows
a
set
daily
schedule
usually
lasting
from
a m
to
p m
the
implications
of
this
school
schedule
include
stress
on
students
an
overly academic
curriculum
and
limited
availability
for
extracurricular
activities
the
idea
of
implementing
an
extended
school
day
is
an
attractive
but
often
negative
prospect
as
it
could
lead
to
fatigue
and
decreased
enthusiasm
for
learning
as
well
as
an
overall
decrease
in
academic
performance
an
extended
school
day
could
also
create
incompatibilities
for
both
students
and
related
individuals
such
as
parents
guardians
or
teachers
while
an
extended
school
day
may
come
with
some
potential
benefits
such
as
increased
academic
opportunities
improved
communication
outreach
and
a
more
flexible
curricular
structure
there
are
potential
problems
associated
with
it
that
must
be
considered
parents
guardians
and
teachers
would
all
have
to
adjust
their
schedules
in
order
to
accommodate
a
longer
school
day
which
could
create
a
strain
due
to
the
need
for
additional
childcare
options
additionally
an
extended
school
day
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
stress
and
anxiety
for
students
as
they
struggle
to
find
balance
between
their
academic
and
social
lives
the
benefits
of
taking
music
drama
and
art
classes
for
students
should
not
be
underestimated
these
activities
can
not
only
give
young
people
the
opportunity
to
express
their
creativity
but
can
also
help
to
sustain
their
mental
health
for
instance
music
can
act
as
a
form
of
mindfulness
and
provide
an
essential
outlet
for
stress
relief
classes
can
also
offer
invaluable
opportunities
to
practice
interpersonal
communication
skills
such
as
public
speaking
as
well
as
giving
students
an
opportunity
to
build
confidence
and
find
their
own
creative
voice
however
it
is
also
important
to
touch
upon
the
potential
drawbacks
to
taking
music
drama
and
arts
classes
for
instance
these
activities
can
be
time consuming
and
can
take
away
from
time
that
students
could
have
spent
on
schoolwork
furthermore
there
is
often
an
intimidating
element
that
comes
with
these
types
of
performances
having
an
audience
can
be
difficult
for
some
students
especially
those
who
are
more
introverted
importantly
parental
support
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
success
of
taking
these
activities
without
encouragement
from
their
parents
to
try
new
things
and
promote
confidence
students
may
not
have
the
confidence
to
try
out
these
activities
or
feel
comfortable
enough
to
do
so
encouragement
from
parents
can
make
the
whole
experience
less
stressful
and
more
enjoyable
overall
examples
of
this
could
include
providing
support
when
students
are
preparing
for
an
upcoming
performance
or
class
additionally
parents
can
attend
classes
and
shows
with
their
children
to
celebrate
their
successes
ultimately
having
this
type
of
parental
support
is
essential
for
students
in
these
activities
is
the
use
of
exaggerated
language
for
emphasis
an
example
of
hyperbole
is
he
was
so
hungry
he
could
have
eaten
a
horse
is
the
use
of
words
to
imitate
sounds
an
example
of
onomatopoeia
is
the
siren
blared
is
the
comparison
of
two
unlike
things
using
like
or
as
an
example
of
simile
is
he
was
as
tall
as
a
tree
is
a
comparison
of
two
unlike
things
without
using
like
or
as
an
example
of
metaphor
is
his
whispered
words
were
a
soothing
balm
personification
is
the
giving
of
human
qualities
to
non humans
an
example
of
personification
is
the
wind
howled
in
despair
all
of
these
techniques
are
used
to
create
emotion
and
imagery
they
differ
in
the
way
they
are
expressed
as
hyperbole
and
onomatopoeia
often
use
a
more
literal
approach
to
emphasize
a
point
while
simile
metaphor
and
personification
use
comparisons
to
help
the
reader
visualize
the
desired
image
after
thorough
research
i
have
decided
on
a
career
path
that
interests
me
to
gain
further
knowledge
of
the
career
i
plan
on
attending
electives
or
classes
related
to
the
field
of
study
additionally
i
am
creating
a
plan
to
boost
my
confidence
and
knowledge
so
i
can
further
pursue
the
career
to
obtain
experience
and
build
financial
stability
in
the
field
i
am
considering
working
part time
in
the
chosen
area
of
study
i
believe
that
taking
these
steps
is
the
best
way
to
ensure
success
in
my
chosen
career
path
in
today
s
world
oftentimes
the
greatest
gift
we
can
give
another
person
is
a
simple
act
of
kindness
whether
it
s
a
smile
in
passing
a
word
of
encouragement
or
a
friendly
gesture
any
act
of
kindness
has
the
potential
to
have
a
high
impact
on
someone
s
life
for
starters
research
has
shown
that
an
act
of
kindness
has
a
ripple
effect
of
its
own
a
single
action
can
cause
a
chain
of
reactions
that
spread
outward
positively
affecting
the
lives
of
multiple
people
if
we
look
at
the
example
of
a
coach
who
takes
the
time
to
mentor
a
younger
person
that
coach
s
act
of
kindness
can
not
only
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
life
of
the
child
but
also
the
child
s
family
community
and
beyond
moreover
an
act
of
kindness
can
also
act
as
a
source
of
inspiration
when
one
person
performs
an
act
of
kindness
it
has
the
potential
to
motivate
others
to
act
similarly
it
is
possible
that
the
kindness
one
person
shows
can
have
a
far
reaching
effect
and
encourage
people
to
improve
the
lives
of
those
around
them
however
perhaps
most
importantly
an
act
of
kindness
can
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
someone
s
self esteem
and
mental
health
by
showing
someone
that
they
are
important
and
valued
it
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
how
that
person
values
and
views
themself
an
act
of
kindness
can
provide
hope
and
comfort
to
someone
who
might
be
in
need
ultimately
acts
of
kindness
can
bring
incredible
positivity
to
both
those
who
perform
them
and
those
who
receive
them
whether
it
s
a
small
gesture
or
a
larger
commitment
any
act
of
kindness
has
the
capacity
to
dramatically
improve
someone
s
life
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
had
a
difficult
time
staying
on
top
of
my
homework
i
struggled
to
find
motivation
to
finish
my
assignments
and
often
faced
the
consequences
of
not
turning
them
in
on
time
working
with
a
group
of
other
students
in
an
after school
homework
club
would
have
been
a
great
advantage
for
me
having
peers
around
to
help
each
other
with
difficult
assignments
ask
questions
and
provide
support
would
have
made
it
easier
for
me
to
not
only
finish
my
assignments
on
time
but
even
to
finish
them
early
furthermore
by
working
collaboratively
with
others
on
the
same
material
i
would
have
gained
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
material
and
in
turn
a
better
grade
in
addition
to
improving
student
performance
joining
a
homework
club
can
help
students
sharpen
their
communication
skills
it
teaches
students
to
work
together
reach
compromises
with
other
people
s
ideas
and
better
articulate
and
defend
their
own
thoughts
and
opinions
working
on
projects
together
to
finish
assignments
can
help
students
learn
how
to
cooperate
socially
and
academically
in
conclusion
an
after school
homework
club
is
a
great
resource
for
students
looking
to
improve
their
grades
deepen
their
understanding
of
the
material
and
sharpen
their
communication
skills
it
can
ease
the
burden
of
completing
assignments
and
provide
an
encouraging
and
helpful
environment
that
can
facilitate
learning
and
collaboration
on
my
first
day
working
at
my
uncle
s
marble
shop
i
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
awe
and
excitement
with
both
admiration
and
fear
i
glanced
around
at
the
beautiful
slabs
of
marble
that
seemed
to
come
in
every
hue
imaginable
knowing
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
work
with
and
learn
from
my
uncle
made
me
feel
a
unique
combination
of
anticipation
and
trepidation
when
i
made
my
first
mistake
my
uncertainty
and
doubt
grew
exponentially
i
thought
that
i
had
failed
my
uncle
and
i
felt
embarrassed
and
ashamed
i
didn
t
think
that
i
had
the
skills
or
experience
necessary
to
do
the
job
however
my
uncle
quickly
put
my
worries
to
rest
by
reassuring
and
encouraging
me
and
trusting
me
to
try
again
through
this
experience
i
learned
that
missteps
should
not
be
feared
i
left
my
uncle
s
marble
shop
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
pride
knowing
that
i
could
persevere
and
overcome
any
challenge
my
uncle
s
guidance
reaffirmed
a
deep
underlying
truth
that
i
have
carried
with
me
since
we
all
make
mistakes
and
we
can
always
learn
from
them
if
we
stay
open
and
positive
working
with
him
at
the
marble
shop
opened
me
up
to
a
world
of
knowledge
and
understanding
and
taught
me
about
the
importance
of
resilience
and
growth
famously
wrote
that
is
a
journey
not
a
destination
this
simple
statement
succinctly
captures
the
importance
of
exploring
beyond
our
comfort
zones
in
order
to
truly
lead
a
fulfilled
life
it
is
necessary
to
be
willing
to
take
risks
be
open
to
new
experiences
and
try
the
things
that
challenge
us
doing
so
will
yield
tremendous
rewards
both
personally
and
professionally
one
great
example
of
a
person
who
stepped
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
and
achieved
amazing
success
is
after
rising
up
from
an
impoverished
childhood
created
an
entire
media
empire
despite
not
having
any
previous
experience
in
the
television
and
film
industries
she
took
a
risk
believed
in
her
dreams
and
ended
up
creating
history
with
her
tremendous
success
another
example
of
taking
a
leap
of
faith
outside
of
one
s
comfort
zone
is
drawn
from
my
own
personal
experience
when
i
was
younger
i
was
incredibly
shy
and
introverted
and
was
always
nervous
and
afraid
to
try
new
things
however
once
i
made
the
conscious
effort
to
step
out
of
my
comfort
zone
i
have
achieved
more
confidence
and
have
gone
on
to
accomplish
some
of
my
biggest
life
goals
ultimately
the
best
approach
is
to
embrace
the
idea
of
continuing
to
explore
and
push
limits
as
said
do
the
thing
you
fear
and
the
death
of
fear
is
certain
beyond
our
comfort
zones
will
always
lead
to
personal
growth
and
a
deeper
understanding
of
ourselves
and
our
world
is
a
widespread
problem
in
today
s
society
and
is
a
major
contributor
to
the
psychological
distress
of
many
individuals
people
may
resort
to
bullying
because
they
are
seeking
validation
feel
insecure
or
are
trying
to
cope
with
their
own
sense
of
powerlessness
unfortunately
the
consequences
of
bullying
can
be
severe
those
who
bully
can
suffer
from
depression
anxiety
low
self esteem
and
feelings
of
guilt
additionally
in
some
states
bullying
can
be
punishable
by
law
to
best
address
the
issue
of
bullying
it
is
imperative
that
we
work
to
create
communities
that
foster
understanding
and
acceptance
this
can
involve
providing
support
for
those
who
bully
educating
people
on
the
consequences
of
bullying
and
encouraging
open
dialogue
about
the
issue
we
must
also
learn
to
recognize
and
respect
the
human
dignity
of
all
individuals
regardless
of
race
gender
ethnicity
class
or
any
other
difference
only
by
recognizing
the
value
of
every
individual
can
we
strive
to
cultivate
a
more
equitable
society
and
to
combat
the
bullying
that
so
often
threatens
our
sense
of
safety
and
security
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
ways
to
spend
time
at
a
park
is
bird
watching
seeing
different
types
of
birds
from
majestic
eagles
soaring
in
the
sky
to
feathered
warblers
chirping
in
the
trees
can
provide
a
relaxing
and
peaceful
experience
you
can
also
take
a
picnic
to
the
park
bringing
blankets
and
snacks
to
sit
and
enjoy
with
friends
or
family
other
activities
like
reading
jogging
and
bike
riding
can
fill
a
day
in
the
park
with
fun
if
you
re
looking
for
something
more
interactive
many
parks
offer
organized
sports
such
as
group
softball
games
or
fishing
derbies
so
when
you
re
ready
for
a
break
from
the
everyday
why
not
visit
your
local
park
and
find
out
what
s
possible
working
together
on
projects
benefits
everyone
involved
by
enabling
each
group
member
to
bring
their
own
individual
talent
perspective
and
resources
to
the
project
members
have
the
opportunity
to
share
their
skills
and
collaborate
their
ideas
which
can
make
the
results
of
the
project
both
more
innovative
and
more
efficient
working
in
a
group
can
also
alleviate
the
burden
of
having
to
complete
the
entire
project
by
oneself
by
splitting
the
tasks
amongst
the
group
the
workload
is
spread
out
and
less
stress
is
placed
on
one
person
to
do
all
the
work
additionally
when
working
in
a
group
help
is
always
nearby
in
those
moments
where
the
project
is
particularly
overwhelming
the
collective
energy
of
group
collaboration
can
also
be
highly
motivating
encouraging
each
group
member
to
push
further
and
strive
for
a
more
ambitious
end
product
ultimately
working
in
a
group
is
a
great
way
for
people
to
pool
their
collective
talents
and
create
something
greater
than
what
any
individual
could
achieve
on
their
own
as
i
approached
the
doctor
s
clinic
i
could
feel
the
buzz
of
activity
a
team
of
doctors
nurses
and
support
staff
worked
in
a
flurry
gathering
supplies
and
monitoring
patient
charts
i
watched
as
the
doctor
and
staff
members
interacted
discussing
the
decisions
that
had
to
be
made
and
the
treatments
that
needed
to
be
done
when
it
was
time
for
my
appointment
the
doctor
welcomed
me
warmly
into
the
office
we
spoke
at
length
about
their
experiences
in
the
medical
field
and
they
shared
with
me
some
of
the
challenges
and
rewards
of
their
job
i
asked
questions
about
the
tools
they
used
and
the
situations
they
faced
on
a
daily
basis
and
they
provided
me
with
insightful
advice
for
pursuing
a
career
in
medicine
at
one
point
i
received
an
invitation
to
observe
a
real life
operation
in
the
operating
theater
i
witnessed
the
doctor
and
nurses
in
action
and
i
was
struck
by
their
confidence
and
skill
as
they
operated
on
the
patient
as
i
watched
i
took
detailed
notes
about
the
doctor
s
work
environment
the
materials
used
and
the
decisions
they
faced
the
experience
at
the
doctor
s
clinic
was
eye opening
and
i
feel
more
equipped
now
to
pursue
my
career
aspirations
in
medicine
as
the
pressure
to
succeed
increases
the
role
of
praise
in
educational
settings
has
become
more
prominent
a
recent
study
investigated
how
praising
student
s
deficient
work
affects
their
self esteem
learning
standards
and
their
likelihood
of
graduating
high
school
the
study
included
students
from
multiple
high
schools
across
the
country
and
monitored
their
responses
to
praise
and
criticism
the
findings
showed
that
students
who
were
praised
for
work
that
was
below
expectations
had
better
self esteem
higher
academic
standards
and
were
more
likely
to
graduate
high
school
than
those
who
received
criticism
this
provides
evidence
that
praising
student
s
deficient
work
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
their
development
it
follows
then
that
providing
appropriate
praise
which
encourages
and
motivates
students
should
be
incorporated
into
educational
curriculums
one
of
the
main
times
it
may
not
be
beneficial
to
show
kindness
is
when
a
person
is
the
victim
of
bullying
than
just
standing
by
and
being
kind
in
this
situation
one
might
consider
voicing
their
opinion
in
defense
of
the
person
being
bullied
and
more
actively
standing
up
for
them
this
can
have
negative
consequences
however
as
it
is
unlikely
the
bully
will
view
this
as
an
act
of
kindness
the
bully
and
their
friends
may
see
this
as
a
challenge
to
their
authority
and
they
might
react
negatively
in
addition
one
must
use
their
best
judgement
to
decide
if
a
situation
requires
kindness
or
discipline
sometimes
it
may
be
best
to
be
kind
and
forgive
someone
s
misbehavior
while
in
other
cases
it
is
better
to
be
firm
and
demand
respect
for
yourself
and
those
around
you
in
some
cases
it
is
truly
not
beneficial
to
show
kindness
to
people
who
do
not
deserve
it
as
this
can
often
be
taken
for
granted
and
lead
to
more
trouble
in
the
long
run
districts
across
the
country
are
now
offering
shorter
pathways
for
high
school
students
allowing
them
to
graduate
in
three
instead
of
four
years
this
ambitious
proposal
while
it
has
its
drawbacks
is
not
without
its
benefits
those
who
complete
the
three year
program
can
achieve
financial
independence
earlier
by
starting
their
career
or
college
sooner
and
have
more
time
to
acquire
valuable
life
experience
during
the
duration
of
their
studies
the
primary
concern
of
such
accelerated
programs
is
that
students
may
not
have
enough
time
to
truly
devote
to
their
studies
and
could
be
overwhelmed
by
heavy
course
loads
and
a
truncated
timeline
in
order
to
ensure
students
are
retaining
their
education
some
school
districts
may
have
to
reduce
the
number
of
extracurricular
activities
and
limit
certain
subjects
such
as
science
or
foreign
language
while
there
will
always
be
pros
and
cons
associated
with
any
program
the
potential
benefits
of
offering
shorter
pathways
for
high
school
students
can
not
be
ignored
by
pursuing
such
accelerated
studies
students
can
work
towards
financial
independence
receive
the
life
experience
they
need
for
career
or
college
success
and
further
their
education
with
more
opportunities
for
advanced
training
once
famously
declared
that
nothing
can
stop
the
man
with
the
right
mental
attitude
from
achieving
his
goal
nothing
on
earth
can
help
the
man
with
the
wrong
mental
attitude
his
words
have
a
powerful
resonance
in
our
present
day
for
it
is
clear
that
those
who
act
on
their
dreams
and
goals
can
achieve
far
more
than
those
who
do
not
to
put
it
simply
having
an
active
attitude
of
determination
and
ambition
can
truly
bring
success
when
examining
individuals
who
actively
strive
to
reach
their
ambitions
the
key
component
is
the
clear
focus
on
their
objectives
they
will
create
tangible
plans
allowing
them
to
establish
deadlines
and
strides
in
reaching
their
goals
to
illustrate
this
idea
we
can
consider
the
example
of
an
ambitious
man
who
sought
to
revolutionize
the
world
of
technology
he
did
not
simply
wait
for
his
goals
to
come
to
fruition
instead
he
was
actively
involved
in
every
step
of
the
creation
process
from
in depth
market
research
to
detailed
product
testing
and
design
in
contrast
there
are
those
who
fail
to
reach
their
dreams
because
they
do
not
strive
to
actively
pursue
their
goals
those
who
do
not
have
a
clear
focus
do
not
tend
to
be
willing
to
make
sacrifices
or
take
risks
to
push
themselves
further
for
example
many
aspiring
entrepreneurs
will
not
risk
their
financial
security
in
order
to
invest
in
their
ideas
as
they
are
not
motivated
to
work
towards
their
dreams
in
conclusion
it
is
undeniably
true
that
individuals
who
have
an
active
ambition
to
strive
towards
their
goals
will
become
more
successful
than
those
who
do
not
as
stated
by
achieving
one
s
ambitions
does
not
come
easy
and
for
those
willing
to
work
hard
the
rewards
can
be
great
no
matter
who
you
are
it
is
important
to
accomplish
something
in
life
whether
it
is
achieving
a
goal
taking
on
a
challenge
or
breaking
an
old
habit
setting
goals
and
accomplishing
them
is
essential
achieving
your
goals
can
help
you
improve
yourself
and
provide
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
pride
for
instance
if
you
set
a
goal
to
get
in
shape
working
out
consistently
and
seeing
results
will
give
you
a
sense
of
accomplishment
also
if
you
take
on
a
challenge
like
learning
a
new
language
you
feel
more
confident
in
your
abilities
another
reason
to
accomplish
something
in
life
is
to
avoid
boredom
often
people
find
themselves
repeating
daily
routines
with
no
excitement
or
enthusiasm
by
setting
goals
and
challenging
yourself
you
can
stay
motivated
and
interested
and
experience
new
levels
of
fun
and
energy
for
example
if
you
like
to
play
video
games
you
might
challenge
yourself
to
beat
a
new
game
or
break
a
personal
score
this
will
give
you
a
greater
sense
of
enjoyment
when
playing
as
well
as
providing
a
sense
of
accomplishment
finally
accomplishing
something
is
a
great
way
to
gain
pride
in
one
s
accomplishments
when
you
achieve
something
you
can
look
back
and
be
proud
of
yourself
celebrate
your
successes
no
matter
how
small
for
example
if
you
set
a
goal
to
save
money
do
something
meaningful
when
you
reach
it
such
as
going
out
for
dinner
with
friends
or
treating
yourself
to
something
special
being
proud
of
your
accomplishments
will
only
build
up
your
resilience
and
confidence
and
make
you
more
likely
to
push
yourself
to
achieve
more
in
conclusion
there
are
numerous
reasons
to
accomplish
something
in
life
be
it
achieving
goals
avoiding
boredom
or
gaining
pride
in
one
s
accomplishments
it
is
essential
to
set
goals

to
reach
them
not
only
will
you
improve

but
you
will
reap
the
rewards
of
feeling
satisfied
and
proud
of
your

many
students
struggle
to
decide
on
a
career
path
at
a
young
age
some
may
feel
like
there
s
too
much
pressure
to
decide
while
others
may
be
overwhelmed
by
the
wide
range
of
options
available
in
any
case
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
on
the
plus
side
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
gives
one
time
to
plan
strategize
and
prepare
for
the
future
having
a
clear
end
goal
in
mind
can
help
generate
focus
and
motivate
one
to
stay
on
track
with
progress
for
instance
if
a
student
commits
to
becoming
a
doctor
they
may
take
advanced
math
and
science
classes
in
high
school
to
get
a
jump
start
on
their
future
medical
training
on
the
flip
side
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
limit
one
s
options
and
opportunities
it
may
be
that
the
young
student
s
interests
and
aptitudes
change
and
that
the
career
they
had
decided
on
is
no
longer
the
best
fit
for
instance
if
a
student
had
wanted
to
become
a
dentist
but
discovers
a
passion
for
architecture
afterwards
there
can
be
a
significant
amount
of
disruption
and
setback
for
their
pre planned
career
path
in
conclusion
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
a
great
way
to
help
prepare
for
the
future
but
it
s
important
to
have
the
flexibility
to
alter
one
s
plans
if
interests
and
aptitudes
change
having
a
clear
vision
of
future
goals
self awareness
of
one
s
interests
and
strengths
and
a
commitment
to
working
hard
are
all
key
components
to
successful
career
planning
in
order
to
graduate
from
high
school
in
this
particular
school
district
students
must
complete
certain
required
classes
and
accompanying
assessments
these
requirements
may
vary
slightly
based
on
the
student
s
individual
program
but
typically
include
classes
such
as
mathematics
science
and
social
studies
additionally
students
must
earn
a
satisfactory
score
on
the
state mandated
of
exams
for
each
of
those
core
subjects
the
tests
are
designed
to
evaluate
how
well
students
have
acquired
the
relevant
knowledge
and
skills
for
their
grade
level
and
therefore
successful
performance
on
these
exams
is
critical
in
order
for
a
student
to
earn
a
high
school
diploma
with
this
in
mind
it
is
important
for
students
to
adequately
prepare
for
these
exams
and
take
them
seriously
is
an
important
milestone
and
it
is
essential
for
each
student
to
have
the
required
classes
and
assessments
successfully
completed
in
order
to
advance
beyond
the
high
school
level
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
is
an
option
that
many
students
are
beginning
to
consider
while
it
may
provide
a
number
of
financial
and
educational
benefits
there
may
be
some
drawbacks
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
one
of
the
obvious
pros
is
the
ability
to
save
time
and
money
and
graduate
college
at
a
younger
age
however
this
option
may
not
be
suitable
for
students
who
have
difficulty
keeping
up
with
a
faster
pace
of
studies
additionally
a
student
s
sleep
schedule
and
potential
for
financial
aid
or
scholarships
may
be
affected
ultimately
while
graduating
early
may
have
its
advantages
it
s
important
to
evaluate
the
individual
needs
and
goals
of
each
student
and
decide
whether
it
is
a
beneficial
and
viable
alternative
to
a
traditional
four
year
program
my
friend
decided
to
take
the
challenge
of
completing
her
high
school
studies
in
three
years
on
one
hand
she
was
able
to
get
a
head
start
on
her
college
education
and
saved
a
significant
amount
of
money
she
didn
t
have
to
pay
the
costly
fees
associated
with
four
years
of
high
school
on
the
other
hand
she
felt
as
though
she
was
lacking
preparation
for
some
of
her
college
classes
because
she
had
to
cover
a
lot
of
material
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
she
reported
feeling
organized
and
focused
but
it
was
a
lot
of
work
to
finish
on
time
i
also
talked
to
another
friend
who
took
the
three year
high
school
program
he
reported
having
to
sacrifice
his
social
life
and
extracurricular
activities
to
keep
up
with
his
studies
additionally
he
shared
that
it
felt
like
a
big
transition
from
high
school
to
college
having
to
jump
right
into
rigorous
college
courses
it
appears
that
the
three year
high
school
program
can
be
a
successful
option
for
some
students
but
it
is
not
without
drawbacks
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
planning
focus
and
dedication
to
finish
the
program
successfully
maintaining
one
s
individual
identity
is
essential
to
leading
a
successful
life
people
often
conform
to
societal
standards
but
a
commitment
to
one
s
own
values
and
beliefs
often
leads
to
a
greater
personal
satisfaction
and
success
s
quote
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
captures
the
importance
of
forging
one
s
own
path
in
order
to
lead
an
authentic
life
one
example
of
this
is
the
story
of
orphaned
at
a
young
age
encountered
discrimination
as
an
african
but
went
on
to
become
a
three time
gold
medalist
in
track
and
field
later
she
became
a
teacher
and
mentor
inspiring
others
to
remain
true
to
themselves
regardless
of
the
obstacles
by
remaining
true
to
her
identity
was
able
to
make
a
lasting
impact
that
transcended
any
societal
boundaries
that
had
been
placed
before
her
this
resonates
with
the
quote
ultimately
staying
true
to
one
s
own
identity
is
what
leads
to
the
greatest
success
being
productive
is
a
powerful
tool
for
achieving
success
and
good
health
through
heightened
productivity
one
is
able
to
actively
pursue
their
goals
often
with
swiftness
efficiency
and
effectiveness
as
such
many
successful
individuals
throughout
history
have
attributed
much
of
their
success
partly
or
entirely
to
their
productivity
include
whose
focus
on
innovation
and
productivity
revolutionized
the
technology
industry
who
applied
his
productive
approach
to
several
industries
including
space
exploration
and
automobile
engineering
and
who
used
her
productive
approach
to
create
her
own
media
empire
from
scratch
leads
to
success
and
health
in
three
key
ways
firstly
it
enables
us
to
make
the
most
of
our
time
by
allocating
our
resources
efficiently
this
generates
more
time
for
rest
and
leisure
thus
providing
an
opportunity
for
people
to
maintain
and
improve
their
overall
wellbeing
secondly
pursuing
objectives
efficiently
through
productivity
can
lead
to
tangible
results
such
as
financial
prosperity
which
itself
leads
to
better
physical
and
mental
health
lastly
it
provides
a
sense
of
purpose
and
fulfillment
which
is
often
essential
for
both
our
physical
and
psychological
well being
in
conclusion
it
can
be
seen
that
productivity
is
a
fundamental
ingredient
for
achieving
success
and
good
health
by
learning
how
to
be
productive
and
organized
in
our
approach
we
can
keep
track
of
our
objectives
and
goals
make
the
most
of
our
resources
pursue
our
dreams
and
ambitions
and
develop
a
meaningful
impact
in
both
our
lives
and
the
lives
of
others
taking
an
active
and
productive
approach
to
life
thus
provides
us
with
the
opportunity
to
maximize
our
potential
in
a
wide
range
of
fields
while
still
allowing
us
to
maintain
our
overall
wellbeing
taking
some
free
time
to
relax
and
break
away
from
a
work
or
school
task
can
have
both
beneficial
and
detrimental
effects
on
achieving
individual
goals
studies
have
indicated
that
when
managed
carefully
taking
breaks
throughout
the
day
can
significantly
improve
productivity
for
those
working
in
busy
environments
workers
who
take
regular
breaks
tend
to
remain
more
engaged
in
their
tasks
while
having
an
improved
ability
to
recall
and
recall
information
on
the
other
hand
too
much
inactivity
can
lead
to
decreases
in
productivity
and
motivation
and
can
make
it
more
challenging
to
complete
tasks
in
a
given
amount
of
time
the
importance
of
effective
time
management
when
trying
to
accomplish
a
goal
can
not
be
overstated
planning
out
a
schedule
and
setting
aside
designated
periods
of
time
to
complete
tasks
can
help
keep
idle
time
to
a
minimum
and
ensure
that
progress
is
being
made
having
a
daily
to do
list
and
breaking
tasks
up
into
smaller
more
manageable
pieces
can
also
help
increase
overall
productivity
and
allow
for
more
free
time
during
the
day
by
implementing
effective
time
management
strategies
individuals
can
maximize
their
potential
and
reach
their
fullest
potential
in
today
s
world
it
s
easy
to
forget
the
importance
of
simply
being
yourself
we
are
constantly
bombarded
with
messages
and
information
from
society
and
the
media
telling
us
what
we
should
and
should
n t
do
as
a
result
many
of
us
fall
into
the
trap
of
trying
to
conform
to
expectations
in
order
to
fit
in
and
be
accepted
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
being
true
to
yourself
is
essential
for
a
happy
and
healthy
life
by
being
yourself
you
will
have
a
greater
sense
of
purpose
and
direction
in
your
life
you
are
unique
no
one
else
shares
the
same
character
traits
life
experiences
and
views
as
you
it
is
your
differences
that
make
you
unique
and
special
when
you
are
comfortable
in
your
own
skin
you
will
also
be
more
likely
to
take
on
challenging
tasks
explore
new
opportunities
and
communicate
your
needs
and
wants
with
others
in
an
effective
way
you
will
also
be
more
confident
in
your
decisions
and
have
the
courage
to
pursue
your
dreams
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
most
important
thing
is
for
you
to
stay
true
to
yourself
and
do
what
makes
you
happy
there
are
no
right
or
wrong
answers
in
life
and
you
should
not
live
your
life
according
to
anyone
else
s
expectations
by
being
yourself
you
will
be
able
to
create
a
life
worth
living
taking
classes
online
offers
students
many
advantages
as
opposed
to
attending
physical
classes
in
school
for
students
who
are
not
fond
of
attending
class
in
person
online
classes
provide
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
learn
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
students
who
take
online
classes
can
also
work
at
their
own
pace
since
they
are
not
limited
to
prescribed
class
times
classes
are
available
on
their
own
schedule
and
assignments
can
even
be
due
after
midnight
meaning
snow
days
and
other
external
factors
that
would
otherwise
cause
school
closure
have
no
effect
taking
classes
online
provides
students
with
a
convenient
option
to
work
with
their
own
schedule
and
complete
work
in
a
more
comfortable
environment
therefore
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
online
classes
have
clear
advantages
that
benefit
students
in
their
learning
process
high
goals
are
essential
in
life
and
can
help
lead
to
success
having
big
ambitions
allows
us
to
strive
for
something
greater
pushing
our
limits
and
growing
in
the
process
without
having
high
goals
our
potential
for
personal
growth
and
achievement
is
greatly
diminished
the
importance
of
having
high
goals
is
demonstrated
in
many
successful
people
s
stories
for
example
was
determined
to
become
a
successful
television
host
despite
facing
many
obstacles
in
her
personal
life
and
went
on
to
become
one
of
the
most
successful
people
in
the
entertainment
industry
similarly
innovative
vision
for
technology
pushed
him
to
create
products
and
services
that
revolutionized
the
tech
industry
on
the
other
hand
taking
low
goals
can
prevent
us
from
achieving
success
having
lower
expectations
does
not
challenge
us
to
push
our
boundaries
or
think
outside
the
box
low
goals
often
can
lead
to
complacency
which
in
turn
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
growth
stagnation
and
eventually
failure
without
the
motivation
to
strive
for
something
greater
growth
and
ultimately
success
become
difficult
to
achieve
in
conclusion
it
is
important
to
have
high
goals
in
life
as
they
can
help
to
unlock
our
true
potential
and
potential
for
success
having
high
goals
can
also
help
to
keep
us
motivated
and
focused
helping
to
avoid
any
complacency
that
might
lead
to
failure
by
taking
the
necessary
steps
and
having
a
level
of
ambition
to
attain
these
goals
we
can
set
our
sights
high
and
reach
success
for
many
being
successful
with
money
is
the
ultimate
achievement
but
beyond
the
tangible
elements
of
power
and
wealth
some
are
taking
a
different
path
to
success exploring
their
personal
desires
and
defining
themselves
without
the
influence
of
the
environment
they
have
come
to
believe
that
finding
themselves
and
understanding
who
they
are
and
what
they
want
to
accomplish
is
key
to
achieving
success
by
establishing
a
clear
purpose
for
themselves
and
dedicating
themselves
to
reaching
it
they
believe
they
have
more
of
a
chance
of
being
successful
instead
of
relying
on
external
validation
and
material
wealth
they
are
investing
in
their
own
well being
and
cultivation
of
inner confidence
discipline
and
resilience
in
essence
they
are
seeking
success
from
within
studying
from
home
via
online
videoconferencing
is
a
topic
that
sparks
much
debate
among
students
parents
and
educators
the
question
of
whether
attending
classes
from
home
is
a
favorable
method
of
study
can
be
seen
from
various
perspectives
on
one
side
differences
in
the
environment
between
attending
classes
from
home
versus
attending
classes
in
school
can
be
observed
for
example
attending
classes
from
home
allows
students
to
have
a
more
comfortable
and
relaxed
setting
which
often
comes
with
fewer
distractions
leading
to
better
focus
and
concentration
however
it
can
also
be
argued
that
being
in
a
school
setting
allows
students
to
interact
more
directly
with
their
peers
and
instructors
leading
to
a
more
effective
way
of
learning
in
regards
to
the
potential
impact
on
a
student
s
academic
performance
attending
classes
from
home
with
online
videoconferencing
has
both
pros
and
cons
while
it
provides
students
with
the
convenience
and
flexibility
to
work
at
their
own
pace
with
the
right
amount
of
personal
direction
from
the
instructor
it
also
creates
a
lack
of
human
interaction
and
social
skills
that
generally
come
with
attending
classes
in
person
overall
there
are
many
factors
that
contribute
to
a
student
s
decision
to
attend
classes
from
home
via
online
videoconferencing
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
influence
it
can
have
on
a
student
s
social
and
communication
skills
as
this
is
an
essential
part
of
their
education
while
attending
classes
from
home
can
improve
focus
and
provide
students
with
the
flexibility
to
work
at
their
own
pace
it
can
not
replicate
the
benefits
associated
with
attending
classes
in
person
such
as
human
interaction
and
social
development
ultimately
it
is
up
to
each
student
to
decide
what
is
best
for
them
and
how
they
can
benefit
from
attending
classes
from
home
excerpt
the
great
once
said
never
to
be
idle
no
person
will
have
occasion
to
complain
of
the
want
of
time
who
never
loses
any
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
this
quote
clearly
emphasizes
the
benefits
of
taking
action
instead
of
remaining
idle
in
order
to
reach
future
goals
taking
action
can
not
only
help
in
the
planning
of
future
goals
but
also
in
achieving
and
completing
them
from
setting
deadlines
to
breaking
down
tasks
into
smaller
objectives
taking
action
is
the
key
to
success
taking
action
can
also
help
in
improving
study
habits
for
those
who
are
studying
whether
it
is
through
studying
in
smaller
rounds
setting
the
time
limit
for
different
topics
and
subjects
or
in
taking
short
breaks
in between
working
actively
is
the
best
approach
to
studying
on
the
other
hand
staying
idle
may
work
for
some
individuals
however
we
need
to
take
into
consideration
that
the
results
won
t
be
as
great
as
taking
action
taking
action
is
best
when
it
comes
to
achieving
future
goals
playing
basketball

one
of
the
most
enjoyable
activities
in
the
world

of
which
are
necessary
for
the
sport
the
amount
of
physical
exercise
associated
with
playing
basketball
can
also
lead
to
improved
overall
health
finally
basketball
is
also
great
for
staying
mentally
fit
the
game

of
the
moment
and
can
benefit

mentally
all
of
these
qualities
add
up
to
make

an
enjoyable
and

activity
technology
has
changed
the
way
we
live
our
lives
from
simple
labor reducing
items
such
as
washing
machines
and
computers
to
revolutionary
communication
tools
like
the
and
smart
phones
technology
advances
have
altered
the
way
we
experience
the
world
one
of
the
most
positive
impacts
of
technology
is
the
fact
that
it
facilitates
easier
and
faster
communication
between
people
in
the
past
the
way
to
find
out
information
about
someone
or
something
was
to
do
research
however
today
we
can
find
out
almost
anything
we
want
to
know
quickly
and
even
communicate
with
people
regardless
of
distance
in
addition
even
mundane
tasks
such
as
online
banking
grocery
shopping
and
paying
bills
can
be
done
quickly
and
efficiently
without
ever
having
to
leave
the
house
unfortunately
technology
also
has
its
downsides
for
example
it
can
lead
to
an
unhealthy
sedentary
lifestyle
as
people
often
spend
large
amounts
of
time
on
the
computer
instead
of
going
outdoors
and
exercising
also
spending
too
much
time
on
digital
devices
can
result
in
damage
to
relationships
due
to
less
face to face
time
with
family
and
friends
in
addition
technology
is
creating
a
world
of
instant
gratification
which
can
lead
to
feelings
of
impatience
with
the
non digital
world
and
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
motivation
and
self regulation
overall
technology
has
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
our
lives
it
enables
us
to
work
more
efficiently
and
communicate
more
easily
however
it
can
also
lead
to
unhealthy
habits
and
an
overall
decrease
in
motivation
therefore
it
is
important
to
keep
a
balance
between
the
two
in
order
to
have
a
healthy
and
productive
lifestyle
s
quote
to
be
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
is
truly
meaningful
and
strikes
a
chord
with
many
people
in
today
s
world
one
is
constantly
bombarded
with
various
pressures
and
expectations
such
as
achieving
certain
goals
getting
into
certain
colleges
or
succeeding
in
particular
career
paths
although
these
expectations
can
be
beneficial
in
pushing
individuals
to
reach
their
goals
oftentimes
it
can
be
immensely
difficult
to
stand
out
and
remain
true
to
oneself
amidst
these
pressures
for
those
who
take
the
initiative
to
forge
their
own
path
and
not
get
trapped
by
feeling
the
need
to
be
the
same
as
everyone
else
it
is
a
great
accomplishment
for
example
deciding
to
pursue
an
unconventional
career
path
despite
the
disapproval
of
family
and
friends
or
exploring
a
side
hustle
despite
the
fear
of
failure
all
embody
this
quote
s
sentiment
it
is
a
difficult
process
but
a
rewarding
one
and
it
takes
immense
strength
and
courage
to
be
able
to
resist
the
urge
to
conform
in
a
way
s
quote
serves
as
a
reminder
that
one
should
strive
to
be
the
best
version
of
oneself
and
never
lose
sight
of
the
unique
individual
qualities
that
make
oneself
special
and
entire
at
the
same
time
it
also
serves
as
a
source
of
celebration
for
anyone
who
has
gone
through
their
own
valiant
journey
to
stay
true
to
themselves
and
their
larger
goals
in
the
face
of
challenges
our
program
seeks
to
bridge
the
generational
gap
between
older
and
younger
students
by
facilitating
collaborative
learning
and
forming
connections
to
do
this
we
start
by
introducing
students
to
each
other
in
small
groups
so
they
can
get
to
know
one
another
we
then
offer
activities
and
projects
where
teams
of
students
in
different
ages
use
their
skills
and
knowledge
to
work
together
we
also
include
fun
bonding
activities
such
as
game
nights
and
movies
where
students
can
chat
and
get
to
know
each
other
better
in
the
end
students
will
have
developed
close
friendships
and
collaborative
projects
that
they
can
be
proud
of
acting
can
be
a
very
rewarding
and
fulfilling
experience
being
in
play
can
allow
you
to
explore
different
emotions
and
roles
while
also
providing
an
opportunity
to
develop
your
acting
skills
to
become
a
successful
actor
you
must
be
dedicated
and
hardworking
in
order
to
achieve
fame
taking
on
new
roles
and
studying
how
to
approach
them
can
be
beneficial
to
your
development
as
an
actor
being
involved
in
a
play
can
also
give
you
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
satisfaction
as
you
are
able
to
share
your
talents
with
an
audience
additionally
being
in
a
play
can
be
very
beneficial
in
the
future
as
it
may
open
up
opportunities
to
act
in
other
plays
or
even
in
films
therefore
you
should
take
into
account
the
benefits
associated
with
being
in
a
play
and
how
it
could
help
you
reach
your
goals
attending
public
school
and
online
or
home
school
both
have
their
unique
advantages
public
school
offers
a
traditional
classroom
setting
with
teachers
who
can
provide
guidance
and
support
to
students
with
the
classroom
setting
students
also
benefit
from
interacting
with
their
peers
and
forming
relationships
with
their
classmates
on
the
other
hand
online
or
home
school
can
offer
more
flexibility
allowing
students
to
manage
their
own
schedules
and
workloads
in
addition
home
or
online
school
can
provide
access
to
specialized
classes
and
resources
that
may
not
be
offered
in
a
public
school
setting
ultimately
the
right
choice
for
a
student
ultimately
depends
on
their
preferred
learning
style
and
what
is
most
suitable
for
their
individual
needs
starting
a
business
provides
a
unique
opportunity
to
become
a
master
of
a
particular
industry
for
example
a
person
who
starts
a
catering
business
can
become
a
master
chef
able
to
create
delicious
dishes
and
efficiently
run
a
successful
catering
business
gaining
mastery
in
a
specific
business
area
is
beneficial
in
that
a
person
can
become
an
authority
in
a
particular
field
however
another
approach
a
business
owner
might
take
is
to
take
on
multiple
tasks
and
grow
through
experience
for
example
a
restaurant
owner
might
gain
knowledge
and
experience
related
to
real
estate
food
sourcing
marketing
and
personnel
by
taking
on
roles
outside
of
the
core
business
skills
the
restaurant
owner
can
gain
knowledge
in
a
variety
of
areas
knowledge
which
can
in
turn
lead
to
more
creative
and
innovative
ideas
it
is
important
for
a
business
owner
to
stay
on
top
of
knowledge
and
experiences
related
to
their
business
in
order
to
remain
diverse
and
competitive
wrote
not
go
where
the
path
may
lead
go
instead
where
there
is
no
path
and
leave
a
trail
in
business
it
is
important
to
think
outside
the
box
to
develop
ideas
and
create
solutions
that
are
unique
and
innovative
learning
as
much
as
possible
in
a
variety
of
fields
is
the
key
to
survival
and
success

the

any

they
face
the
debate
over
reducing
work
hours
for
school
teachers
is
one
that
has
caused
much
contention
in
recent
years
on
the
surface
it
appears
to
be
a
reasonable
notion
reducing
the
hours
teachers
spend
in
the
classroom
would
limit
their
exposure
to
stress
and
provide
more
leisure
time
however
this
decision
carries
many
far reaching
implications
that
ultimately
make
such
a
move
inadvisable
and
foremost
reducing
teacher
work
hours
would
likely
result
in
an
increase
in
class
sizes
this
would
lead
to
an
overall
decrease
in
the
quality
of
education
provided
as
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
for
a
teacher
to
manage
a
larger
number
of
students
it
would
also
add
additional
strain
on
teachers
who
would
be
responsible
for
teaching
more
material
to
a
larger
class
in
reduced
time
frames
in
addition
fewer
teacher
work
hours
could
lead
to
the
primary
instructors
being
asked
to
take
on
additional
roles
in
the
school
such
as
extracurricular
activities
and
guidance
support
this
would
detract
from
the
crucial
educational
focuses
of
their
role
and
could
lead
to
compromising
standards
as
they
would
now
be
trying
to
manage
more
complex
tasks
in
fewer
work
hours
lastly
reducing
the
amount
of
time
teachers
spend
in
the
classroom
could
unintentionally
devalue
the
profession
as
a
whole
teachers
dedicate
a
great
deal
of
time
to
their
work
and
by
painting
it
as
something
that
can
be
accomplished
in
a
short
amount
of
time
we
risk
giving
the
impression
that
it
is
a
less
worthy
profession
worth
less
than
those
requiring
more
working
hours
for
these
reasons
reducing
work
hours
for
school
teachers
is
not
a
wise
decision
while
it
may
provide
teachers
with
greater
leisure
time
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
implications
and
maintain
the
respect
and
integrity
due
to
the
education
system
in
his
famous
statement
declared
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
speaks
to
the
important
role
that
failure
can
play
in
the
pursuit
of
success
a
notion
that
is
especially
relevant
for
esl
students
has
found
that
for
students
failure
can
be
a
beneficial
experience
if
accepted
and
used
properly
through
trial
and
error
students
can
learn
how
to
best
achieve
their
goals
while
also
gaining
greater
self confidence
it
can
also
help
them
become
better
problem
solvers
and
effective
communicators
further
preparing
them
for
future
success
research
also
suggests
that
setting
realistic
expectations
for
students
and
allowing
them
to
make
mistakes
go
a
long
way
in
fostering
their
confidence
and
resilience
thus
as
pointed
out
it
is
the
courage
to
accept
and
learn
from
failure
that
leads
to
eventual
success
when
attempting
to
achieve
a
goal
most
of
us
are
motivated
by
personal
success
and
the
fulfillment
of
our
ambitions
was
one
of
the
most
driven
historical
figures
of
our
time
and
he
never
shied
away
from
a
challenge
his
philosophy
to
accomplishment
was
simple
yet
effective
set
a
goal
plan
out
the
steps
it
would
take
to
reach
that
goal
and
relentlessly
pursue
it
until
success
was
achieved
he
recognized
that
obstacles
were
inevitable
and
that
the
path
toward
success
might
be
a
long
and
marked
with
pitfalls
but
he
persevered
until
he
accomplished
his
goals
today
there
are
various
strategies
that
we
can
use
to
effectively
accomplish
a
goal
such
as
breaking
it
down
into
manageable
steps
identifying
realistic
deadlines
and
staying
motivated
by
celebrating
small
milestones
along
the
way
there
will
always
be
challenges
that
stand
in
our
way
such
as
large
workloads
financial
barriers
and
lack
of
time
however
it
is
possible
to
overcome
any
obstacle
if
we
are
persistent
and
remain
positive
to
illustrate
the
potential
for
success
there
are
countless
success
stories
of
people
who
have
managed
to
accomplish
difficult
goals
from
completing
college
while
facing
financial
hardship
to
earning
a
six figure
salary
these
stories
can
provide
inspiration
and
fuel
our
ambition
it
is
proof
that
anything
is
possible
if
we
set
our
minds
to
it
in
drafting
an
outline
for
my
essay
i
will
focus
on
how
to
best
accomplish
goals
as
well
as
why
it
is
important
to
stay
motivated
i
will
use
multiple
sources
to
illustrate
the
potential
success
stories
while
also
discussing
potential
obstacles
and
how
to
handle
them
my
essay
will
ultimately
emphasize
the
courage
and
drive
that
it
takes
to
accomplish
goals
and
ultimately
capture
success
having
a
positive
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
determining
success
in
life
numerous
studies
have
shown
that
those
who
view
life
optimistically
find
greater
success
in
work
relationships
and
overall
life
satisfaction
it
s
easy
to
find
examples
of
people
who
did
n t
have
a
positive
attitude
and
were
n t
successful
in
their
endeavors
however
many
case
studies
point
to
the
success
of
those
with
positive
attitudes
who
are
able
to
weather
life
s
challenging
moments
those
who
tout
the
benefits
of
a
positive
attitude
are
not
wrong
security
of
oneself
and
acceptance
of
life
s
challenges
are
all
key
components
of
a
successful
life
that
can
only
be
accessed
when
one
has
a
positive
outlook
by
having
a
positive
attitude
one
can
approach
challenging
situations
with
optimism
and
a
vision
to
improve
they
can
also
forgive
themselves
quickly
when
they
make
mistakes
and
be
content
with
their
lives
no
matter
what
life
throws
at
them
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
is
indispensable
in
life
it
helps
one
become
emotionally
resilient
and
allows
them
to
use
life
s
difficulties
as
learning
experiences
while
still
being
optimistic
about
the
future
this
attitude
is
necessary
for
those
who
value
success
in
any
aspect
of
their
life
and
those
who
perceive
negative
attitudes
as
more
beneficial
are
simply
mistaken
the
family
and
society
we
are
born
into
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
our
ability
to
make
life
decisions
family
values
beliefs
and
attitudes
are
often
passed
down
through
generations
and
can
strongly
influence
our
choices
meanwhile
society
s
expectations
norms
and
stigmas
can
also
shape
our
decisions
this
can
be
particularly
true
for
those
with
traditionally
marginalized
identities
who

has
become
an
increasingly
popular
form
of
education
in
recent
years
providing
students
of
all
ages
around
the
world
with
countless
benefits
the
cost
benefits
access
to
education
and
differing
levels
of
educational
assistance
are
just
some
of
the
advantages
of
distance
learning
that
make
it
an
attractive
option
for
starters
distance

can
be
significantly
less
expensive
than
traditional

as
more
resources
and
educational
materials
move
online
students
have
access
to
a
wider
array
of
courses
at
cheaper
prices
and
with
the
convenience
of

as
an
added
bonus
students
often
have
access
to
courses
and
universities
that
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
them
due
to
location
or
financial
restrictions
another
advantage
of
distance
learning
is
its
ability
to
provide
educational
opportunities
to
those
who
would
not
otherwise
have
access
many
students
around
the
world
are
still
unable
to
access
traditional
education
due
to
various
limitations
but
distance
learning
provides
them
with
the
chance
to
learn
and
contribute
to
the
global
education
system
without
needing
to
attend
a
physical
campus

distance
learning
can
provide
a
wide
range
of
educational
assistance
for
students
of
all
ages
and
backgrounds
this
could
include
additional
support
for
those
who
require
special
needs
assistance
online
tutoring
and
guidance
on
various
topics
that
students
may
find
challenging
overall
distance
learning
has
opened
up
more
opportunities
for
students
around
the
world
and
offers
numerous
benefits
that
would
not
be
available
with
traditional
education
from
cost
savings
to
access
to
education
and
varying
levels
of
educational
assistance
all
made
possible
through
distance
learning
today
s
students
have
access
to
a
world
of
possibilities
my
school
offers
a
unique
distance
learning
program
that
allows
students
to
study
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
it
provides
flexible
learning
opportunities
for
many
students
who
ca
n t
access
traditional
schools
such
as
those
who
have
medical
conditions
live
far
away
from
the
school
or
have
other
commitments
that
prevent
them
from
attending
classes
in
person
learning
involves
online
classes
and
video
conferencing
both
of
which
offer
their
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
compared
to
attending
classes
in
person
for
instance
online
classes
can
be
easy
to
access
at
any
time
of
day
and
from
any
location
but
they
can
also
lack
the
active
learning
environment
of
a
traditional
classroom
setting
conferencing
can
improve
access
to
a
more
engaging
learning
environment
compared
to
online
classes
but
its
success
often
depends
on
having
the
right
online
tools
and
reliable
internet
connections
i
once
took
an
online
class
through
the
distance
learning
program
while
also
attending
classes
in
person
the
online
course
allowed
me
to
work
through
the
material
at
my
own
pace
and
it
provided
me
ample
opportunities
to
connect
with
other
students
in
real time
to
ask
questions
and
get
feedback
this
flexibility
facilitated
and
challenged
my
learning
more
than
if
i
just
attended
classes
in
person
overall
i
believe
the
distance
learning
program
offered
by
my
school
is
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
supplement
their
education
while
balancing
other
commitments
it
supports
a
learning
environment
that
is
more
personalized
and
independent
yet
still
connected
to
the
resources
and
people
of
a
school
setting
reading
books
has
been
found
to
offer
many
benefits
for
a
variety
of
different
groups
for
example
kids
who
read
for
enjoyment
show
better
academic
performance
and
develop
better
critical
thinking
skills
moreover
adults
who
read
for
educational
or
professional
purposes
are
also
likely
to
improve
their
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
topic
elderly
people
who
read
non fiction
books
increase
their
overall
psychological
wellbeing
and
reduce
their
stress
levels
playing
sports
and
watching
games
can
both
offer
different
advantages
playing
sports
offers
the
potential
for
physical
exercise
the
opportunity
to
learn
and
improve
skills
and
the
chance
to
build
meaningful
connections
with
peers
watching
games
on
the
other
hand
allows
people
to
be
more
passive
observers
of
the
action
and
can
bring
them
closer
together
with
others
who
share
their
passion
for
the
same
sport
people

many
reasons
and
in
several
different
environments

takes
place
in

a
wide
selection
while

for
luxury
items

happens
in

of

many
benefits
both
for

experience
located
in
the
heart
of
the
park

a
dizzying
array
of
attractions
roller
coasters
and
things
to

still
remember
the
feeling
of
stepping

the
lush
greenery
of
the
parklands
filled
with
a
diverse
array
of
trees
and
plants
riding
the
wooden
rollercoaster
with
its
thrilling
turns
made
my
heart
pound
and
the
screams
of
joy
ringing
through
the
air

like
music
from
the
wheel
spinning
in
the
sky
to
the

down
a
hill
there
s
something
for
everyone
at
after
a
full
day
i
felt
energized
and
refreshed
and
could
not
wait
to
come
back
each
time
i
return
i
m
filled
with
the
same
wonder
and
excitement
i
had
the
first
time
i
visited
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
one
of
the
main
pros
of
having
high
school
students
identify
their
career
paths
is
that
it
allows
them
to
make
informed
decisions
about
their
future
by
choosing
a
career
path
students
are
empowered
to
select
classes
and
extracurricular
activities
that
best
suit
their
chosen
field
of
study
this
can
help
prepare
them
for
college
and
their
career
goals
however
there
can
be
some
downsides
to
having
high
school
students
make
decisions
about
their
future
for
some
students
the
pressure
of
making
a
career
choice
can
be
overwhelming
and
can
lead
to
anxiety
and
stress
additionally
a
career
choice
at
an
early
age
can
put
pressure
on
students
to
excel
and
meet
certain
standards
resulting
in
increased
levels
of
stress
while
having
high
school
students
identify
their
career
paths
can
have
positive
effects
there
can
also
be
some
negative
repercussions
it
s
important
to
think
carefully
about
the
potential
consequences
before
making
a
final
decision
regarding
this
issue
after
conducting
extensive
research
it
became
evident
that
participating
in
this
program
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
both
younger
and
older
students
for
younger
students
they
could
gain
a
vast
array
of
skills
and
knowledge
such
as
improved
communication
and
teamwork
skills
enhanced
problem solving
abilities
and
the
confidence
to
step
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
for
older
students
the
program
could
provide
a
great
opportunity
for
mentorship
leadership
and
potentially
career
and
professional
development
additionally
by
participating
in
the
program
there
could
be
substantial
improvements
in
behaviors
socialization
and
responsibility
in
both
the
younger
and
older
students
finally
this
program
could
also
have
positive
economic
implications
by
creating
employment
opportunities
in
the
local
community
and
providing
students
with
the
skills
necessary
to
be
successful
in
their
future
studies
and
careers
influence
both
positive
and
negative
is
an
unavoidable
element
of
human
interaction
positive
influence
exists
when
people
are
uplifted
and
encouraged
to
accomplish
goals
or
achieve
desired
behaviors
for
example
a
parent
conveying
to
a
child
praise
or
words
of
support
this
can
be
an
invaluable
tool
in
helping
individuals
develop
their
potential
negative
influence
meanwhile
can
manifest
as
manipulation
coercion
or
in
cases
of
severe
power
inequity
even
physical
mental
or
emotional
abuse
these
can
be
particularly
damaging
as
people
can
be
coerced
into
damaging
or
dangerous
behaviors
that
have
both
immediate
and
long term
consequences
that
can
be
detrimental
to
their
well being
the
impact
of
influence
on
people
can
be
far reaching
positive
influence
can
provide
people
with
the
confidence
and
motivation
to
pursue
opportunities
in
life
and
strive
for
success
conversely
negative
influence
can
be
incredibly
destructive
resulting
in
patterns
of
unhealthy
behavior
low
self esteem
and
disastrous
decision making
for
this
reason
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
dangers
of
negative
influence
and
the
power
of
positive
influence
one
famous
quote
by
that
relates
to
the
challenge
of
setting
goals
in
modern
society
is
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
this
quote
speaks
to
the
difficulty
of
knowing
our
own
limits
when
it
comes
to
setting
goals
it
is
often
difficult
to
accurately
gauge
our
own
abilities
and
comparing
them
with
the
goals
that
we
set
for
ourselves
if
we
set
goals
that
are
too
difficult
we
may
become
frustrated
and
unhappy
with
our
position
but
if
we
set
goals
that
are
too
easy
we
may
become
complacent
and
never
strive
for
improvement
setting
both
easy
and
hard
goals
can
be
beneficial
as
it
challenges
us
to
continuously
work
towards
personal
growth
and
development
for
example
if
someone
wished
to
become
a
professional
musician
setting
easier
goals
such
as
learning
chords
or
chords
progressions
can
provide
the
necessary
foundation
while
still
inspiring
them
to
eventually
reach
their
goal
setting
easy
goals
can
create
a
scaffolding
that
will
help
to
eventually
create
a
larger
structure
thus
by
setting
both
easy
and
hard
goals
and
knowing
our
limits
we
can
consistently
strive
for
greater
heights
one
of
the
greatest
aspects
of
the
human
condition
is
our
capacity
for
imagination
without
imagination
knowledge
is
not
only
static
but
limited
imagination
is
the
driving
force
behind
the
advancement
of
humanity
because
without
it
progress
would
be
impossible
in
our
daily
life
imagination
plays
a
critical
role
in
every
decision
we
make
and
every
idea
we
conceive
from
selecting
the
right
job
to
supporting
our
family
our
imagination
gives
us
the
capacity
to
create
scenarios
and
visualize
the
outcomes
of
various
actions
this
ability
to
creatively
explore
alternatives
allows
us
to
develop
informed
strategies
based
on
our
own
inner
wisdom
without
our
imagination
we
would
be
stuck
in
an
unchangeable
world
unable
to
adapt
to
the
knowledge
of
the
present
put
imagination
is
a
fundamental
element
of
knowledge
after
weeks
of
research
i
ve
decided
that
becoming
a
forensic
scientist
would
be
a
suitable
and
fulfilling
career
for
me
every
day
would
bring
a
chance
to
make
a
difference
and
aid
in
bringing
justice
to
those
who
have
suffered
injustice
additionally
after
researching
the
police
force
i
have
come
to
appreciate
the
many
instances
where
they
have
put
their
own
safety
on
the
line
in
order
to
ensure
the
safety
of
people
property
and
justice
itself
i
am
inspired
by
their
courage
and
know
that
i
can
make
a
difference
in
the
same
way
with
that
in
mind
i
feel
that
by
becoming
a
forensic
scientist
i
can
make
a
positive
contribution
to
society
and
help
others
in
a
meaningful
way
moreover
i
am
hopeful
for
my
future
and
i
am
actively
working
to
make
the
world
a
brighter
and
more
just
place
adopting
a
pm
weekday
curfew
and
a
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
is
an
important
step
for
ensuring
that
young
people
have
safe
and
enjoyable
lives
having
fixed
times
to
be
home
helps
to
protect
teenagers
from
the
dangerous
activities
that
take
place
after
dark
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
more
serious
criminal
behavior
examples
of
the
types
of
trouble
that
can
be
avoided
include
theft
drug
use
alcohol
consumption
and
harm
to
oneself
or
someone
else
having
a
curfew
also
teaches
teens
how
to
manage
their
time
responsibly
it
reinforces
the
idea
that
there
are
certain
tasks
or
behaviors
that
have
specific
deadlines
such
as
being
ready
for
school
in
the
morning
or
doing
homework
by
a
given
time
additionally
it
serves
as
an
impetus
for
teenagers
to
use
their
free
time
productively
as
many
may
find
themselves
wanting
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
daylight
hours
before
having
to
be
home
obeying
the
curfew
law
is
an
important
step
in
creating
a
society
in
which
young
people
lead
safe
and
respected
lives
firstly
teens
will
be
reducing
their
risk
of
involvement
in
negative
activities
providing
a
sense
of
safety
and
security
secondly
by
following
the
law
teenagers
learn
the
importance
of
valuing
the
authority
of
their
parents
and
elders
as
well
as
understanding
the
rules
of
society
in
summation
adopting
a
pm
weekday
curfew
and
a
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
is
an
essential
step
to
ensure
that
young
people
are
cared
for
and
protected
such
a
law
would
help
teenagers
stay
safe
manage
their
time
responsibly
and
respect
the
authority
of
adults
s
quote
your
character
will
be
what
you
choose
to
make
it
speaks
to
our
personal
choice
to
construct
and
define
our
own
character
we
may
rely
on
external
influences
to
create
certain
expectations
and
beliefs
but
ultimately
we
shape
our
own
personality
it
is
important
to
have
a
unique
identity
rather
than
be
monotonous
as
it
encourages
self expression
growth
and
personal
power
when
individuals
build
their
own
personalities
it
promotes
a
sense
of
liberation
creativity
and
overall
healthier
relationships
moreover
having
your
own
identity
encourages
others
to
see
you
as
a
strong
capable
individual
that
they
can
trust
and
respect
to
conclude
developing
our
own
personality
is
essential
in
order
to
reach
our
highest
potential
and
to
find
our
true
identity
and
sense
of
authenticity
you
have
the
power
to
take
control
of
your
character
and
create
the
life
you
want it
all
begins
with
you
it
is
clear
that
attending
classes
from
home
has
considerable
advantages
for
students
to
begin
with
it
allows
adults
with
responsibilities
at
home
such
as
childcare
to
attend
classes
without
having
to
leave
their
family
similarly
students
with
anxiety
who
are
unable
to
focus
or
face
performance
issues
in
the
classroom
environment
could
take
classes
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
the
lack
of
distractions
such
as
other
students
shuffling
and
talking
potentially
gives
them
an
advantage
in
completing
the
work
with
greater
attention
to
detail
the
benefit
of
doing
the
class
work
anywhere
including
on
the
go
lends
a
great
measure
of
convenience
to
a
student
s
already busy
lifestyle
in
conclusion
there
are
a
number
of
advantages
for
students
attending
classes
from
home
it
provides
flexibility
and
convenience
while
also
allowing
for
a
more
focused
working
environment
for
those
who
struggle
with
classroom
settings
in
recent
years
public
school
systems
have
been
forced
to
make
difficult
decisions
regarding
the
budget
allocated
to
school
sports
teams
in
order
to
maximize
the
impact
of
available
resources
many
schools
are
turning
to
a
potential
new
policy
that
would
provide
equal
access
for
all
students
who
wish
to
participate
in
sports
programs
while
recognizing
that
not
all
students
are
competitive
athletes
from
the
student
perspective
the
new
policy
would
be
advantageous
in
that
it
could
potentially
provide
more
opportunities
to
develop
communication
and
teamwork
skills
while
also
teaching
the
value
of
healthy
competition
additionally
the
policy
could
increase
school
participation
and
engagement
among
students
who
are
less
athletically
inclined
thus
boosting
morale
and
school
spirit
on
the
other
hand
the
policy
could
place
a
strain
on
school
budgets
due
to
the
need
for
additional
facilities
and
equipment
moreover
the
policy
could
also
take
away
from
essential
resources
such
as
teacher
salaries
and
classroom
materials
teachers
may
find
it
difficult
to
provide
equal
attention
and
motivation
to
all
athletes
ultimately
the
new
policy
could
potentially
benefit
some
schools
resulting
in
increased
school
spirit
and
greater
access
to
sports
however
the
disadvantages
should
be
carefully
considered
before
instituting
such
a
policy
educational
activities
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
outcomes
when
it
comes
to
learning
socializing
and
making
friends
on
the
one
hand
participating
in
educational
activities
can
have
a
range
of
benefits
it
can
develop
important
communication
and
team building
skills
promote
problem solving
abilities
and
foster
creativity
and
critical
thinking
in
addition
these
activities
can
be
a
great
way
to
make
friends
and
broaden
social
networks
however
working
with
a
team
or
group
of
people
can
present
its
own
set
of
challenges
disagreements
and
arguments
are
common
and
it
can
be
difficult
for
everyone
to
share
an
opinion
without
offending
someone
else
in
order
to
manage
these
differences
it
is
important
to
agree
on
a
few
ground
rules
in
advance
these
could
include
respecting
individual
points
of
view
having
an
open
and
honest
discussion
where
every
opinion
is
heard
and
communicating
clearly
with
each
other
setting
these
boundaries
can
help
ensure
that
educational
activities
can
be
a
positive
and
rewarding
experience
after
months
of
research
and
soul searching
i
have
finally
decided
that
becoming
a
doctor
and
more
specifically
a
surgeon
is
the
right
career
path
for
me
i
ve
read
countless
books
about
doctors
to
understand
the
profession
better
and
i
ve
read
books
about
surgeries
to
understand
this
specialization
further
i
was
also
able
to
talk
to
my
uncle
a
doctor
to
learn
more
about
his
experience
and
gain
valuable
insight
the
journey
ahead
will
be
challenging
and
at
times
difficult
but
i
am
prepared
to
work
hard
and
make
sacrifices
to
pursue
this
dream
i
am
also
aware
of
the
immense
financial
benefits
of
being
a
doctor
and
understand
that
this
can
sometimes
be
a
motivation
to
continue
all
in
all
i
am
sure
that
this
is
the
right
career
path
for
me
art
classes
should
not
be
a
requirement
for
students
electives
provide
a
more
vibrant
and
diverse
learning
experience
than
a
mandatory
class
could
allowing
students
to
explore
the
topics
they
are
most
interested
in
by
taking
electives
students
have
more
freedom
to
indulge
their
passions
and
interests
increasing
their
enjoyment
of
the
school
experience
electives
can
offer
valuable
real world
insights
such
as
career
counseling
which
prepares
them
for
their
future
making
art
classes
a
requirement
would
deprive
students
of
creative
freedom
which
often
leads
to
higher
engagement
and
enthusiasm
for
the
subject
while
studying
an
art
form
can
be
rewarding
and
should
be
encouraged
forcing
it
on
students
may
leave
them
feeling
overwhelmed
unmotivated
and
detracts
from
their
enjoyment
of
the
school
experience
additionally
making
art
classes
a
requirement
would
limit
students
ability
to
choose
other
highly
educational
pre professional
courses
which
can
help
them
become
prepared
for
the
job
market
in
conclusion
electives
provide
a
more
diverse
stimulating
and
enjoyable
learning
experience
than
mandatory
art
classes
furthermore
making
art
classes
a
requirement
would
not
be
beneficial
to
students
in
the
future
due
to
a
lack
of
freedom
and
educational
depth
in
studying
the
subject
therefore
art
classes
should
not
be
mandatory
for
students
i
spent
my
week
visiting
different
modeling
companies
to
learn
more
about
the
industry
at
each
one
i
spoke
to
the
professionals
and
took
a
tour
to
understand
the
behind the scenes
process
of
what
it
takes
to
become
a
model
i
even
took
part
in
some
of
the
lessons
such
as
learning
how
to
properly
walk
the
runway
and
how
to
pose
for
pictures
i
practiced
showing
off
clothing
and
other
materials
that
models
often
wear
and
how
to
best
showcase
them
while
conveying
the
right
attitude
it
was
an
invaluable
experience
that
gave
me
an
in depth
understanding
of
how
the
fashion
modeling
world
works
in
recent
years
technology
has
been
a
great
aid
to
humans
in
limiting
contact
with
one
another
especially
during
times
of
change
or
crisis
such
use
has
helped
to
improve
physical
and
mental
health
for
individuals
around
the
globe
as
people
limit
their
contact
with
each
other
they
limit
their
exposure
to
external
factors
that
may
disrupt
their
daily
lives
those
who
participate
in
online
social
networks
are
capable
of
maintaining
meaningful
connections
without
the
need
to
congregate
in
person
allowing
them
to
stay
safe
and
secure
also
allows
users
to
keep
up to date
on
world
news
individuals
can
regularly
read
about
or
watch
news
broadcasts
that
update
them
with
the
most
recent
information
about
news
and
events
this
helps
them
stay
informed
without
having
to
constantly
interact
with
other
people
furthermore
technology
can
help
create
an
awareness
of
how
news
and
events
in
the
world
can
affect
individuals
personally
making
them
more
cognizant
of
their
environments
the
use
of
technology
to
limit
human
contact
has
brought
a
positive
impact
on
physical
and
mental
health
as
well
as
providing
important
information
about
the
world
it
has
enabled
people
to
lead
more
efficient
safer
and
ultimately
healthier
lives
in
my
opinion
adding
an
extra
half
hour
to
the
school
day
would
not
be
beneficial
for
students
firstly
it
would
be
detrimental
to
our
families
into
the
already
limited
time
our
families
have
together
an
extra
half
hour
of
school
would
be
an
unnecessary
strain
this
would
affect
students
of
all
ages
from
kindergarteners
who
need
their
parents
attention
to
teenagers
balancing
work
and
school
making
parenting
and
family
time
much
more
difficult
moreover
an
additional
half
hour
would
directly
interfere
with
student athletes
schedules
any
extra
time
spent
in
the
classroom
would
be
time
away
from
practices
conditioning
or
participating
in
games
the
extra
half
hour
would
make
it
increasingly
difficult
to
not
only
keep
up
in
school
but
to
also
support
their
team
both
physically
and
mentally
furthermore
it
would
be
a
hassle
to
quickly
squeeze
in
doctor
s
appointments
or
any
other
obligations
students
may
have
after
school
having
just
thirty
minutes
extra
wouldn
t
be
enough
time
to
travel
to
appointments
so
students
would
have
to
miss
class
or
find
a
new
doctor
song
slot
finally
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
school
day
is
already
long
enough
student
life
obligations
and
homework
students
have
already
committed
much
of
their
time
to
education
asking
for
an
additional
half
hour
of
their
day
would
be
taxing
both
mentally
and
physically
in
conclusion
an
extra
half
hour
of
school
would
not
be
beneficial
for
students
and
i
am
opposed
to
the
school
board
making
this
decision
the
advent
of
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
world
and
the
way
humans
live
in
the
modern
era
it
has
provided
numerous
benefits
from
improved
communication
to
quick
and
easy
access
to
information
through
advances
in
medical
technology
diseases
can
be
detected
and
treated
and
lives
saved
however
technology
can
also
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
world
distractions
such
as
video
games
and
social
media
can
lead
to
increased
time
spent
on
screens
reducing
physical
activity
and
leading
to
poor
physical
and
mental
health
moreover
problems
such
as
data
breaches
and
identity
theft
can
befall
those
who
are
careless
with
their
technology
it
is
important
to
consider
how
to
manage
technology
responsibly
individuals
should
take
steps
to
protect
their
data
such
as
ensuring
device
security
settings
are
enabled
they
should
also
set
limits
on
how
much
time
they
and
their
families
spend
using
technology
by
limiting
media
exposure
or
setting
time
limits
overall
technology
has
drastically
changed
our
world
and
society
it
is
beneficial
in
communication
getting
information
and
providing
medical
care
among
other
aspects
to
make
the
most
of
the
opportunities
it
presents
it
must
be
managed
responsibly
by
understanding
the
potential
positives
and
negatives
individuals
can
use
technology
in
a
way
that
allows
them
to
benefit
from
its
advantages
while
avoiding
the
drawbacks
after
reviewing
several
studies
on
the
pros
and
cons
of
requiring
students
to
do
community
service
it
appears
that
the
primary
concern
is
the
potential
impact
on
academic
performance
the
students
may
be
so
focused
on
completing
the
service
requirements
that
they
neglect
to
focus
enough
time
and
energy
on
their
studies
however
community
service
can
also
teach
valuable
life
lessons
such
as
compassion
empathy
collaboration
and
communication
which
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
academic
performance
a
potential
solution
to
this
issue
would
be
to
allow
students
to
choose
the
type
and
amount
of
community
service
they
take
part
in
by
allowing
students
to
customize
their
service
they
can
optimize
their
time
to
ensure
both
their
academic
and
personal
needs
are
met
additionally
this
solution
would
empower
students
to
serve
their
community
in
a
way
that
suits
their
interests
and
passions
finally
the
government
should
provide
incentives
for
students
who
choose
to
do
community
service
beyond
the
required
minimum
such
as
scholarship
and
volunteer
awards
by
formulating
this
solution
students
community
and
government
can
all
benefit
changing
the
school
menu
can
be
a
controversial
topic
as
it
has
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
the
one
hand
it
is
undeniable
that
nutrition
is
important
especially
for
growing
children
introducing
a
more
varied
and
balanced
menu
would
offer
students
the
proper
assortment
of
nutrients
needed
for
a
healthy
lifestyle
additionally
children
are
more
likely
to
taste
new
foods
when
their
peers
are
trying
them
as
well
this
could
help
students
be
more
adventurous
eaters
resulting
in
healthier
long term
dietary
habits
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
risk
of
unfamiliar
foods
being
met
with
negative
responses
many
students
resist
change
and
may
be
unwilling
to
try
new
meals
particularly
those
which
are
not
part
of
their
culture
or
personal
likes
furthermore
the
cost
of
introducing
higher quality
ingredients
may
put
financial
strain
on
families
especially
those
whose
budgets
are
already
stretched
thin
finally
dining
hall
staff
may
need
additional
training
to
prepare
the
food
resulting
in
additional
expenses
in
conclusion
while
changing
the
school
menu
has
the
potential
to
bring
multiple
benefits
to
students
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
as
well
ultimately
the
decision
of
whether
to
proceed
with
changing
the
school
menu
must
be
the
result
of
careful
deliberation
and
research
on
the
topic
showing
small
acts
of
kindness
to
others
can
have
a
multitude
of
positive
effects
acting
kindly
towards
others
can
improve
a
person
s
attitude
make
someone
s
day
brighter
and
can
help
a
person
going
through
difficult
times
can
also
result
in
personal
growth
for
the
individual
showing
kindness
allowing
them
to
become
a
better
person
through
the
act
of
giving
back
when
someone
is
shown
kindness
it
can
help
to
alleviate
emotional
burdens
as
it
offers
encouragement
and
understanding
it
can
have
a
similar
impact
on
someone
who
is
showing
kindness
providing
them
with
a
sense
of
fulfillment
and
satisfaction
overall
showing
small
acts
of
kindness
towards
others
can
be
highly
beneficial
for
both
parties
creating
shared
emotional
connections
and
making
the
world
a
better
place
creating
a
new
substance
from
chemicals
is
a
complex
process
that
requires
extensive
research
one
must
understand
the
chemical
composition
of
different
substances
and
learn
the
specific
names
of
chemical
compounds
once
knowledge
is
attained
experiments
can
be
conducted
in
a
lab
to
test
different
chemical
reactions
the
benefits
of
trial
and
error
far
outweigh
the
risks
and
the
potential
for
creating
something
incredibly
valuable
is
infinite
my
summer
project
revolves
around
discovering
ways
to
treat
an
open
wound
without
the
use
of
pharmaceuticals
or
medical
treatments
i
believe
that
by
researching
natural
remedies
such
as
utilizing
the
healing
properties
found
in
certain
plants
we
can
reduce
our
reliance
on
antibiotics
this
project
could
be
used
in
everyday
life
for
example
a
family
member
or
friend
that
has
suffered
an
open
wound
could
treat
it
using
the
natural
remedies
researched
in
this
project
the
remedies
could
also
be
useful
in
developing
nations
where
medical
treatments
and
pharmaceuticals
are
often
difficult
to
come
by
in
addition
the
natural
remedies
could
be
useful
in
a
natural
disaster
situation
when
access
to
medical
care
may
be
limited
overall
this
project
is
about
finding
safe
and
non invasive
treatments
for
open
wounds
and
reducing
our
reliance
on
antibiotics
imagination
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
elevate
us
beyond
the
limits
of
knowledge
and
what
is
already
known
we
may
not
be
able
to
physically
materialize
our
imaginations
in
the
same
way
we
can
facts
but
we
can
use
them
to
explore
new
ideas
that
would
otherwise
be
off limits
we
can
use
imagination
to
bring
joy
to
create
works
of
art
and
entertainment
and
to
spark
innovative
thinking
that
can
produce
groundbreaking
products
and
inventions
on
a
personal
level
i
have
often
used
imagination
to
take
a
deeper
look
at
the
world
around
me
through
imagining
what
life
would
be
like
in
different
situations
and
scenarios
i
developed
a
better
understanding
of
various
contexts
and
the
implications
of
the
decisions
i
have
made
having
an
imagination
has
also
enabled
me
to
think
of
ideas
for
movies
seasonal
decorations
and
physical
products
that
i
otherwise
would
not
have
considered
ultimately
imagination
is
an
invaluable
asset
that
can
make
the
seemingly
impossible
achievable
without
it
we
would
never
know
the
joy
of
discovering
something
that
we
did
not
expect
or
the
satisfaction
of
having
a
unique
solution
to
a
problem
as
we
continue
to
explore
the
capabilities
of
our
imagination
the
possibilities
will
continue
to
multiply
and
open
up
new
paths
that
may
have
previously
seemed
out
of
reach
i
ve
set
an
ambitious
goal
for
myself
playing
on
a
professional
soccer
team
such
as
and
representing
my
country
in
international
matches
i
m
determined
to
work
hard
and
make
this
dream
a
reality
i
m
researching
the
best
ways
to
improve
my
strength
and
agility
so
i
can
become
a
reliable
and
successful
player
i
m
striving
to
be
the
player
who
will
bring
joy
and
success
to
my
country
by
winning
the
my
focus
now
is
on
training
and
developing
myself
to
become
the
best
player
i
can
be
students
should
not
be
required
to
take
classes
in
arts
music
or
drama
for
a
variety
of
reasons
to
begin
these
classes
often
require
special
resources
and
materials
which
can
be
expensive
for
parents
and
schools
alike
additionally
students
come
from
different
backgrounds
and
interests
and
should
have
the
freedom
to
choose
the
classes
which
best
suit
them
while
many
people
believe
that
such
classes
can
help
to
develop
creativity
this
development
may
be
more
easily
obtained
through
activities
and
educational
opportunities
outside
of
the
classroom
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
individual
student
to
decide
how
to
best
spend
their
time
and
energy
forcing
students
to
take
arts
music
or
drama
classes
may
lead
to
a
lack
of
engagement
or
even
resentment
and
both
can
be
harmful
to
the
learning
process
instead
educators
should
offer
advice
on
which
classes
to
take
as
a
supplement
to
other
studies
in
order
to
build
a
well rounded
education
school
offers
several
advantages
when
compared
to
traditional
in person
schooling
for
example
when
attending
online
classes
students
do
n t
have
to
worry
about
their
clothing
and
appearance
this
means
they
can
work
in
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
dressed
however
they
d
like
along
the
same
lines
students
are
not
subject
to
the
social
pressure
of
their
peers
when
attending
online
courses
on
the
other
hand
while
online
schooling
can
be
more
convenient
the
workload
stress
can
be
detrimental
to
student
success
with
traditional
school
there
is
an
instructor
present
to
keep
students
on
task
providing
an
overview
of
class
work
expectations
with
online
schooling
this
structure
is
not
always
present
meaning
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
stay
focused
when
they
do
n t
have
the
same
level
of
guidance
finally
one
of
the
key
drawbacks
to
online
school
is
the
lack
of
extracurricular
activities
while
traditional
school
allows
for
students
to
participate
in
events
such
as
plays
and
team
sports
these
activities
are
often
more
sparsely
available
in
the
online
realm
this
is
of
course
due
to
the
virtual
nature
of
the
school
setting
without
peers
and
tangible
events
to
participate
in
students
run
the
risk
of
feeling
a
lack
of
community
and
companionship
when
evaluating
whether
it
is
better
for
school
students
to
work
from
home
or
in
school
it
is
important
to
consider
factors
such
as
ease
of
access
to
resources
the
amount
of
work
that
gets
done
and
types
of
learning
working
from
home
may
be
easier
in
terms
of
accessibility
to
resources
as
students
can
easily
access
the
internet
to
find
the
information
they
need
furthermore
it
tends
to
be
easier
to
focus
and
work
more
diligently
while
at
home
as
there
are
fewer
distractions
on
the
other
hand
school
provides
more
structure
and
face to face
guidance
which
can
be
beneficial
for
certain
types
of
learning
such
as
verbal
debates
and
group
interactions
ultimately
the
decision
of
whether
to
work
from
home
or
in
school
depends
on
the
context
and
individual
needs
of
the
student
one
strategy
business
are
increasingly
adopting
to
conserve
energy
and
resources
is
to
decrease
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
office
each
week
by
implementing
a
four day
work
week
organizations
are
able
to
dramatically
reduce
their
energy
and
resource
consumption
both
directly
and
indirectly
for
example
fewer
hours
working
each
week
means
less
electricity
used
less
fuel
consumed
for
commuting
and
fewer
resources
wasted
on
stationery
and
utilities
despite
the
potential
advantages
of
a
four day
working
week
some
organizations
may
be
cautious
about
the
trade off
between
time
and
energy
savings
similarly
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
could
have
a
number
of
consequences
such
a
move
prevents
students
from
having
free time
after
school
and
could
lead
to
an
over scheduling
of
classes
and
activities
it
can
also
put
a
strain
on
resources
such
as
electricity
water
and
paper
reducing
the
school
s
ability
to
conserve
energy
and
resources
when
it
comes
to
education
there
is
a
clear
difference
between
the
energy
and
resources
used
when
attending
school
five
days
per
week
for
eight
hours
and
four
days
per
week
for
the
same
amount
of
time
while
the
total
amount
of
time
spent
remains
the
same
most
energy consuming
activities
such
as
heating
and
air conditioning
are
required
over
a
longer
period
when
school
is
spread
out
over
five
days
additionally
students
must
use
more
resources
such
as
fuel
to
commute
back
and
forth
to
school
five
days
per
week
as
opposed
to
four
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
comes
with
both
benefits
and
challenges
on
the
plus
side
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
give
someone
a
head
start
on
the
competition
by
providing
more
time
for
them
to
gain
experience
in
their
chosen
field
on
the
other
hand
there
is
potential
for
added
stress
for
young
people
who
must
adjust
to
the
responsibilities
associated
with
a
chosen
career
earlier
than
their
peers
it
is
important
for
young
people
considering
a
career
choice
to
examine
the
pros
and
cons
carefully
before
making
a
final
decision
studies
have
shown
that
younger
and
older
students
can
benefit
from
working
together
in
terms
of
academics
and
understanding
help
younger
students
have
the
potential
to
be
eager
and
motivated
to
learn
while
the
insight
of
older
students
can
be
helpful
in
teaching
and
guiding
them
to
excel
in
their
studies
through
collaboration
and
collaborative
learning
students
can
discuss
ideas
reflect
on
tasks
and
use
their
respective
strengths
to
help
each
other
furthermore
both
parties
can
bridge
the
generation
gap
allowing
them
to
understand
each
other
better
build
relationships
and
cultivate
a
deeper
understanding

i
ve
decided
to
pursue
a
career
as
a
web
developer
in
order
to
reach
the
goals
necessary
to
achieve
this
role
i
want
to
first
earn
a
web
development
diploma
or
a
related
degree
before
embarking
on
this
path
i
want
to
research
the
job
role
of
a
web
developer
to
make
sure
i
m
aware
of
all
the
duties
and
expectations
once
i
feel
comfortable
with
the
understanding
i
can
take
the
necessary
steps
to
achieve
the
diploma
or
degree
and
confidently
prepare
for
entering
into
the
world
of
web
development
policies
should
be
designed
to
encourage
students
to
maximize
their
potential
and
strive
for
success
requiring
a
average
for
students
to
participate
in
sports
and
activities
is
not
only
counterintuitive
to
this
goal
but
it
can
also
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
student
morale
and
motivation
forcing
students
to
maintain
a
average
in
order
to
participate
in
extra curricular
activities
does
not
necessarily
ensure
academic
success
it
can
actually
help
create
an
atmosphere
of
exclusion
wherein
students
do
not
feel
like
they
have
the
same
opportunities
or
privileges
as
those
around
them
this
can
lead
to
frustration
and
feelings
of
inadequacy
as
students
start
to
believe
that
they
must
achieve
a
certain
grade
average
to
deserve
recognition
and
reward
additionally
a
average
requirement
serves
as
a
disincentive
for
many
students
not
only
does
it
discourage
participation
it
can
also
discourage
students
from
attempting
to
join
in
the
first
place
instead
of
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
grow
and
learn
it
simply
sets
an
arbitrary
benchmark
that
some
may
struggle
to
reach
rather
than
having
a
b
average
policy
schools
should
focus
on
creating
an
environment
where
students
are
motivated
to
learn
grow
and
develop
their
hobbies
and
interests
activities
should
be
inclusive
and
easily
accessible
education
should
be
seen
as
the
ultimate
goal
and
students
need
to
be
given
the
freedom
to
follow
their
passions
and
explore
different
options
a
no grades
policy
is
the
best
way
to
ensure
this
happens
believed
that
the
key
to
getting
tasks
done
was
to
strike
a
balance
between
constant
work
and
rest
taking
time
to
rest
was
vital
in
order
to
refresh
memories
perfect
ideas
and
help
alleviate
the
temptation
of
overthinking
small
matters
by
ensuring
that
one
is
taking
the
time
to
rest
it
is
easier
to
tackle
tasks
with
the
appropriate
frame
of
mind
and
boost
efficiency
as
once
said
never
take
more
time
and
pains
than
is
necessary
for
a
thing
the
genuine
wisdom
is
in
taking
the
shortest
way
it
is
important
to
find
a
balance
between
staying
busy
and
taking
time
to
rest
to
avoid
feeling
overwhelmed
and
overstressed
is
essential
to
enable
focused
intentional
work
traditional
four
year
high
school
programs
have
many
valuable
benefits
compared
to
three
year
high
school
programs
to
begin
four
year
high
school
programs
give
students
more
time
to
explore
a
variety
of
different
subjects
and
develop
their
academic
interests
students
are
able
to
explore
content
outside
of
their
required
courses
like
music
theatre
and
a
variety
of
other
electives
allowing
them
to
expand
their
knowledge
and
foster
meaningful
relationships
with
their
peers
and
teachers
furthermore
four
year
programs
can
provide
students
with
more
realistic
expectations
about
the
difficulty
and
expectations
of
college
courses
which
can
help
them
better
prepare
for
the
demands
of
higher
education
by
comparison
three
year
programs
often
focus
on
a
more
limited
set
of
topics
and
can
impose
more
pressure
on
students
to
excel
in
a
narrow
range
of
study
while
advancing
through
the
educational
pipeline
quicker
can
save
time
and
money
it
may
also
leave
students
less
prepared
for
college
coursework
additionally
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
can
also
be
difficult
in
three
year
programs
as
students
have
less
time
to
explore
their
interests
in
conclusion
traditional
four
year
high
school
programs
offer
more
opportunities
for
students
to
broaden
their
knowledge
base
and
better
understand
the
college
experience
ahead
of
them
though
three
year
programs
may
offer
economic
advantages
their
outcomes
may
be
ill suited
to

success
technology
has
improved
the
quality
of

for
billions
of
people
around
the

it
has
helped
us
stay

even
when
we
re
miles
apart
allowed
us
to
make
quick
transactions
and
provided
us
with
access
to
almost
limitless

technology
has
also
allowed

in
addition
technology
has
revolutionized

it

easier
in
countless
ways
and
has
helped
us
to

to
efficiently
and
effectively

problems
that

we

after
school
activities
offer
advantages
such
as
providing
an
engaging
environment
with
a
sense
of
camaraderie
fostering
the
development
of
important
social
skills
and
enhancing
physical
health
additionally
students
in
after
school
activities
often
benefit
from
close
relationships
with
mentors
and
coaches
and
have
the
potential
to
be
part
of
a
team
however
after
school
activities
can
also
have
disadvantages
for
instance
students
may
be
exposed
to
activities
that
are
not
consistent
with
school
values
and
beliefs
and
the
amount
of
time
devoted
to
such
activities
may
interfere
with
the
student
s
ability
to
complete
their
homework
in
a
timely
manner
doing
homework
at
home
has
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
positive
side
a
student
is
able
to
work
independently
and
in
a
familiar
environment
where
they
may
feel
more
comfortable
and
secure
on
the
other
hand
it
can
be
hard
to
remain
focused
and
stay
on
task
without
the
structure
and
support
of
an
after
school
program
additionally
the
lack
of
peer
interactions
and
motivation
in
an
unstructured
setting
can
lead
to
a
student
becoming
easily
distracted
the
three year
high
school
program
is
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
four year
cycle
that
can
help
students
graduating
early
save
tuition
costs
or
enter
college
earlier
while
the
program
offers
some
advantages
there
are
also
several
potential
drawbacks
that
must
be
considered
on
the
positive
side
students
can
graduate
high
school
one
year
sooner
than
if
they
had
followed
the
tradition
four year
program
this
can
make
college
easier
to
manage
by
eliminating
extra
financial
expenses
and
allowing
students
more
time
to
focus
on
their
studies
additionally
students
who
are
looking
to
pursue
specialized
education
pathways
or
training
can
benefit
from
the
three year
program
by
entering
college
sooner
and
gaining
that
extra
year
of
experience
before
entering
the
workforce
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
biggest
downsides
to
the
three year
program
is
the
potential
limited
exposure
to
different
classes
and
other
learning
opportunities
high
school
students
might
not
have
the
time
to
develop
the
critical
thinking
and
problem solving
skills
needed
in
the
college
environment
if
they
don
t
have
access
to
a
full
range
of
classes
also
the
loss
of
the
extra
year
of
high
school
could
make
it
harder
to
transition
socially
and
might
add
an
extra
level
of
stress
as
students
try
to
adapt
to
college
life
the
three year
high
school
program
has
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
students
while
it
can
help
students
get
to
college
sooner
and
reduce
the
cost
of
tuition
the
limited
exposure
to
different
classes
and
social
aspects
should
be
taken
into
account
before
making
a
decision
in
modern
society
it
has
become
a
common
mindset
that
one
should
continually
grow
and
strive
for
more
than
what
they
currently
have
this
mentality
is
often
indicative
of
strong
ambition
and
personal
drive
as
wanting
to
move
forward
and
pursue
more
is
seen
as
a
positive
attribute
while
some
may
argue
that
it
is
possible
to
maintain
a
status
quo
and
have
a
fulfilling
life
it
is
essential
to
continue
growing
and
pushing
the
boundaries
of
our
capabilities
in
a
variety
of
ways
continuing
to
grow
and
strive
for
more
beyond
what
you
have
achieved
can
lead
to
positive
outcomes
such
as
increased
confidence
in
oneself
and
the
ability
to
tackle
increasingly
difficult
tasks
utilizing
existing
successes
as
motivation
and
fuel
for
success
can
propel
one
closer
to
their
goals
additionally
growth
can
come
in
the
form
of
experiences
or
knowledge
as
gaining
new
perspectives
and
skills
could
lead
to
a
more
successful
future
on
the
other
hand
stagnation
and
resistance
to
growth
can
be
limiting
in
the
absence
of
ambition
or
goals
individuals
may
lack
the
direction
necessary
to
lead
a
productive
life
allowing
oneself
to
become
too
comfortable
with
their
current
accomplishments
and
refusing
to
pursue
more
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
purpose
or
joy
in
their
life
without
continual
growth
it
can
become
easy
to
become
complacent
with
one
s
achievements
and
fail
to
recognize
potential
to
strive
for
greater
heights
overall
continuing
to
grow
and
strive
beyond
what
one
has
achieved
is
an
important
component
for
a
successful
life
by
embracing
growth
and
utilizing
existing
successes
as
motivation
one
can
push
boundaries
and
challenge
themselves
however
can
lead
to
feelings
of
complacency
and
lack
of
meaningful
direction
it
is
thus
essential
for
individuals
to
continue
growing
and
striving
to
achieve
greater
heights
as
humans
we
are
always
looking
to
grow
and
evolve
into
something
better
we
often
find
ourselves
looking
to
do
something
beyond
what
we
have
already
mastered
or
to
learn
a
different
skill
this
desire
to
take
on
something
new
can
be
a
valuable
tool
to
help
us
grow
and
develop
one
example
of
this
is
in
the
world
of
athletics
athletes
are
constantly
looking
to
take
their
existing
skills
to
the
next
level
by
adding
a
new
one
they
may
choose
to
work
on
improving
their
speed
or
agility
or
even
to
try
a
different
sport
altogether
this
process
helps
them
become
well rounded
athletes
and
ultimately
to
better
themselves
in
the
same
way
people
often
look
to
improve
their
existing
skills
in
order
to
find
success
in
a
job
or
career
for
example
someone
starting
out
in
an
entry level
job
may
take
a
course
or
even
just
read
a
book
to
learn
something
new
that
will
help
them
get
ahead
the
same
can
be
said
of
those
looking
to
change
careers
or
become
an
entrepreneur
ultimately
attempting
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
not
only
helps
you
to
grow
but
is
also
important
to
reaching
your
goals
and
achieving
success
by
exposing
yourself
to
something
entirely
new
you
open
yourself
up
to
new
opportunities
and
possibilities
that
would
n t
otherwise
be
available
taking
on
something
that
you
may
not
have
done
before
also
helps
you
to
gain
confidence
in
your
abilities
build
trust
in
yourself
and
even
to
become
a
better
problem
solver
all
of
these
skills
are
important
for
leading
a
successful
life
in
conclusion
attempting
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
can
help
you
grow
in
ways
that
you
may
have
never
expected
it
provides
you
with
the
opportunity
to
challenge
yourself
gain
new
skills
and
experiences
and
find
success
in
whatever
you
pursue
having
a
good
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
important
factors
for
leading
a
happy
and
successful
life
it
can
make
or
break
a
person
s
experience
in
the
highly
competitive
environments
of
school
or
work
studies
show
that
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
to
maximize
a
person
s
potential
and
increases
performance
for
example
many
athletes
cite
their
positive
attitude
as
one
of
the
contributing
factors
to
their
success
a
good
attitude
can
also
lead
to
greater
success
in
relationships
as
demonstrated
by
research
that
has
found
correlation
between
having
a
positive
outlook
and
experiencing
satisfying
relationships
on
the
other
hand
although
having
a
good
attitude
most
of
the
time
can
bring
many
benefits
it
can
be
detrimental
in
certain
situations
for
instance
when
faced
with
challenging
tasks
having
a
too
positive
outlook
can
lead
to
an
unrealistic
estimation
of
one
s
ability
to
accomplish
the
task
this
can
cause
disappointment
and
diminish
motivation
it
is
of
utmost
importance
for
parents
to
teach
children
how
to
cultivate
an
optimistic
attitude
and
instill
in
them
the
understanding
of
why
attitude
matters
studies
have
shown
that
developing
a
positive
outlook
from
a
young
age
increases
chances
of
having
successful
outcomes
in
adult
years
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
phrase
highlights
the
importance
of
perseverance
in
the
pursuit
of
success
emphasizing
that
even
if
you
face
failure
it
is
important
to
keep
going
in
order
to
eventually
achieve
success
failure
can
lead
to
success
in
a
variety
of
ways
for
example
famously
failed
more
than
times
while
testing
different
lightbulb
designs
but
eventually
made
an
important
breakthrough
that
enabled
electricity
to
be
used
in
homes
conversely
failure
can
create
problems
that
can
quickly
snowball
out
of
control
for
example
a
construction
project
that
is
done
on
a
deadline
may
not
leave
enough
time
for
mistakes
to
be
corrected
leading
to
costly
and
time consuming
delays
when
facing
failure
the
best
approach
is
to
face
it
head on
take
the
time
to
reflect
on
the
mistake
and
learn
from
it
then
identify
ways
to
improve
the
process
for
future
endeavors
additionally
it
is
important
to
seek
input
from
others
who
can
help
to
identify
potential
solutions
ultimately
failure
is
an
inescapable
part
of
the
success
process
recognizing
and
learning
from
failure
is
crucial
to
achieving
success
in
the
long
run
service
can
bring
about
substantial
positive
changes
to
our
school
community
and
beyond
allowing
students
to
complete
mandatory
service
hours
could
help
form
an
active
compassionate
and
responsible
student
body
that
goes
out
into
the
world
prepared
to
create
positive
change
we
should
start
teaching
students
to
give
back
to
their
community
right
away
when
everybody
pitches
in
a
little
the
benefits
are
felt
by
many
for
instance
community
service
encourages
youth
to
become
better
informed
citizens
as
they
start
to
think
more
about
the
wider
implications
of
their
actions
for
their
community
and
the
world
beyond
community
service
our
students
would
learn
to
prioritize
collaboration
and
collective
problem solving
as
well
as
acquire
habits
that
promote
positive
social
values
along
with
developing
an
understanding
of
societal
issues
volunteerism
helps
to
build
self confidence
and
practical
skills
our
students
would
be
developing
self esteem
as
they
gain
skills
that
would
be
beneficial
for
their
future
it
is
important
to
impart
a
sense
of
purpose
and
meaning
to
our
students
and
offering
opportunities
to
help
others
through
service
would
be
an
excellent
way
to
do
that
by
having
students
take
part
in
community
service
our
school
could
contribute
to
the
bettering
of
our
society
we
can
make
sure
that
students
gain
first hand
experience
that
will
help
to
build
responsible
citizens
who
are
ready
to
make
positive
changes
in
our
community
therefore
i
urge
the
principle
to
accept
the
idea
of
all
students
performing
community
service
as
i
begin
to
consider
my
future
i
find
myself
researching
potential
career
options
during
high
school
to
help
me
decide
which
career
i
would
like
to
pursue
upon
researching
potential
careers
i
assess
the
differences
between
them
in
terms
of
job
requirements
job
responsibilities
and
job
prospects
for
example
one
career
may
require
more
specialized
skills
or
significant
training
while
another
career
may
offer
more
flexibility
and
potential
for
growth
additionally
i
analyze
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
potential
career
carefully
weighing
my
options
i
settle
on
the
one
that
best
suits
my
interests
skills
and
abilities
after
careful
evaluation
i
have
concluded
that
the
career
which
best
suits
my
interests
skills
and
abilities
is
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
quote
suggests
that
although
failure
can
lead
to
a
sense
of
disappointment
it
does
not
have
to
be
the
end
of
the
story
failure
can
actually
be
a
stepping
stone
to
eventual
success
one
example
of
someone
who
successfully
used
failure
to
propel
them
to
success
is
he
famously
failed
times
when
trying
to
invent
the
light
bulb
yet
persevered
and
eventually
succeeded
this
is
an
insightful
example
of
how
failure
can
be
used
as
a
learning
experience
and
can
ultimately
lead
to
success
similarly
many
entrepreneurs
have
experienced
a
number
of
failures
before
finally
realizing
success
they
use
each
failure
to
evaluate
their
strategies
and
how
they
can
improve
their
approach
to
build
a
better
business
as
difficult
as
it
can
be
failure
for
an
entrepreneur
can
be
a
stepping
stone
to
success
and
viewing
it
as
such
is
essential
for
success
ultimately
failure
can
indeed
lead
to
success
as
demonstrated
by
s
quote
and
by
a
range
of
successful
individuals
and
entrepreneurs
rather
than
being
fearful
of
failure
it
is
important
to
embrace
it
and
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
by
understanding
the
power
of
failure
it
is
possible
to
use
it
to
achieve
ultimate
success
when
considering
the
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
it
is
clear
that
teamwork
has
certain
advantages
for
starters
when
trying
to
tackle
a
complex
problem
or
project
there
is
often
more
brain
power
within
a
group
than
an
individual
working
in
a
group
enables
different
individuals
to
come
together
and
share
their
unique
insights
and
perspectives
helping
complete
the
task
quickly
and
efficiently
working
in
a
group
also
allows
people
to
divide
the
workload
so
each
individual
is
responsible
for
a
certain
component
or
task
this
can
help
ensure
that
no
one
person
is
overwhelmed
with
too
much
work
and
hold
the
team
accountable
for
completing
their
tasks
in
a
timely
manner
working
with
others
provides
an
opportunity
for
people
to
learn
from
each
other
discussions
and
brainstorming
can
help
bring
new
and
innovative
ideas
to
the
table
and
help
everyone
learn
from
each
other
while
working
alone
is
beneficial
in
some
cases
it
is
often
more
beneficial
to
have
a
group
of
people
who
are
dedicated
and
motivated
to
work
together
towards
a
common
goal
working
in
a
group
also
leads
to
a
sense
of
community
and
collaboration
which
can
help
build
rapport
between
members
this
helps
create
a
supportive
and
encouraging
environment
which
can
inspire
individuals
to
continue
working
hard
and
reach
their
goals
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
there
are
many
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
from
increased
productivity
and
effort
to
learning
from
each
other
and
creating
a
sense
of
community
working
in
a
group
can
help
people
to
make
progress
on
challenging
projects
learn
new
skills
and
work
together
towards
a
common
goal
first
impressions
can
have
a
lasting
impact
on
one
s
life
it
s
no
wonder
people
are
often
concerned
with
the
impression
they
make
upon
first
meeting
someone
although
a
first
impression
can
be
challenging
to
change
it
is
possible
to
alter
perspectives
over
time
unfortunately
the
task
of
changing
one
s
first
impression
can
be
a
difficult
and
arduous
one
and
requires
persistence
and
effort
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
the
effects
the
impression
can
have
on
relationships
and
future
success
a
favorable
first
impression
could
be
the
difference
between
feeling
accepted
or
rejected
and
might
even
be
a
defining
factor
in
maintaining
meaningful
connections
furthermore
it
can
affect
people
s
ability
to
find
success
in
their
future
endeavors
for
all
these
reasons
first
impressions
can
be
incredibly
important
and
should
be
observed
carefully
it
s
important
to
be
yourself
even
if
it
means
that
fewer
people
might
like
or
understand
you
being
someone
you
are
not
even
to
fit
in
can
come
at
a
cost
many
people
pretend
to
be
someone
else
out
of
fear
of
judgment
but
this
can
harm
the
person
pretending
as
well
as
the
person
they
are
pretending
to
be
posing
as
someone
else
can
make
it
more
difficult
to
trust
yourself
and
make
decisions
as
well
as
stunt
your
personal
growth
not
only
that
but
it
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
society
if
we
are
all
pretending
to
be
people
we
are
not
people
need
to
see
each
other
for
who
they
really
are
only
then
will
society
be
able
to
come
together
even
if
it
contains
diverse
groups
of
people
when
everyone
is
able
to
express
who
they
really
are
then
relationships
become
more
authentic
and
honest
being
yourself
is
important
and
the
impact
it
could
have
on
society
as
a
whole
should
not
be
understated
learning
or
the
utilization
of
technology based
tools
as
an
alternative
to
traditional
in person
instruction
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
option
in
the
educational
context
learning
has
the
potential
to
provide
students
with
increased
flexibility
and
autonomy
over
their
learning
such
as
the
ability
to
work
at
their
own
pace
or
attend
to
other
commitments
while
still
accessing
course
material
in
addition
distance
learning
makes
courses
offered
by
different
institutions
available
to
anyone
with
access
to
the
internet
opening
up
more
learning
possibilities
at
the
same
time
distance
learning
can
be
detrimental
to
some
students
certain
students
such
as
those
who
do
not
have
consistent
access
to
the
internet
or
reliable
technology
may
face
difficulty
in
completing
their
course
material
in
a
timely
and
efficient
manner
direct
instructions
and
guidance
from
teachers
can
be
severely
limited
in
a
distance
learning
environment
which
can
be
problematic
for
those
who
require
more
support
in
their
learning
overall
the
pros
and
cons
of
distance
learning
must
be
weighed
carefully
depending
on
each
individual
student
s
learning
requirements
and
situation
learning
can
be
an
effective
and
beneficial
form
of
learning
in
some
contexts
but
it
can
also
be
limiting
and
counterproductive
in
others
the
digital
age
has
changed
the
landscape
of
interpersonal
relationships
and
provided
us
with
a
multitude
of
tools
to
communicate
in
a
wide
variety
of
ways
while
these
tools
have
enabled
us
to
connect
with
friends
and
family
from
around
the
world
technology
has
also
had
some
negative
effects
on
relationships
as
well
a
major
issue
lies
in
the
amount
of
time
that
is
devoted
to
and
is
lost
with
social
media
spending
too
much
time
on
social
networks
such
as
and
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
relationships
it
can
create
a
disconnect
between
people
by
replacing
face to face
contact
with
virtual
interaction
individuals
may
find
themselves
more
comfortable
confiding
in
social
media
apps
rather
than
discussing
their
problems
with
their
friends
in
person
finally
the
reliance
on
technology
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
basic
social
skills
such
as
active
listening
and
reading
body
language
skills
that
form
a
vital
part
of
forming
and
maintaining
relationships
the
overreliance
on
technology
in
the
digital
age
is
having
a
negative
effect
on
interpersonal
relationships
and
it
is
important
to
establish
a
balance
for
our
own
well being
and
the
well being
of
those
around
us
organizing
a
community
service
project
to
help
improve
the
environment
in
my
local
area
requires
breaking
the
project
into
smaller
manageable
steps
i
must
identify
a
specific
goal
for
the
project
some
possible
goals
could
be
to
reduce
air
and
water
pollution
plant
more
trees
clean
up
parks
and
public
areas
and
so
on
once
i
have
identified
the
goal
for
the
project
i
must
specify
how
this
goal
can
be
achieved
for
example
if
my
goal
is
to
plant
more
trees
i
must
determine
the
type
of
tree
and
how
many
trees
will
be
planted
and
the
location
for
the
planting
next
i
need
to
determine
any
additional
resources
needed
for
the
project
such
as
plants
soil
tools
funds
volunteers
and
so
on
i
must
also
create
an
outreach
plan
for
getting
the
help
needed
in
order
to
successfully
complete
the
project
this
could
involve
reaching
out
to
local
businesses
or
organizations
for
donations
or
support
recruiting
volunteers
and
leveraging
social
media
finally
i
need
to
set
up
a
timeline
that
will
ensure
the
project
is
completed
on
time
considering
one
s
first
impression
when
making
decisions
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
one
hand
we
may
be
able
to
gain
a
quicker
and
informed
understanding
of
a
person
or
situation
on
the
other
our
assumptions
may
be
limited
or
misguided
preventing
us
from
making
truly
objective
decisions
alternatively
when
we
wait
to
form
a
more
complete
opinion
there
is
the
danger
of
procrastinating
and
making
decisions
too
late
still
this
tactic
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
make
informed
decisions
that
take
into
account
all
information
gathered
over
time
ultimately
one
s
approach
will
depend
on
the
situation
at
hand
and
the
desired
outcome
though
years
have
passed
since
wrote
in
his
autobiography
that
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
his
words
of
wisdom
still
have
relevance
in
modern
life
we
still
face
the
temptation
to
idleness
checking
social
media
continually
wasting
time
and
energy
on
inconsequential
tasks
trying
to
avoid
doing
work
and
opting
out
of
difficult
conversations
in
the
same
way
that
we
can
manage
our
physical
health
by
getting
enough
sleep
eating
right
and
exercising
we
can
maintain
our
mental
health
by
managing
our
time
and
avoiding
idleness
in
my
own
experiences
i
have
found
that
when
i
avoid
idleness
and
have
a
plan
for
how
i
will
use
my
time
i
am
able
to
remain
productive
and
focused
throughout
the
day
over
time
i
have
also
learned
that
not
responding
to
provocation
is
a
surefire
way
to
avoid
idleness
when
i
am
tempted
to
dodge
work
feuds
with
coworkers
or
lambast
people
on
social
media
i
can
regain
my
composure
by
not
reacting
when
i
remain
positive
in
the
face
of
difficult
situations
i
can
maintain
my
mental
health
and
avoid
wasting
my
time
technology
lifestyle
and
culture
have
obviously
changed
since
s
words
still
ring
true
we
can
all
avoid
idleness
by
managing
our
time
and
not
responding
to
provocation
doing
so
will
not
only
benefit
our
mental
health
but
could
also
help
to
achieve
amazing
things
working
in
groups
on
school
projects
can
have
many
benefits
it
allows
students
to
practice
teamwork
which
is
an
important
skill
to
have
in
today
s
job
market
the
presence
of
others
can
also
help
motivate
students
to
complete
their
work
and
by
splitting
up
tasks
in
a
group
the
workload
is
more
manageable
and
can
help
each
group
member
achieve
better
results
additionally
working
in
groups
allows
students
to
share
ideas
which
can
lead
to
better
results
than
they
would
get
working
alone
this
kind
of
collaboration
helps
to
develop
creativity
and
provides
a
more
effective
learning
environment
working
in
groups
on
school
projects
is
a
great
way
for
students
to
learn
how
to
work
together
productively
and
achieve
the
desired
outcome
in
the
modern
world
where
people
are
increasingly
pressed
for
time
and
working
long
hours
the
idea
of
a
four day
work
week
with
each
day
consisting
of
ten
hours
at
school
has
become
the
subject
of
much
debate
on
the
one
hand
having
four
days
at
school
could
have
many
advantages
firstly
by
packing
the
same
amount
of
material
into
four
days
instead
of
five
students
would
have
more
time
to
dedicate
to
other
areas
this
could
be
used
to
get
more
sleep
take
part
in
extra curricular
activities
or
to
spend
time
with
family
and
friends
secondly
it
would
allow
students
to
reduce
the
amount
of
time
they
spend
commuting
which
could
have
a
positive
effect
on
their
stress
levels
on
the
other
hand
having
four
days
instead
of
five
would
present
some
cons
as
well
it
would
mean
that
students
would
have
a
greater
amount
of
material
to
cover
in
every
class
compared
to
a
five day
week
by
percent
in
total
this
could
lead
to
burnout
as
well
as
reduce
the
amount
of
time
that
students
have
to
fully
comprehend
the
material
additionally
it
could
lead
to
a
greater
focus
on
memorizing
material
over
actually
understanding
it
further
reducing
students
knowledge
overall
increasing
the
length
of
school
days
from
five
to
four
with
each
day
being
ten
hours
long
is
an
idea
that
could
bring
advantages
to
students
such
as
having
more
free
time
and
reducing
their
stress
levels
but
also
has
some
downsides
such
as
leading
to
burnout
and
reducing
students
knowledge
it
is
important
to
carefully
weigh
both
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
any
decisions
regarding
this
issue
when
considering
whether
to
ask
one
person
or
multiple
people
for
advice
there
are
several
pros
and
cons
to
consider
asking
one
person
means
that
individual
is
likely
more
familiar
with
the
situation
and
may
be
better
able
to
provide
specific
detailed
advice
quoting
when
i
need
to
make
a
tough
decision
i
usually
ask
one
wise
person
i
trust
on
the
other
hand
asking
multiple
people
for
advice
can
provide
a
variety
of
perspectives
and
insights
as
the
saying
goes
two
heads
are
better
than
one
anecdotes
can
also
be
useful
for
example
one
person
might
have
asked
advice
from
three
friends
and
found
that
taking
a
combination
of
all
their
advice
was
more
effective
than
following
any
one
of
them
exclusively
overall
i
believe
that
asking
one
person
for
advice
is
the
most
beneficial
it
allows
for
a
more
personal
and
detailed
understanding
of
the
situation
and
potential
best
course
of
action
additionally
the
expertise
of
one
trusted
individual
can
often
be
more
reliable
than
the
general
consensus
of
multiple
people
our
enthusiasm
is
one
of
the
most
important
catalysts
in
achieving
success
after
all
if
you
lack
passion
in
pursuing
your
goals
it
will
become
increasingly
difficult
to
stay
motivated
along
the
journey
in
addition
to
enthusiasm
the
willingness
to
accept
failure
plays
an
equally
important
role
in
succeeding
overcoming
failure
strengthens
our
resilience
and
provides
opportunities
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
improve
this
can
be
seen
in
the
history
of
many
of
our
most
successful
innovators
for
example
famously
failed
times
in
his
attempt
to
invent
the
lightbulb
but
he
persevered
and
eventually
succeeded
this
anecdote
illustrates
how
failure
can
sometimes
be
a
necessary
step
to
reach
success
therefore
we
must
embrace
failure
wholeheartedly
and
not
be
scared
of
the
roadblocks
that
are
put
in
our
way
we
must
actively
seek
out
opportunities
try
new
things
and
create
a
culture
of
innovation
and
risk taking
learning
to
accept
failure
can
help
us
grow
and
provide
us
with
valuable
lessons
to
learn
from
with
enthusiasm
in
our
hearts
and
an
open
mind
to
failure
we
will
have
the
resources
to
succeed
self reliance
and
making
independent
decisions
are
essential
keys
to
personal
growth
individuals
should
strive
to
become
self sufficient
and
learn
to
make
decisions
on
their
own
for
example
when
making
a
major
life
decision
such
as
buying
a
house
getting
married
or
dropping
out
of
school
individuals
should
rely
on
themselves
rather
than
asking
for
help
or
advice
from
someone
else
as
it
allows
for
greater
personal
growth
and
self efficacy
asking
for
someone
else
s
opinion
when
making
a
decision
can
sometimes
be
detrimental
since
it
allows
for
external
influence
thus
limiting
an
individual
s
independence
and
autonomy
therefore
it
is
important
to
practice
self reliance
and
develop
the
capacity
to
make
independent
decisions
in
order
to
achieve
personal
growth
the
late
british
famously
declared
that
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
this
statement
holds
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
its
meaning
as
while
failure
is
unavoidable
those
who
maintain
enthusiasm
when
things
don
t
go
their
way
are
able
to
remain
positive
and
even
learn
from
their
mistakes
learning
from
failure
is
essential
for
success
as
an
individual
who
fails
and
then
strives
to
improve
from
their
experience
is
likely
to
reach
their
desired
outcome
perseverance
can
be
a
great
asset
in
this
respect
as
an
individual
who
does
not
surrender
to
failure
is
more
likely
to
find
success
in
the
end
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
necessary
to
fail
in
order
to
learn
and
find
success
with
careful
planning
research
and
determination
an
individual
can
find
success
without
the
added
disappointment
of
failure
it
is
furthermore
possible
that
an
individual
may
gain
a
sense
of
confidence
which
kernels
from
a
long term
period
of
success
and
will
thus
be
less
likely
to
fail
or
struggle
in
future
endeavours
when
it
comes
to
advice
and
wisdom
listening
to
the
elders
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
take
the
example
of
and
have
plenty
of
life
experience
to
offer
may
have
insight
into
areas
such
as
career
choices
investments
and
other
matters
that
are
related
to
the
world
today
on
the
other
hand
may
be
able
to
offer
advice
and
wisdom
related
to
topics
like
family
dynamics
social
situations
and
moral
guidance
both
have
different
yet
equally
valuable
opinions
that
could
prove
to
be
beneficial
to
someone
who
is
seeking
advice
listening
to
the
wisdom
of
those
more
experienced
can
be
an
incredibly
useful
resource
for
anyone
looking
to
make
well informed
decisions
year round
education
and
the
traditional
school
approach
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
one
hand
year round
education
can
result
in
a
greater
retention
of
material
for
students
since
the
breaks
between
classes
are
shorter
and
students
are
able
to
stay
engaged
and
motivated
to
learn
for
longer
periods
of
time
at
the
same
time
students
must
also
put
in
more
effort
to
complete
the
same
amount
of
material
within
the
shorter
schedule
and
teachers
must
adjust
their
plans
more
often
the
school
board
must
also
take
into
account
the
effects
of
a
year round
schedule
in
terms
of
preparation
for
tests
it
may
be
difficult
for
students
to
remember
what
they
learned
after
an
extended
break
and
the
shortened
break
periods
of
a
year round
approach
may
require
more
frequent
testing
that
could
add
to
the
stress
levels
of
students
in
summary
while
year round
education
can
lead
to
increased
student
retention
and
engagement
the
increased
effort
and
frequency
of
testing
can
lead
to
more
stress
and
difficulty
for
students
and
the
school
board
careful
consideration
is
needed
to
determine
which
approach
best
suits
a
given
school
s
circumstances
the
question
of
implementing
a
four day
school
week
with
extended
hours
for
primary
and
secondary
schools
in
the
states
is
complex
proponents
of
the
scheme
point
out
that
it
could
save
schools
money
on
staff
and
transportation
as
well
as
reducing
absences
and
tardiness
additionally
the
extended
days
could
give
students
more
time
for
collaborative
projects
experiential
learning
and
individualized
instruction
on
the
other
hand
opponents
worry
that
the
extended
days
could
be
difficult
for
working
parents
to
manage
and
that
student
learning
could
suffer
if
teachers
are
unable
to
cover
the
same
amount
of
content
in
fewer
days
additionally
lower income
students
could
be
disproportionately
impacted
as
they
are
less
likely
to
have
access
to
childcare
and
other
academic
resources
outside
of
school
balancing
these
concerns
it
appears
that
a
four day
school
week
with
extended
hours
is
likely
to
be
beneficial
in
some
cases
such
as
rural
communities
or
schools
with
tight
budgets
however
extensive
research
should
be
done
to
ensure
the
implementation
of
such
a
scheme
does
not
negatively
impact
student
learning
or
access
to
education
for
all
students
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
importance
of
imagination
and
knowledge
in
equal
measure
he
said
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
for
knowledge
is
limited
whereas
imagination
embraces
the
entire
world
stimulating
progress
giving
birth
to
evolution
by
combining
imagination
and
knowledge
both
individuals
and
society
can
develop
solutions
and
build
positive
change
for
example
it
is
imagination
that
successfully
takes
a
concept
from
inception
to
reality
however
knowledge
is
essential
for
refining
ideas
to
turn
them
into
tangible
solutions
also
saw
the
power
of
a
child
s
imagination
first hand
noting
how
it
could
inspire
innovation
and
creativity
he
said
the
true
sign
of
intelligence
is
not
knowledge
but
imagination
however
if
this
imagination
is
not
nurtured
in
a
positive
way
it
could
have
the
opposite
effect
and
ultimately
stunt
the
development
of
a
child
s
creativity
fear
can
often
be
used
to
control
children
either
directly
or
indirectly
and
this
can
lead
to
the
repressing
of
their
imagination
therefore
it
is
essential
to
nurture
and
nourish
a
child
s
imagination
rather
than
frightening
them
with
the
college
admissions
process
becoming
increasingly
competitive
there
are
several
steps
one
should
take
to
ensure
they
have
the
best
chance
of
being
accepted
to
get
into
college
a
student
should
focus
on
their
academics
first
and
foremost
setting
a
study
schedule
that
allows
them
to
dedicate
time
to
their
classes
sports
practice
and
any
other
activities
additionally
they
should
take
advantage
of
any
tutoring
services
that
are
available
for
and
places
where
they
can
hone
their
skills
and
ask
for
advice
during
their
studies
students
should
be
wary
of
their
phone
and
other
distractions
it
can
be
hard
to
stay
focused
but
avoiding
the
phone
notifications
and
other
temptations
is
key
to
staying
on
top
of
one
s
studies
additionally
students
should
listen
to
and
abide
by
their
coaches
advice
in
order
to
improve
their
performance
in
whichever
sport
they
may
be
playing
finally
students
should
also
remember
to
reflect
on
and
document
the
story
of
their
mother
working
hard
to
ensure
they
have
the
best
opportunities
this
could
be
done
in
the
form
of
a
journal
entry
or
essay
as
a
way
to
cultivate
appreciation
for
all
the
effort
their
mother
puts
in
for
them
these
steps
can
remind
students
why
devoting
time
to
academics
and
extracurricular
activities
is
so
important
being
a
good
person
and
a
good
citizen
are
two
important
qualities
that
people
should
strive
for
in
life
by
researching
these
qualities
one
can
gain
insight
into
how
their
own
problems
can
affect
their
career
and
how
exhibiting
good
behaviors
can
help
them
in
life
it
is
also
important
to
be
a
good
student
in
order
to
gain
credit
for
college
as
well
as
to
be
responsible
and
work
hard
to
complete
goals
lastly
helping
other
people
can
make
a
huge
impact
and
demonstrates
good
behavior
it
can
be
as
simple
as
offering
a
lending
hand
to
a
neighbor
or
donating
to
a
local
cause
all
in
all
developing
and
exhibiting
qualities
of
a
good
person
and
citizen
are
essential
for
a
thriving
and
successful
life
when
considering
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
school
day
one
hour
and
thirty
minutes
longer
there
are
several
different
points
to
consider
on
the
one
hand
adding
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
would
give
students
more
time
to
cover
material
in
their
classes
which
could
benefit
their
grades
and
increase
their
opportunities
for
success
additionally
it
could
provide
more
time
for
students
to
complete
after school
activities
such
as
sports
and
arts
programs
as
well
as
give
students
extra
time
to
complete
their
homework
or
participate
in
extra
study
sessions
on
the
other
hand
a
longer
school
day
could
mean
an
overall
decrease
in
the
amount
of
free
time
students
have
to
themselves
this
could
lead
to
unnecessary
stress
as
students
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
work
they
have
to
complete
in
a
day
additionally
it
could
also
lead
to
exhaustion
as
students
can
become
worn
down
by
having
less
time
to
rest
and
recharge
in
conclusion
there
are
both
positive
and
negative
aspects
to
consider
when
contemplating
whether
or
not
to
change
the
length
of
the
school
day
ultimately
it
is
important
to
carefully
think
through
and
weigh
these
different
factors
in
order
to
make
an
informed
and
beneficial
decision
spending
time
outdoors
has
many
advantages
from
physical
exercise
to
mental
health
benefits
going
outdoors
can
have
a
wide
ranging
positive
impact
outdoor
activities
include
sports
walking
and
cycling
to
name
a
few
outdoor
games
such
as
football
and
the
offer
exciting
opportunities
for
groups
of
people
to
go
outside
and
enjoy
while
getting
healthy
exercise
without
a
balanced
amount
of
outdoor
time
people
can
be
prone
to
lack
of
motivation
and
even
depression
this
may
be
due
to
people
s
saturation
or
over dependence
on
indoor
activities
such
as
gaming
listening
to
music
outdoors
can
be
a
pleasant
and
rewarding
experience
however
it
is
important
to
take
safety
precautions
such
as
wearing
earplugs
and
avoiding
loud
noise
it
is
also
important
to
be
aware
of
the
weather
and
any
potential
dangers
like
slippery
surfaces
overall
there
are
numerous
reasons
to
go
outdoors
and
reap
the
rewards
of
the
experience
the
renowned
jazz
musician
once
asserted
a
problem
is
a
chance
for
you
to
do
your
best
this
inspiring
statement
encourages
us
to
look
at
challenges
as
opportunities
rather
than
burdens
from
a
sociopsychological
perspective
this
notion
is
particularly
persuasive
because
it
encourages
a
productive
growth
mindset
rather
than
a
fixed
prisoner to the problem
mentality
i
thoroughly
agree
with
s
statement
there
is
no
doubt
that
problems
are
difficult
and
daunting
but
s
quote
encourages
us
to
remember
that
a
successful
resolution
to
a
problem
requires
hard
work
perseverance
and
dedication
and
therefore
presents
an
opportunity
to
hone
our
skills
and
potentially
reap
satisfying
rewards
moreover
being
able
to
rise
to
the
occasion
and
find
innovative
solutions
to
challenging
issues
can
result
in
a
sense
of
pride
and
accomplishment
that
stays
with
us
long
after
the
task
is
completed
therefore
s
quote
is
a
profound
reminder
of
the
importance
of
approaching
challenges
as
unique
opportunities
and
the
fundamental
truth
that
if
we
are
willing
to
try
our
best
in
difficult
situations
great
things
can
be
achieved
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
a
critical
step
in
growing
up
as
it
allows
one
to
better
understand
and
accept
the
consequences
of
their
choices
factors
such
as
trust
in
others
judgment
of
others
avoiding
bad
influences
and
questioning
oneself
before
taking
action
can
all
play
a
role
in
the
decision making
process
when
taken
into
consideration
these
factors
can
help
to
provide
a
more
complete
picture
as
one
makes
their
decisions
the
effects
of
making
decisions
on
one
s
own
can
be
far reaching
leading
to
improved
self confidence
more
self reliance
and
a
sense
of
freedom
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
consequences
of
decisions
should
always
be
taken
into
account
not
doing
so
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
one
s
life
such
as
leading
to
financial
or
physical
stress
which
can
cause
even
more
difficulty
in
the
long
run
in
conclusion
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
an
important
part
of
life
and
can
be
beneficial
if
done
with
consideration
for
all
possible

that
could
lead
to
positive
life
changes
completing
high
school
in
three
instead
of
four
years
is
certainly
a
tempting
idea
as
it
shortens
the
amount
of
time
that
students
spend
in
school
if
they
wish
to
enter
college
or
the
professional
workforce
early
however
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
consider
including
stress
and
a
lack
of
elective
classes
on
the
positive
side
finishing
high
school
early
allows
students
to
save
time
and
energy
during
a
crucial
period
in
their
developmental
years
allowing
them
to
focus
more
directly
on
other
pursuits
in
addition
leaving
high
school
early
can
give
students
an
advantage
for
college
acceptance
scholarships
and
internships
furthermore
those
who
enter
the
workforce
at
an
earlier
age
may
have
more
opportunities
for
professional
development
and
career
advancement
as
they
have
a
longer
period
of
time
to
build
their
experiences
and
skills
however
finishing
high
school
early
can
also
lead
to
stress
students
who
are
in
a
hurry
to
finish
their
courses
may
not
give
themselves
time
to
fully
digest
the
material
which
can
put
them
at
a
disadvantage
when
moving
on
to
the
next
stage
in
addition
students
may
miss
out
on
certain
elective
classes
if
they
can
not
find
enough
time
in
their
course

many
students
rely
on
elective
courses
to
gain
knowledge
in
areas
they
are
passionate
about
so
this
can
be
a
problem
if
there
isn

sufficient
time
in
conclusion
it
is
an
individual
choice
whether
or
not
to
finish
high
school
early
while
there
are
some
potential
advantages
such
as
taking
advantage
of
college
or
career
opportunities
there
are
also
possible
drawbacks
such
as
increased
stress
and
lack
of
elective
courses
therefore
students
should
weigh
their
options
carefully
and
decide
what
is
best
for
them
in
famously
declared
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
statement
a
rallying
cry
for
determination
in
the
face
of
difficulty
has
been
held
as
an
essential
tenet
of
success
the
idea
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
has
strong
advantages
being
resilient
and
passionate
in
the
face
of
struggle
can
help
an
individual
persist
and
ultimately
achieve
success
conversely
going
from
failure
to
failure
with
a
loss
of
enthusiasm
can
be
extremely
detrimental
when
faced
with
failure
a
discouraged
attitude
can
lead
an
individual
to
become
apathetic
and
even
worse
to
give
up
altogether
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
distinction
between
both
approaches
to
success
and
opt
for
the
former
whenever
possible
throughout
history
many
figures
have
illustrated
the
power
of
s
words
for
example
inventor
famously
failed
thousands
of
times
before
discovering
the
first
working
incandescent
lightbulb
his
refusal
to
let
failure
stand
in
his
way
highlights
the
importance
of
sustaining
enthusiasm
and
resilience
in
the
pursuit
of
success
african
rights
leader
showed
similar
determination
when
she
took
a
stand
against
segregation
on
a
bus
in
in
the
face
of
failure
and
difficulty
it
is
paramount
to
draw
motivation
from
the
idea
of
perseverance
and
never
giving
up
s
words
embody
this
notion
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
despite
challenges
can
not
be
understated
it
has
the
potential
to
take
a
person
from
failure
to
success
break
is
an
essential
part
of
the
academic
calendar
for
many
students
and
can
offer
a
number
of
important
benefits
over
having
breaks
throughout
the
year
by
having
one
break
over
a
long
period
students
may
be
more
likely
to
retain
what
they
ve
learned
prior
to
their
break
without
detrimental
effects
from
repeated
long
breaks
throughout
the
year
additionally
having
an
extended
period
away
from
school
gives
students
a
much
needed
mental
health
break
and
time
to
reconnect
with
family
and
friends
furthermore
having
all
breaks
in
a
concentrated
period
allows
students
to
focus
on
other
activities
such
as
part time
jobs
or
internships
to
develop
life
skills
and
can
help
alleviate
any
pressures
that
may
arise
if
they
are
trying
to
manage
part time
work
throughout
the
year
alongside
school
finally
summer
break
can
be
used
to
revise
and
strengthen
understanding
of
difficult
topics
that
had
been
encountered
during
the
year
allowing
students
to
return
to
school
feeling
more
prepared
and
more
successful
in
their
studies
in
conclusion
having
summer
break
as
an
extended
break
throughout
the
year
is
much
more
beneficial
for
students
both
in
terms
of
academic
achievement
and
personal
well being
completing
a
full
four
years
of
high
school
before
moving
on
to
college
can
help
students
build
essential
skills
and
gain
knowledge
for
their
future
for
instance
skills
such
as
better
time
management
organization
writing
and
study
techniques
can
be
developed
over
the
four
year
period
this
can
help
students
apply
these
skills
to
their
college
courses
eventually
translating
into
better
grades
and
success
on
the
contrary
leaving
high
school
one
year
earlier
than
traditional
can
be
challenging
without
the
full
four year
curriculum
students
may
lack
the
exposure
to
higher
level
classes
needed
to
perform
well
in
college
additionally
early
graduation
can
sometimes
hinder
self development
as
students
may
miss
out
on
important
milestones
that
could
contribute
to
maturity
level
and
development
for
example
one
student
left
high
school
early
in
order
to
take
a
dual enrollment
course
at
a
local
college
by
not
experiencing
a
full
four
years
of
high
school
the
student
lacked
the
maturity
level
and
knowledge
needed
to
succeed
in
college
academics
as
a
result
her
grades
began
to
suffer
it
is
clear
that
while
leaving
high
school
early
can
be
appealing
to
some
it
is
important
to
consider
the
effects
it
may
have
on
a
student
s
future
taking
the
four
year
high
school
experience
can
help
them
prepare
for
the
rigors
of
college
by
developing
crucial
skills
and
knowledge
while
also
allowing
them
to
build
maturity
and
grow
into
adulthood
first

are
incredibly
important
as
they
can
shape
the
way
a
person
thinks
about
you
and
your
reputation
for
potentially
long
lasting
effects
making
a
strong
first
impression
is
the
key
to
fostering
subsequent
relationships
as
making
a
bad
impression
can
be
difficult
to
change
people
often
have
a
hard
time
altering
their
personal
opinion
of
someone
after
a
single
encounter
as
they
are
driven
by
emotions
and
memories
that
can
be
difficult
to
overcome
to
try
and
change
a
person
s
first
impression
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
situation
before
you
enter
and
to
take
cues
from
the
environment
active
listening
being
present
in
the
conversation
and
cultivating
genuine
interest
from
your
conversation
partner
are
all
great
ways
to
make
an
effort
in
shifting
the
impression
of
yourself
additionally
following
up
after
a
meeting
and
striving
to
improve
the
relationship
over
time
can
help
in
changing
someone
s
initial
impression
of
you
ultimately
it
is
clear
that
your
initial
impression
on
another
person
can
have
a
lasting
effect
this
is
why
it
is
so
important
to
give
off
the
right
impression

it
can
have
far

on
forming
relationships
establishing
your
reputation
and
helping
you

towards
achieving
your

high
school
is
a
difficult
time
for
many
students
as
they
are
faced
with
the
pressures
and
stresses
of
adolescence
and
academic
achievement
art
classes
can
be
a
great
way
for
students
to
relieve
stress
and
improve
their
ability
to
absorb
new
information
making
art
classes
mandatory
for
high
school
students
provides
many
benefits
such
as
giving
students
access
to
creative
outlets
developing
grit
and
mental
focus
and
improving
communication
skills
however
it
can
be
difficult
to
maintain
focus
in
art
classes
especially
when
compared
to
more
conventional
academic
classes
moreover
some
students
may
be
resistant
to
the
required
coursework
and
feel
that
it
takes
away
from
their
academic
pursuits
students
who
are
not
particularly
interested
in
art
classes
can
still
benefit
from
them
art
classes
can
often
provide
a
refreshing
break
from
the
regular
academic
curriculum
and
teaching
students
creative
problem
solving
can
help
to
improve
their
critical
thinking
skills
additionally
focusing
on
something
other
than
academic
subjects
for
a
period
of
time
can
be
a
great
way
for
students
to
re energize
themselves
and
gain
a
new
perspective
on
their
studies
the
use
of
technology
in
modern
times
has
had
a
significant
impact
on
people

in
conclusion
the
advantages
of

are
evident
in
the
way
it
helps
us
with
our
daily

technology
has
made
life
easier
and
more
enjoyable
and
its
impact
will
continue
to
be
felt
in
the
years
to

it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
its
possible
dangers
and
be
conscious
of
the
way
it
can
be
used
in
summary
technology
makes
many
activities
more
convenient
and
improves
the
quality
of
our
lives
offering
access
to
crucial

easier
shopping
options
and
a
world
of
gaming
opportunities
the
effects
of
technology
limiting
human
contact
have
been
widely
researched
and
debated
on
one
hand
technology
has
enabled
people
to
connect
from
literally
any
corner
of
the
world
in
an
instant
through
social
media
and
video conferencing
family
members
who
live
far
away
can
easily
stay
in
touch
filling
thousands
of
miles
of
physical
space
with
the
warmth
of
digital
connection
in
addition
with
the
rise
of
freelance
work
more
and
more
people
have
been
able
to
turn
their
passions
into
professions
without
ever
having
to
leave
their
homes
they
can
take
on
jobs
located
anywhere
and
communicate
seamlessly
to
reach
their
goals
on
the
other
hand
such
restriction
of
human
contact
while
convenient
can
also
have
its
drawbacks
the
loss
of
some
in person
connections
and
social
interactions
has
the
potential
to
increase
feelings
of
isolation
and
depression
in
addition
digital
contact
does
not
always
amount
to
satisfactory
communication
meaningful
conversations
and
emotional
bonds
can
only
truly
be
formed
through
face to face
contact
finally
the
infiltration
of
technology
into
nearly
every
realm
of
our
lives
can
lead
to
overstimulation
and
couldn
t care less
attitudes
as
people
become
too
overwhelmed
or
desensitized
to
take
action
with
many
organizations
facing
budget
cuts
and
an
unpredictable
economy
more
and
more
businesses
and
schools
are
beginning
to
consider
the
idea
of
instituting
a
day
hour
work
week
or
school
week
while
the
idea
of
having
a
three day
weekend
may
seem
appealing
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
that
must
be
considered
before
making
this
switch
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
reducing
the
work
week
or
school
week
to
four
days
is
the
potential
cost
savings
that
can
be
achieved
by
making
the
switch
companies
can
reduce
the
amount
of
energy
they
use
which
can
lead
to
lower
bills
additionally
businesses
can
save
money
by
reducing
the
amount
of
personnel
that
they
need
and
schools
can
save
money
on
things
like
facility
costs
and
transportation
however
there
are
also
numerous
disadvantages
to
instituting
such
a
schedule
for
instance
many
employees
may
struggle
to
stay
focused
during
a
hour
workday
and
may
find
their
productivity
declining
due
to
exhaustion
additionally
students
in
a
longer
school
day
may
have
difficulty
staying
motivated
for
the
extra
two
hours
each
day
ultimately
it
is
important
to
carefully
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
instituting
a
day
hour
work
or
school
week
decisions
should
be
made
based
not
only
on
cost
savings
but
also
on
the
potential
impact
that
such
a
schedule
could
have
on
productivity
morale
and
overall
quality
of
life
the
potential
benefits
of
allowing
visitors
to
tour
a
workplace
are
immense
for
people
who
are
considering
their
future
college
or
course
choices
allowing
them
to
visit
a
workplace
and
learn
more
about
the
various
roles
and
responsibilities
of
those
who
work
there
could
be
invaluable
it
prepares
them
to
make
more
informed
decisions
when
it
comes
to
their
career
paths
by
allowing
people
to
tour
a
workplace
it
can
also
provide
a
unique
perspective
for
people
who
are
interested
in
the
work
being
done
there
seeing
firsthand
the
intricacies
of
a
functioning
successful
business
can
give
visitors
an
understanding
of
how
a
company
operates
and
what
the
job
roles
entail
having
this
insight
can
help
visitors
make
a
more
educated
decision
when
applying
to

understanding
more
clearly
what
they
are
getting
into

also
offers
the
potential
to
benefit
the

the
introduction
of
more
informed
and
engaged
visitors
can
lead
to
increased
consumer
loyalty
improved
understanding
of
company
operations
and
positive

recommendations
furthermore
it
can
increase
brand
recognition
and

draw
new
staff
who
can
bring
fresh
insights
and
innovative
approaches
to
the

in
today
s
competitive
job
market
it
is
essential
for
companies
to
set
themselves
apart
providing
visitors
with
an
opportunity
to

can
be
a
great
way
of
doing
this
allowing
potential
collaborators
to
gain
a
valuable
insight
into
the
company
and
its
values
ultimately
with
the
potential
benefits
that
can
come
from
hosting

it
is
clear
to
see
why
it
can
be
a
valuable
asset
to
companies
once
declared
that
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
his
words
illustrate
the
concept
that
taking
consistent
action
can
be
rewarding
in
prodigious
ways
consistent
action
does
not
merely
mean
physical
action
it
covers
devising
plans
laying
foundations
and
dedicating
time
and
energy
to
a
specific
goal
if
one
chooses
to
be
idle
then
they
are
likely
to
idle
away
the
days
in
procrastination
and
avoidance
but
those
who
understand
the
importance
of
hard
work
and
determination
will
not
sit
by
and
allow
life
to
simply
pass
them
by
instead
they
will
make
use
of
time
using
it
to
hone
their
skills
and
work
towards
the
life
they
hope
to
build
with
consistent
effort
one
can
create
a
lasting
legacy
and
memorable
impact
on
the

persistence
hard
work
and
determination
are
the
hallmarks
of
successful
people
indeed
these
are
the
components
required
to
achieve
any
goal
no
matter
the
size
or
scope
making
the
decision
to
never
be
idle
takes
courage
resolve
and
dedication
yet
they
are
essential
to
progress
to
put
it
simply
results
can
only
come
from
consistent
action
over
an
extended
period
of
time
by
adhering
to
s
quote
and
being
proactive
rather
than
reactive
a
person
stands
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
a
well defined
plan
plus
consistent
implementation
is
the
means
by
which
dreams
are
actualized
the
process
may
be
lengthy
and
laborious
but
the
rewards
are
well
worth
the
effort
forcing
all
students
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
can
be
detrimental
to
their
own
self development
students
should
be
able
to
decide
for
themselves
how
to
spend
their
free
time
as
this
allows
them
to
find
their
own
passions
and
interests
which
can
help
them
to
have
a
successful
and
fulfilling
life
for
example
is
an
academically
driven
student
who
is
extremely
passionate
about
mathematics
and
wants
to
pursue
a
career
in
computer
science
but
due
to
the
principal
s
rule
she
is
forced
to
participate
in
the
school
s
basketball
team
as
a
result
she
lacks
the
time
and
energy
to
focus
on
what
she
actually
loves
which
hinders
her
studies
and
puts
her
future
career
in
jeopardy
on
the
other
hand
is
a
student
who
loves
outdoor
activities
and
pursues
a
career
in
rock
climbing
since
he
does
n t
have
the
same
interests
as
the
rest
of
the
students
and
the
principal
does
n t
provide
options
for
different
extracurricular
activities
is
not
able
to
pursue
his
dream
in
the
school
hours
and
is
limited
in
his
educational
and
career
progress
in
summary
forcing
all
students
to
participate
in
the
same
extracurricular
activities
suppresses
their
individual
self development
and
does
n t
allow
them
to
pursue
the
things
they
are
truly
passionate
about
many
societies
around
the
world
unfortunately
suffer
from
the
pervasive
problem
of
people
not
being
treated
with
kindness
or
respect
this
cultural
trend
can
have
a
powerful
negative
impact
on
individuals
mental
and
emotional
wellbeing
as
their
sense
of
self worth
or
belonging
to
a
community
may
be
profoundly
damaged
additionally
when
exposed
to
continual
disrespect
and
unkindness
it
can
lead
an
individual
to
become
stressed
or
anxious
in
daily
life
and
reduce
their
ability
to
form
meaningful
connections
with
others
on
the
other
hand
treating
others
with
kindness
and
respect
can
be
immensely
beneficial
it
can
foster
an
atmosphere
of
understanding
acceptance
belonging
and
cooperation
not
only
for
the
recipient
but
also
for
the
giver
additionally
it
can
build
and
strengthen
individuals
ability
to
empathize
with
one
another
promoting
a
more
trusting
and
cohesive
society
failure
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
pursuit
of
success
instead
of
viewing
failure
as
a
roadblock
we
should
see
it
as
a
valuable
learning
opportunity
by
taking
risks
and
failing
we
can
develop
a
better
understanding
of
what
works
and
what
does
not
through
analyzing
our
successes
and
failures
we
can
gain
insights
into
the
underlying
skills
necessary
for
achieving
success
we
must
understand
that
failure
is
a
necessary
part
of
growth
and
success
without
failure
we
can
not
appreciate
the
small
victories
and
measures
of
progress
that
occur
on
the
path
to
success
on
the
other

people
to
give
up

discouraging
and
make
the
goal
of
success
seem
like
an
impossible

it
is
important
to
remember
that

and
it
should
not

you
are

a
moment
in

and
a

on

when
i
first
entered
college
i
faced
an
obstacle
of
having
to
manage
my
time
efficiently
between
my
classes
and
job
i
was
working
part time
in
order
to
pay
my
tuition
yet
i
knew
that
meant
i
had
to
put
in
extra
effort
to
make
sure
i
did
n t
fall
behind
in
my
coursework
i
developed
a
schedule
that
involved
setting
time
aside
for
studying
and
writing
assignments
which
i
stuck
to
diligently
no
matter
how
hard
it
was
to
get
through
it
all
i
also
delegated
tasks
that
were
less
important
but
still
needed
to
be
done
like
running
errands
through
my
perseverance
and
hard
work
i
eventually
managed
to
overcome
that
obstacle
and
pass
all
my
classes
the
result
was
success
i
graduated
with
honors
and
a
job
offer
from
my
part time
employer
it
was
a
great
feeling
knowing
that
i
had
risen
above
a
difficult
challenge
and
attained
success
having
the
skill
of
talking
to
people
can
be
incredibly
advantageous
in
social
settings
with
the
ability
to
communicate
complex
ideas
and
express
emotions
effectively
one
can
create
meaningful
conversations
that
can
lead
to
new
and
fruitful
relationships
even
in
the
classroom
having
good
interpersonal
communication
can
help
build
strong
teacher student
relationships
or
even
allow
students
to
help
one
another
with
difficult
concepts
yet
there
are
also
potential
drawbacks
to
having
this
skill
for
instance
talking
too
much
can
be
disruptive
in
a
classroom
setting
or
in
a
professional
setting
making
it
difficult
to
focus
on
the
task
or
goal
at
hand
additionally
being
an
effective
conversationalist
can
require
a
lot
of
energy
making
it
difficult
to
maintain
that
energy
at
all
times
traits
are
essential
tools
in
determining
who
we
are
and
how
we
interact
with
the
world
around
us
whether
we
are
consciously
choosing
our
characteristics
or
they
have
been
molded
by
our
environment
our
traits
have
the
potential
to
profoundly
shape
our
lives
when
individuals
take
on
the
task
of
examining
their
traits
and
actively

which
ones
to

or
abandon
they

satisfaction
with
our
decisions
as
we
are
empowering
ourselves
instead
of
allowing
ourselves
to
be
a
product
of
external
forces
on
the
other
hand
when
character
traits
are
acquired
due
to
outside
circumstances
we
are
left
in
a
vulnerable
state
as
we
are
not
in
control
of
the
messages
conveyed
by
our
traits
depending
on
our
upbringing
peer
group
or
societal
norms
the
traits
that
form
us
can
be
limiting
and
inhibit
us
from
reaching
our
desired
goals
if
we
do
not
question
and
challenge
what
has
been
instilled
in
us
we
may
become
victim
to
our
own
preconceived
beliefs
and
succumb
to
our
environment
s
restrictions

it
is
important
for
us
to

someone
new
we

thoughts

opinions
of
that
person
based

behavior
appearance

interactions

these
impressions
can
change
drastically
after
getting
to
know
a
person
better
and
seeing
multiple
sides
to
their
personality
and
character
personally
i
have
experienced
this
change
in
opinion
firsthand
after
becoming
close
friends
with
one
of
my
colleagues
at
work
i
was
able
to
look
past
the
physical
and
professional
barriers
we
initially
had
between
us
and
appreciate
the
qualities
that
made
them
so
unique
the
same
can
be
said
for
a
friend
i
made
in
college
i
initially
got
the
impression
that
this
person
was
cold
and
unfriendly
however
after
continuing
to
talk
and
hang
out
with
them
i
was
able
to
see
the
friendly
humorous
and
creative
person
they
are
in

is
clear
that
first
impressions
can
be
significantly
altered
after
getting
to
know
someone
better
regardless
of
the
environment
my
own
experience
has
shown
how
the
best
friendships
or
business
relationships
may
often
begin
with
a
completely
different
impression
to
the
one
you
are
left
with
the
is
a
concept
that
emphasizes
striving
for
excellence
in
whatever
one

said
to
be

that
is
constantly
trying

you
something

the
greatest
accomplishment
as

i
ve
come
to
appreciate
and
understand
the
essence
of
his
wise
words
being
yourself
allows
you
to
have
a
sense
of
confidence
and
comfort
in
yourself
and
makes
it
easier
to
express
and
share
your
ideas
with
others
it
helps
us
develop
and
become
better
people
by
allowing
us
to
gain
knowledge
and
experiences
in
life
we
often
face
pressure
to
conform
or
fit
into
certain
social
roles
or
expectations
and
while
it
may
be
easier
to
simply
comply
with
the
status
quo
there
is
nothing
quite
like
finding
the
courage
and
inner
peace
that
comes
from
being
yourself
regardless
of
what
society
thinks
accepting
ourselves
and
who
we
are
is
one
of
the
most
important
steps
we
can
take
in
life
overall
s
words
are
as
relevant
today
as
ever
we
all
need
to
be
reminded
from
time
to
time
why
it
is
so
important
to
be
ourselves
and
to
realize
the
greatness
that
exists
within
all
of
us
despite
the
challenges
that
may
come
our
way
by
being
true
to
ourselves
we
can
find
true
happiness
extending
the
school
day
can
be
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
for
students
on
the
one
hand
four
days
of
school
can
be
fewer
school
days
in
a
week
and
may
allow
students
to
feel
less
overwhelmed
with
work
and
have
more
free
time
to
do
what
they
love
some
educators
and
parents
have
posited
that
students
could
experience
a
work
smarter
not
harder
approach
with
four
days
to
spread
their
work
out
over
the
extended
school
day
promote
student driven
learning
and
potentially
have
classes
that
are
more
engaging
on
the
other
hand
the
extended
school
days
might
put
an
overwhelming
amount
of
pressure
on
students
having
four
days
of
school
instead
of
five
may
result
in
more
hours
of
scarce
study
time
more
challenging
teacher
expectations
and
more
cumulative
material
to
cover
this
could
lead
to
excessive
stress
on
students
longer
days
of
being
in
a
focused
state
and
ultimately
exhaustion
additionally
there
may
be
a
potential
financial
burden
that
may
come
with
the
extended
school
days
such
as
the
need
to
hire
more
staff
and
administration
and
the
potential
for
less
hands on
learning
if
resources
are
cut
despite
the
potential
drawbacks
there
are
potential
benefits
from
having
four
days
of
school
with
the
extended
school
day
students
may
be
able
to
engage
in
more
in depth
learning
be
able
to
learn
at
a
faster
pace
and
have
more
individualized
attention
in
classes
as
the
school
day
is
more
spread
out
it
could
also
result
in
less
time
overall
that
children
spend
on
screens
or
electronic
devices
throughout
the
week
as
they
will
have
more
days
free
to
explore
and
engage
in
activities
with
friends
and
family
in
conclusion
the
pros
and
cons
of
extending
the
school
day
and
having
four
days
a
week
are
complex
and
varied
it
is
essential
that
a
thorough
analysis
of
these
potential
changes
to
the
educational
system
be
done
to
foster
an
environment
that
is
conducive
to
long term
student
success
despite
the
many
hurdles
we
must
all
face
when
attempting
to
achieve
our
goals
the
most
significant
obstacle
we
face
is
often
ourselves
we
tend
to
doubt
our
own
abilities
and
falter
at
times
when
we
should
persist
towards
our
dreams
we
do
n t
often
take
second
chances
when
the
first
fails
and
instead
of
taking
the
advantage
of
our
precious
time
we
give
up
however
it
is
never
too
late
to
change
our
destinies
staying
persistent
and
believing
in
yourself
can
make
all
the
difference
when
it
comes
to
achieving
your
goals
we
must
have
trust
in
ourselves
and
our
own
abilities
as
believing
that
we
can
achieve
our
goals
is
just
as
essential
if
not
more
so
than
actually
doing
the
hard
work
extending
student
release
time
can
have
a
vast
impact
on
a
variety
of
aspects
associated
with
a
school
from
a
student
well being
perspective
extra
time
available
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
activities
and
leisure
which
could
potentially
help
mitigate
stress
and
improve
academic
and
mental
performance
additionally
the
extra
time
might
also
offer
parents
more
flexibility
when
it
comes
to
their
own
work
and
personal
obligations
on
the
other
hand
increased
release
time
could
present
new
challenges
in
terms
of
after school
transportation
as
schools
and
families
may
need
to
adjust
their
schedules
towards
the
new
reality
of
later
release
times
ultimately
the
extent
of
these
implications
will
depend
on
the
type
and
magnitude
of
the
modification
in
student
release
time
success
is
often
a
result
of
failing
multiple
times but
never
losing
motivation
or
enthusiasm
in
the
process
famously
said
that
success
consist
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
and
it
is
important
to
understand
the
meaning
behind
this
statement
if
we
wish
to
be
successful
in
life
encouragement
and
motivation
are
essential
in
order
to
achieve
success
in
life
people
need
to
believe
in
themselves
stay
dedicated
to
their
goals
and
be
passionate
about
what
they
do
in
order
to
be
successful
learning
from
mistakes
is
also
an
important
factor
in
order
to
succeed
people
should
be
willing
to
reflect
on
their
mistakes
and
figure
out
what
they
could
have
done
differently
in
order
to
improve
failing
to
learn
from
mistakes
can
have
disastrous
consequences
as
people
are
prone
to
repeat
them
and
make
the
same
mistakes
over
and
over
again
thus
preventing
them
from
achieving
the
success
they
desire
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
to
understand
the
meaning
behind
s
famous
quote
and
should
carry
motivation
and
dedication
in
order
to
be
successful
as
well
as
learning
from
one
s
mistakes
in
order
to
prevent
failure
in
the
future
having
positive
people
around
us
is
essential
to
maintain
healthy
self esteem
by
this
i
mean
people
who
validate
our
emotions
and
give
us
encouraging
words
these
people
support
us
no
matter
the
situation
believing
in
the
potential
we
have
and
understanding
us
which
in
turn
helps
us
build
more
self confidence
they
help
us
see
that
our
efforts
are
being
noticed
thus
boosting
our
self esteem
on
the
other
hand
it
is
important
to
know
how
to
handle
negative
people
who
want
to
change
us
it
can
be
quite
difficult
to
resist
the
temptation
to
please
them
because
we
want
to
feel
accepted
even
when
this
might
mean
doing
something
against
our
values
however
we
need
to
be
aware
that
these
people
may
have
the
wrong
intentions
and
that
if
we
oblige
to
their
demands
we
might
lose
our
self esteem
in
the
long
run
i
have
experienced
both
scenarios
i
had
a
teacher
who
believed
in
my
abilities
and
she
kept
pushing
me
to
do
more
until
i
achieved
what
i
had
set
out
to
do
this
built
my
self esteem
showing
me
that
i
was
capable
of
much
more
than
i
thought similarly
i
had
a
friend
who
constantly
put
me
down
never
recognizing
the
things
i
did
right
i
ended
up
so
focused
on
pleasing
her
that
i
neglected
my
own
priorities
i
had
to
realize
that
i
had
to
make
my
own
decisions
and
that
i
was
the
one
responsible
for
myself
to
sum
up
the
importance
of
positive
people
is
immense
as
they
help
build
our
self esteem
we
have
to
be
aware
of
the
toxic
impact
negative
people
have
in
our
lives
and
resist
the
temptation
to
please
them
it
is
through
these
experiences
that
we
learn
to
make
decisions
that
best
suit
us
putting
our
own
well being
first
one
of
the
best
ways
to
show
intelligence
is
by
having
a
deep
understanding
of
a
particular
subject
matter
through
diligently
studying
and
researching
facts
about
that
area
of
expertise
an
additional
way
to
show
intelligence
is
working
out
puzzles
and
strategies
for
problem solving
such
as
creating
a
spreadsheet
or
other
type
of
presentation
to
explain
complex
concepts
to
show
off
talents
it
can
include
skills
in
music
art
writing
and
other
creative
talents
for
example
if
someone
is
good
at
playing
the
guitar
and
participating
in
choirs
that
is
one
way
to
demonstrate
their
talent
additionally
someone
who
is
a
skilled
writer
can
demonstrate
their
talent
through
experiences
such
as
writing
short
story
or
articles
for
publications
to
show
off
one
s
athletic
ability
it
can
be
anything
that
involves
physical
strength
flexibility
and
endurance
as
an
example
for
someone
who
wants
to
show
off
their
athletic
ability
they
could
demonstrate
things
such
as
running
weightlifting
or
playing
a
sport
being
able
to
show
how
they
achieve
higher
endurance
by
continually
increasing
times
for
running
a
certain
distance
or
being
able
to
lift
heavier
weights
are
both
ways
to
show
athletic
abilities
the
key
to
each
of
these
skills
is
to
demonstrate
the
qualities
that
make
them
unique
this
could
include
being
able
to
memorize
an
entire
text
book
on
a
certain
subject
or
being
able
to
make
a
beautiful
painting
in
a
short
amount
of
time
being
able
to
explain
why
these
skills
have
been
developed
such
as
growing
up
in
a
particular
environment
or
actively
seeking
out
related
opportunities
gives
it
more
credibility
many
unique
skills
across
different
areas
such
as
intelligence
talent
and
athletic
abilities
all
lend
to
a
person
s
individual
identity
reflecting
on
how
you
have
been
able
to
develop
these
skills
and
demonstrating
how
they
are
unique
from
others
is
a
great
way
to
prove
to
the
world
that
you
possess
a
special
and
rare
combination
of
attributes
extending
the
school
day
to
two
hours
and
condensing
the
school
stay
to
four
days
a
week
could
be
a
beneficial
change
for
many
schools
on
one
hand
having
students
attend
school
four
days
a
week
instead
of
five
days
could
have
a
positive
impact
students
could
gain
more
time
in
their
schedule
to
focus
on
extra curricular
activities
as
well
as
more
family
time
and
other
relaxation
activities
additionally
catching
up
on
missed
assignments
could
become
easier
if
students
have
more
free
time
to
study
while
also
allowing
them
to
dedicate
more
time
to
mastering
the
school
curriculum
on
the
other
hand
having
two hour
classes
instead
of
one hour
classes
could
be
a
challenge
for
many
students
may
become
easily
distracted
leading
to
decreased
learning
opportunities
moreover
distractions
may
increase
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
complete
assignments
which
could
lead
to
students
feeling
overwhelmed
and
stressed
furthermore
having
more
time
for
assignments
could
be
detrimental
for
some
students
who
prefer
less
homework
and
more
free
time
in
conclusion
although
there
are
drawbacks
to
extending
the
school
day
two
hours
and
condensing
the
school
week
to
four
days
the
potential
gains
for
students
make
this
change
an
option
worth
considering
extending
the
school
day
by
one
and
a
half
hours
could
provide
numerous
benefits
for
both
students
and
teachers
alike
for
students
this
extra
time
could
be
used
for
enrichment
activities
such
as
tutoring
clubs
and
elective
courses
this
could
provide
them
with
the
opportunity
to
explore
and
develop
interests
outside
of
the
traditional
curriculum
for
teachers
this
additional
time
could
be
used
to
provide
professional
development
and
mentorship
opportunities
giving
them
the
chance
to
further
develop
their
skills
and
share
knowledge
with
their
colleagues
ultimately
extending
the
school
day
by
one
and
a
half
hours
could
be
an
invaluable
asset
for
both
students
and
teachers
as
being
a
high
school
student
can
be
a
challenging
time
it
is
important
to
consider
the
different
career
options
available
it
is
beneficial
to
reflect
on
not
only
the
career
itself
but
the
benefits
that
can
be
gained
from
such
a
choice
for
example
having
clear
career
objectives
and
commiting
to
this
can
help
to
motivate
students
to
stay
focused
during
their
studies
by
understanding
their
future
goals
and
connecting
these
to
the
learning
process
it
can
help
to
engage
them
in
their
work
and
give
them
a
renewed
energy
for
pursuing
their
dreams
in
addition
having
a
commitment
to
a
career
can
provide
the
focus
and
outcome
necessary
to
have
a
successful
future
by
researching
potential
career
pathways
while
in
high
school
students
can
find
an
option
that
will
best
suit
their
interests
and
provide
the
benefits
needed
to
achieve
success
working
alone
has
many
benefits
that
may
be
overlooked
when
compared
to
working
in
a
group
for
starters
working
alone
can
help
to
echo
back
and
refresh
knowledge
by
teaching
yourself
through
your
own
projects
when
working
alone
one
has
more
time
to
gain
insight
and
understanding
as
there
is
no
need
to
engage
with
others
allowing
you
to
focus
on
the
goal
furthermore
when
working
alone
there
is
no
need
to
compromise
in
order
to
accommodate
opinions
of
others
this
freedom
allows
you
to
push
your
boundaries
and
be
creative
as
you
see
fit
outcomes
are
more
likely
to
be
achieved
when
working
alone
as
there
is
no
getting
caught
up
in
unnecessary
arguments
or
delayed
decision
making
moreover
there
is
no
need
to
share
ideas
or
credit
as
all
ownership
remains
solely
yours
finally
working
alone
helps
increase
confidence
as
you
are
solely
responsible
for
the
outcome
of
the
project
and
can
measure
your
own
capabilities
when
we
consider
the
advantages
of
working
alone
it
is
clear
that
it
can
provide
great
value
when
it
comes
to
developing
knowledge
and
understanding
as
well
as
leading
to
success

students
can

the
topic
of
changing
the
school
lunch
menu
is
highly
important
and
carries
with
it
a
variety
of
advantages
for
students
for
one
students
who
are
typically
unwell
or
have
physical
illnesses
could
greatly
benefit
from
a
menu
that
provides
healthier
and
more
nutritious
meals
additionally
those
who
participate
in
school
sports
could
benefit
from
a
menu
that
is
specifically
tailored
to
ensure
they
are
receiving
the
necessary
vitamins
and
minerals
that
will
help
with
hydration
energy
and
muscle

the
nutritional
requirements
for

ultimately
this
change
could
ensure
that
students
get
the
sustenance
they
need
to
thrive
is
an
invaluable
opportunity
to
learn
valuable
lessons
that
can
stay
with
us
throughout
our
lives
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
students
can
learn
at
school
is
how
to
think
critically
and
objectively
understanding
critical
thinking
can
help
students
develop
better
problem solving
skills
make
more
informed
decisions
and
ultimately
contribute
to
more
successful
outcomes
in
their
future
endeavors
critical
thinking
in
the
classroom
teaches
students
to
think
beyond
what
is
being
presented
to
them
and
to
challenge
assumptions
and
ideas
with
the
help
of
teachers
students
learn
how
to
evaluate
various
sources
of
information
identify
multiple
perspectives
on
an
issue
and
weigh
the
evidence
to
arrive
at
a
reasonable
conclusion
this
can
make
them
better
informed
citizens
better
prepared
in
their
jobs
and
better
able
to
participate
in
critical
conversations
learning
how
to
think
critically
is
also
important
because
it
helps
us
develop
our
own
independent
thought
processes
and
strengthen
our
ability
to
make
our
own
judgments
it
encourages
a
sense
of
curiosity
and
exploration
and
allows
us
to
better
analyze
existing
data
objectively
to
draw
our
own
conclusions
about
the
world
around
us
this
can
help
us
become
more
confident
and
independent
learners
which
can
help
us
in
our
future
studies
and
careers
ultimately
developing
critical
thinking
skills
is
an
essential
life
skill
that
can
benefit
students
in
their
future
it
can
help
them
to
better
make
decisions
more
effectively
participate
in
critical
conversations
and
confidently
navigate
various
challenges
they
may
face
in
their
lives
i
m
currently
exploring
potential
career
paths
that
appeal
to
me
i
ve
been
researching
how
i
can
gain
experience
in
these
fields
such
as
taking
advantage
of
programs
and
clubs
at
my
high
school
i
m
using
resources
like
videos
games
and
movies
to
increase
my
understanding
of
these
fields
while
balancing
fun
activities
my
parents
and
teachers
have
also
been
very
supportive
and
have
given
me
advice
and
advice
on
different
career
paths
i
could
explore
i
m
taking
classes
related
to
my
interest
to
further
my
knowledge
and
help
me
decide
which
career
path
i
want
to
pursue
all
in
all
i
m
taking
these
steps
to
help
me
cultivate
a
successful
and
fulfilling
career
in
the
future
is
an
undeniable
key
to
success
many
of
the
greatest
minds
throughout
history
have
proven
this
to
be
true
especially
in
the
modern
world
with
knowledge
people
are
able
to
confirm
theories
and
construct
pathways
to
progress
on
the
other
hand
imagination
has
its
limitations
while
it
has
the
potential
to
spark
innovation
imagination
alone
can
not
lead
to
certainty
or
progress
without
the
application
of
knowledge
take
for
instance
the
impact
of
the
printing
press
on
the
expansion
of
knowledge
in
before
its
invention
in
europeans
had
to
rely
on
handwritten
texts
limiting
the
spread
of
knowledge
however
s
invention
of
printing
technology
revolutionized
the
way
knowledge
is
distributed
enabling
europeans
to
access
and
record
knowledge
more
quickly
and
accurately
this
is
just
one
example
of
how
knowledge
has
been
used
to
bring
progress
to
our
world
in
contrast
imagination
does
have
its
benefits
it
has
the
capacity
to
provide
fresh
ideas
and
break
the
status
quo
it
can
act
as
a
catalyst
for
creativity
and
exploration
yet
without
a
basis
of
knowledge
these
ideas
can
remain
just
as
stagnant
as
a
wild
thought
ultimately
knowledge
is
essential
for
turning
imaginative
dreams
into
reality
it
is
the
monument
which
plans
and
ideas
are
built
on
no
great
achievement
was
ever
accomplished
without
the
application
of
knowledge
therefore
it
is
clear
that
knowledge
is
more
valuable
than
imagination
alone
excerpt
famously
said
that
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
this
quote
encapsulates
how
failure
hope
and
enthusiasm
are
all
integral
components
in
achieving
success
when
we
face
failure
hope
and
enthusiasm
are
the
sparks
that
help
us
keep
going
and
persevere
in
our
journey
without
hope
it
can
be
easy
to
give
up
when
faced
with
failure
and
without
enthusiasm
hope
can
quickly
turn
into
discouragement
by
combining
the
two
we
are
able
to
face
failure
head on
and
continue
striving
forward
despite
the
setbacks
with
an
enthusiasm
for
the
journey
failure
is
no
longer
a
dead
end
but
rather
a
learning
opportunity
keeps
us
believing
that
if
we
keep
trying
we
can
eventually
reach
success
together
hope
failure
and
enthusiasm
are
the
essential
ingredients
for
success
in
life
starting
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
have
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
for
instance
individuals
who
become
doctors
lawyers
or
teachers
at
a
young
age
may
have
more
energy
and
enthusiasm
for
the
job
and
may
be
able
to
become
masters
of
the
field
earlier
in
life
on
the
other
hand
they
may
lack
experience
and
mentorship
necessary
to
succeed
and
could
be
overwhelmed
by
the
demands
of
those
professions
for
example
doctors
face
long
hours
and
intensive
educational
requirements
and
a
young
doctor
may
not
be
able
to
handle
the
responsibilities
in
contrast
an
experienced
doctor
may
have
the
practical
know how
to
handle
complex
cases
with
greater
ease
young
lawyers
and
teachers
may
struggle
to
manage
the
paperwork
and
classroom
environment
due
to
their
inexperience
overall
starting
a
career
at
a
young
age
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
in
light
of
particular
careers
before
embarking
on
a
new
journey
excerpt
online
classes
have
become
increasingly
popular
offering
students
the
option
to
study
from
home
instead
of
attending
school
in
person
there
are
advantages
to
both
online
and
regular
classes
and
it
depends
on
the
individual
student
to
determine
which
will
be
best
for
them
for
students
attending
classes
in person
one
great
advantage
is
the
social
aspect
they
are
able
to
form
relationships
with
their
peers
and
build
social
skills
furthermore
techniques
such
as
hands on
learning
and
real world
application
are
utilized
and
can
help
students
find
practical
solutions
to
their
problems
however
this
type
of
learning
may
also
be
stressful
for
some
students
as
they
have
to
adjust
to
the
pressures
of
attending
classes
in
a
traditional
environment
studying
online
has
its
advantages
as
well
of
all
the
student
has
more
flexibility
when
it
comes
to
their
studies
since
they
can
set
their
own
schedule
for
when
they
do
their
work
additionally
students
are
not
limited
to
their
physical
location
as
they
can
attend
classes
online
from
anywhere
making
it
easier
for
students
who
have
limited
access
to
physical
classes
on
the
other
hand
the
lack
of
social
interaction
and
the
dependence
on
self motivation
can
be
drawbacks
for
students
who
are
used
to
attending
classes
in person
online
courses
may
not
have
the
same
level
of
resources
as
a
more
traditional
learning
environment
in
conclusion
when
deciding
between
online
and
in person
classes
there
is
no
one size fits all
approach
each
individual
student
needs
to
consider
their
own
personal
preferences
and
skills
to
decide
which
option
best
suits
their
needs
s
words
do
not
go
where
the
path
may
lead
go
instead
where
there
is
no
path
and
leave
a
trail
have
inspired
generations
of
thinkers
to
push
beyond
their
comfort
zones
in
search
of
personal
and
professional
growth
this
idea
can
be
applied
across
a
variety
of
professions
such
as
entrepreneurs
who
must
have
the
courage
to
move
into
uncharted
waters
in
order
to
create
something
new
academics
who
must
stretch
the
boundaries
of
existing
knowledge
and
artists
who
take
risks
in
their
work
in
order
to
break
new
ground
while
professional
sports
players
may
also
strive
to
expand
their
skills
and
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
progress
they
are
somewhat
of
an
exception
to
the
rule
this
is
because
a
successful
sports
career
is
often
based
upon
rigorous
practice
and
training
within
a
pre established
environment
however
even
athletes
must
periodically
challenge
themselves
to
innovate
in
order
to
stay
competitive
looking
beyond
the
realms
of
athletics
examples
of
individuals
being
pushed
out
of
their
comfort
zones
for
growth
can
be
seen
in
numerous
scenarios
from
corporate
looking
for
novel
solutions
to
global
problems
to
everyday
people
looking
to
break
free
from
limiting
circumstances
the
necessity
of
venturing
outside
of
one
s
safely
constructed
realm
of
knowledge
is
a
recurring
theme
is
vital
in
creating
a
strong
foundation
for
relationships
when
both
partners
agree
to
always
tell
the
truth
there
is
a
sense
of
trust
that
is
established
that
feeds
companionship
and
understanding
however
being
too
honest
in
some
situations
can
have
negative
consequences
such
as
causing
unnecessary
hurt
is
important
but
so
is
withholding
harsh
truths
or
sugarcoating
situations
in
a
way
that
preserves
your
relationship
and
your
partner
s
feelings
in
relationships
being
thoughtful
and
understanding
when
it
comes
to
honesty
can
make
all
the
difference
after
researching
different
career
paths
available
i
have
come
up
with
a
list
ones
that
i
am
interested
in
these
include
medical
research

pursue
these
fields

and
am
already
researching
universities
that
i
may
want
to
apply

have
always
been
drawn
to
medical
research
because
i
am
passionate
about
finding
cures
for
life threatening
illnesses
while
business
administration
and
computer
programming
fascinate
me
because
of
the
analytical
and
creative
aspects
of
these
fields
in
terms
of
the
skills
i
possess
to
support
me
with
my
chosen
career
paths
i
have
strong
research
and
problem solving
skills
advanced
writing
abilities
and
i
am
an
effective
independent
worker
my
action
plan
moving
forward
will
include
continuing
to
research
universities
and
programs
that
could
help
me
achieve
my
goals
networking
with
professionals
who
already
work
in
these
industries
so
i
can
get
a
better
understanding
of
what
it
looks
like
to
pursue
these
careers
and
enrolling
in
programs
or
courses
that
can
give
me
the
skills
and
knowledge
i
need
to
stand
out
in
my
chosen
field
i
am
looking
forward
to
taking
the
steps
to
make
my
dreams
a
reality
and
can
not
wait
to
embark
on
this
exciting
journey
to
a
successful
career
nurses
play
an
integral
role
in
healthcare
providing
invaluable
services
to
those
in
need
i
have
extensively
researched
this
amazing
profession
by
reading
books
scouring
online
resources
and
listening
to
stories
from
current
and
former
nurses
from
my
research
i
have
learned
of
the
tremendous
responsibility
nurses
have
in
preserving
and
extending
people
s
lives
through
preventive
healthcare
and
therapeutic
interventions
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
nursing
field
i
have
explored
various
volunteer
opportunities
in
my
local
area
one
particularly
attractive
project
is
interning
at
a
hospital
known
for
its
high
reputation
in
the
area
this
internship
can
provide
countless
benefits
such
as
sharpening
clinical
skills
widening
professional
networks
and
building
practical
knowledge
within
the
healthcare
field
furthermore
this
internship
offers
an
invaluable
opportunity
to
gain
experience
over
the
summer
break
with
the
potential
for
future
career
prospects
with
so
many
different
activities
available
to
enjoy
outdoors
it
can
be
hard
to
know
where
to
start
popular
activities
like
soccer
softball
and
other
sports
activities
offer
a
great
way
to
stay
active
and
have
fun
with
family
and
friends
additionally
there
are
countless
games
and
activities
like
tag
hide
and
seek
and
even
scavenger
hunts
that
can
be
enjoyed
outdoors
physical
exercise
these
outdoor
activities
are
also
beneficial
in
providing
quality
time
between
family
and
friends
there
are
so
many
aspects
that
make
outdoor
activities
enjoyable
from
the
fresh
air
to
the
physical
activities
themselves
it
can
be
the
perfect
way
to
spend
an
afternoon
ultimately
outdoor
activities
have
long
been
a
valuable
part
of
how
we
connect
with
family
and
friends
and
spend
quality
time
together
one
way
to
meet
new
people
without
speaking
is
through
body
language
and
nonverbal
cues
when
you
enter
a
room
look
around
and
make
eye
contact
with
the
people
in
the
room
and
nod
your
head
or
wave
at
people
you
d
like
to
get
to
know
better
it
s
also
easy
to
tell
when
someone
wants
to
stay
to
themselves
or
wants
to
talk
if
someone
is
open
to
conversation
approach
them
slowly
and
calmly
introducing
yourself
with
a
few
details
about
your
life
and or
interests
having
a
pet
is
another
great
way
to
meet
new
people
without
having
to
say
much
animal
lovers
are
naturally
drawn
to
animals
so
if
you
have
a
pet
it
s
likely
you
will
have
conversations
with
those
who
are
also
drawn
to
your
pet
if
you
don
t
have
a
pet
you
can
still
try
to
make
friends
with
people
who
have
one
consider
taking
your
pet
for
a
walk
around
your
neighborhood
and
striking
up
a
conversation
with
the
other
pet
owners
of
course
as
with
any
situation
there
are
potential
positive
and
negative
scenarios
associated
with
meeting
new
people
on
the
positive
side
you
could
make
new
friends
find
a
new
job
or
even
form
a
meaningful
relationship
on
the
negative
side
you
could
experience
bullying
or
rejection
as
long
as
you
stay
open
to
the
possibilities
however
and
use
your
best
judgment
the
potential
positives
far
outweigh
the
target
negatives
was
a
man
that
had
a
dream
of
succeeding
in
an
experiment
he
had
put
time
and
effort
into
despite
failure
after
failure
did
not
lose
hope
he
remained
enthusiastic
and
persistent
and
after
a
total
of
trials
he
achieved
success
this
story
is
an
inspiring
testament
to
the
idea
that
success
can
be
found
through
failure
and
hard
work
despite
the
losses
and
challenges
kept
moving
forward
and
eventually
achieved
his
goal
his
example
reminds
us
that
failure
does
not
have
to
be
the
end
of
a
story
but
could
be
the
beginning
of
something
far
greater
we
can
all
take
something
from
s
resilient
spirit
and
take
on
life
with
enthusiasm
and
resilience
making
mistakes
is
an
often
unfortunate
but
essential
part
of
life
mistakes
can
be
used
as
a
learning
tool
helping
to
shape
our
growth
and
development
as
we
strive
for
success
through
experimentation
and
risk taking
we
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
what
we
need
to
do
to
get
ahead
despite
this
it
is
a
view
that
some
people
may
disagree
with
believing
that
it
is
better
to
take
a
more
cautious
approach
in
order
to
avoid
making
errors
however
it
is
important
to
understand
that
mistakes
can
be
a
part
of
the
successes
that
people
achieve
despite
our
best
intentions
mistakes
are
inevitable
and
can
actually
offer
benefits
for
example
by
understanding
the
consequences
of
our
errors
we
gain
new
skills
and
knowledge
for
future
tasks
and
can
use
this
to
improve
our
performance
over
time
similarly
when
mistakes
are
made
in
our
personal
or
professional
lives
we
can
use
them
as
a
learning
experience
and
implement
better
ways
of
working
ultimately
committing
mistakes
in
life
can
be
beneficial
if
done
in
the
right
way
we
should
acknowledge
that
mistakes
are
simply
part

exploration
can
be
an
intimidating
process
for
many
high
school
students
to
start
it
s
helpful
to
make
a
list
of
some
possible
career
paths
that
interest
you
reflect
on
your
passions
hobbies
and
skillsets
this
will

in

for

supporters
of
allowing
high
school
students
to
complete
their
studies
in
three
years
instead
of
four
may
argue
that
it
saves
students
money
time
and
gives
them
an
extra
year
to
pursue
higher
education
start
a
career
or
travel
from
a
financial
standpoint
three
years
of
high
school
fees
instead
of
four
could
be
a
substantial
saving
for
many
families
yielding
benefits
both
during
and
after
education
time wise
graduating
a
year
early
could
give
students
more
breathing
space
to
explore
their
interests
or
reach
life
goals
more
quickly
however
some
may
worry
that
a
three year
program
may
be
too
fast paced
student
learning
and
development
may
not
be
given
enough
attention
additionally
if
the
program
is
not
well planned
students
may
find
themselves
missing
key
topics
or
skills
furthermore
if
students
are
required
to
take

and
tests
to
graduate
these
may
be

first
impressions
are
incredibly
important
and
our
initial
encounters
with
people
ideas
and
experiences
will
often
set
the
tone
for
our
future
relationships
our
snap
judgement
of
something
or
someone
can
impact
us
for
the
long
haul
and
this
is
especially
true
when
it
comes
to
forming
lasting

it
or
not
our
initial
impressions
have
a

let
s
suppose
that
you
are
starting
at
a
new
school
and
you
have
your
first
encounter
with
the
principal
if
that
first
meeting
goes
well
chances
are
you
will
have
a
good
attitude
about
this
person
and
feel
respected
and
welcomed
however
if
your
first
meeting
with
the
principal
is
unpleasant
you
are
likely
to
treat
them
with
distrust
and
antipathy
and
it
could
color
the
way
you
view
them
for
a
long
time
additionally
our
first
impressions
can
determine
how
we
look
at
the
world
when
we
realize
that
our
instinctive
knee jerk
reactions
and
gut
feelings
about
people
and
situations
should
be
taken
seriously
we
realize
how
much
of
an
impact
they
can
have
on
our
lives
to
illustrate
this
point
let
s
say
that
you
walk
into
a
party
and
you
are
immediately
met
with
a
feeling
of
warmth
and
acceptance
this
can
help
to
shape
the
way
you
feel
about
the
world
and
can
impact
the
way
you
interact
with
the
people
you
meet
from
then
on
on
the
other
hand
if
the
party
is
less
than
hospitable
that
can
lead
you
to
believe
in
a
more
hostile
view
of
the
world
from
these
examples
it
is
clear
that
our
first
impressions
can
be
incredibly
powerful
and
can
have
a
long
lasting
impact
on
our
lives
it
is
essential
to
pay
close
attention
to
these
initial
reactions
and
work
to
make
sure
that
they
are
as
positive
as
possible
by
doing
so
we
can
ensure
that
our
relationships
with
people

my
grandpa
was
born
in
a
small
fishing
village
in
his
family
was
poor
so
there
were
many
difficulties
they
faced
throughout
his
childhood
including
limited
access
to
adequate
nutrition
and
health
care
despite
these
difficulties
his
family
managed
to
make
ends
meet
and
give
him
the
best
life
they
possibly
could
when
he
was
a
young
man
he
immigrated
to
the
alone
seeking
a
better
life
for
himself
and
his
family
the
journey
across
the
ocean
was
full
of
challenges
and
he
was
required
to
leave
his
family
behind
for
the
time
being
once
he
arrived
in
the
he
faced
language
barriers
cultural
differences
and
financial
instability
which
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
settle
in
after
several
years
of
hard
work
was
finally
able
to
save
enough
money
to
bring
his
family
to
the
and
they
were
reunited
after
being
apart
for
many
years
even
though
their
lives
were
still
difficult
in
a
new
country
was
proud
that
he
was
able
to
provide
them
with
a
better
life
and
a
new
start
as
the
old
adage
goes

is
everything
and
it
s
true
having
a
good

can
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
almost
every
area
of
our
lives
from
our
personal
lives

have
a
powerful

an
optimistic
outlook
we
are
more
likely
to
experiment
ask
questions
and
learn
from
our
mistakes
when
our
attitude
is
positive
furthermore
a

outcomes
i
experienced
this
firsthand
when
i
decided
to
take
on
a
big
writing
project
while
i
was
still
in
college
even
though
i
had
no
prior
experience
with
the
type
of
writing
needed
for
the
project
i
was
determined
to
succeed
with
a
positive
attitude
i
approached
the
challenge
head
on
and
worked
diligently
until
the
project
was
complete
in
the
end
the
project
was
a
success
and
i
was
even
able
to
win
a
prize
for
my
work
that
is
an
experience
that
i
will
never
forget
and
i
am
sure
i
would
not
have
been
so
successful
had
i
not
had
a
good
attitude
in

having
a
good
attitude
is
beneficial
on
many
levels

us
the

attitude
can
help
us
to
reach
our
full
potential
and
lead
us
to
success
with
the
emergence
of
technology
distance
learning
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
students
while
distance
learning
has
several
advantages
such
as
allowing
students
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
providing
flexibility
in
how
and
when
they
learn
and
potentially
reducing
the
cost
of
learning
materials
there
are
also
potential
pitfalls
that
must
be
considered
among
these
are
the
potential
for
increased
bullying
due
to
lack
of
direct
supervision
as
well
as
the
potential
distractedness
and
lack
of
social
interaction
associated
with
learning
in
an
unstructured
environment
although
distance
learning
provides
many
benefits
such
as
allowing
students
to
have
more
control
over
their
education
these
same
benefits
can
lead
to
greater
responsibility
for
adolescents
and
as
a
result
increased
potential
for
irresponsibility
this
could
include
dropping
out
of
classes
excessive
procrastination
or
not
following
instructor
directions
all
of
which
will
ultimately
lead
to
a
decline
in
educational
performance
one
group
of
students
that
can
especially
benefit
from
distance
learning
are
those
with
extra
responsibilities
after
school
or
those
looking
to
save
money
not
having
to
worry
about
expensive
transportation
to
and
from
campus
as
well
as
the
freedom
to
take
classes
at
different
times
of
the
day
can
be
incredibly
liberating
and
allow
students
to
focus
on
their
studies
additionally
distance
learning
can
be
an
excellent
way
to
fit
education
into
a
tight
schedule
while
still
advancing
one
s
academic
goals
in
conclusion
distance
learning
is
an
attractive
learning
option
that
can
provide
students
with
much
needed
flexibility
particularly
those
with
extra
responsibilities
but
it
is
not
without
its
own
set
of
challenges
evaluating
the
potential
pros
and
cons
of
distance
learning
can
help
students
make
an
educated
decision
about
the
learning
option
that
is

for
them

snatched
away
from

those

this
is
due
to
many
socioeconomic

leading
to
a
myriad
of
developmental
problems
both
now

later
in

to
protect

those
who
are
struggling

raise
an
abnormal
child
needs
to

chance
of
a
successful

such
resources
may
include
specialized

motivated
develop
our
skills
and
view
difficult
situations
as
opportunities
for
growth
it
also
boosts
our
energy
and
attracts
positive
people
and
experiences
into
our
lives
therefore
developing
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
leading
a
fulfilling
and
successful
life
having
a
good
imagination
is
vital
for
success
in
both
life
and
work
imagination
is
the
key
to
creating
new
ideas
and
making
them
a
reality
additionally
imagination
helps
us
to
identify
understand
and
solve
complex
problems
therefore
having
a
strong
imagination
can
help
us
when
we
are
trying
to
achieve
our
goals
achieving
our
goals
often
requires
a
great
deal
of
effort
and
dedication
without
learning
new
information
or
leveraging
our
knowledge
and
skills
it
can
be
difficult
to
make
progress
having
a
good
understanding
of
what
is
required
to
reach
our
goals
can
be
beneficial
in
particular
having
knowledge
related
to
the
job
we
are
applying
for
is
important
for
example
if
an
individual
is
looking
for
a
job
in
the
tech
industry
they
should
have
a
good
knowledge
of
the
industry
the
role
and
possible
companies
they
could
work
for
quitting
just
one
step
away
from
success
can
be
a
difficult
concept
to
understand
after
all
our
hard
work
it
can
seem
odd
that
the
outcome
is
not
favorable
but
the
importance
of
having
both
an
imagination
and
knowledge
of
the
goal
is
key
in
these
situations
an
individual
may
have
a
brilliant
plan
in
mind
and
think
it
will
be
successful
only
to
find
out
they
are
missing
something
in
this
case
their
lack
of
knowledge
was
their
downfall
and
they
failed
to
achieve
success
even
though
they
were
so
close
to
success
one
example
of
how
imagination
and
knowledge
led
to
success
is
the
story
of
used
his
knowledge
of
the
internet
and
his
imagination
to
envision
what
the
online
shopping
experience
could
be
like
he
used
this
knowledge
and
his
vision
to
create
which
is
now
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
world
his
imaginative
and
entrepreneurial
spirit
has
allowed
him
to
build
an
empire
and
achieve
incredible
success
in
conclusion
achieving
success
requires
effort
imagination
and
knowledge
without
all
three
it
is
unlikely
that
our
goals
will
be
achieved
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
different
elements
required
to
reach
success
and
understand
how
they
can
work
together
to
create
success
according
to
research
expecting
students
to
identify
a
career
by
the
time
they
enter
high
school
can
have
many
advantages
particularly
in
terms
of
giving
students
an
early
start
to
focusing
on
preparation
for
their
desired
career
such
preparation
might
involve
taking
relevant
classes
or
courses
engaging
in
internships
participating
in
job
shadowing
experiences
or
joining
extracurricular
activities
in
their
desired
career
field
this
early
start
could
give
students
an
edge
when
it
comes
to
getting
accepted
into
college
and or
the
job
of
their
choice
after
graduation
however
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
students
deciding
on
a
career
choice
late
in
their
educational
timeline
for
example
the
more
narrow
timeframe
could
cause
them
to
feel
overwhelmed
and
less
likely
to
take
the
steps
mentioned
above
to
adequately
prepare
this
could
have
serious
negative
implications
for
the
student
s
future
as
a
lack
of
preparation
may
lead
to
less
desirable
college
and
job
choices
there
are
also
various
reasons
why
some
students
put
off
deciding
on
a
career
these
can
range
from
lack
of
knowledge
about
possibilities
fear
of
making
the
wrong
decision
or
simply
feeling
unready
to
commit
to
one
career
option
it
is
important
for
students
to
realize
that
they
have
plenty
of
time
to
hone
in
on
their
career
choice
and
that
they
do
not
need
to
make
a
final
decision
before
they
start
their
high
school
journey
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
they
set
the
tone
for
the
duration
of
a
relationship
or
interaction
and
because
of
this
importance
people
are
likely
to
remember
a
poor
first
impression
for
a
long
time
it
is
difficult
to
rewire
the
initial
feeling
of
dislike
distrust
or
distaste
towards
a
person
once
it
has
been
established
for
instance
if
someone
has
made
a
wildly
inappropriate
joke
or
done
something
else
disrespectful
in
their
introduction
it
is
almost
improbable
to
get
someone
to
change
their
opinion
of
that
person
and
see
them
in
a
different
light
personal
experiences
are
the
most
illustrative
examples
demonstrating
the
permanence
of
first
impressions
i
remember
meeting
a
friend
s
new
partner
for
the
first
time
and
being
thoroughly
unimpressed
by
his
behavior
he
was
rude
and
had
a
flippant
attitude
and
i
instantly
disliked
him
even
though
i
have
seen
him
multiple
times
since
then
and
can
see
him
making
an
effort
to
show
a
different
character
he
has
never
been
able
to
shake
off
that
feeling
of
dislike
that
i
got
from
the
first
impression
it
is
unfortunately
this
way
with
almost
all
relationships
and
ways
of
interacting
with
people
which
further
emphasizes
why
first
impressions
are
so
important
and
why
it
is
vital
that
we
try
and
ensure
people
get
the
best
version
of
ourselves
from
the
beginning
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
change
the
feeling
associated
with
a
first
impression
so
care
must
be
taken
to
ensure
it
is
a
good
one
playing
sports
can
be
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
stay
active
socialize
with
peers
and
learn
important
skills
however
playing
a
sport
as
a
student
also
has
its
own
unique
set
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
positive
side
playing
a
sport
can
improve
physical
fitness
and
help
students
develop
important
life
skills
such
as
teamwork
communication
discipline
and
goal
setting
additionally
participating
in
a
team
sport
can
provide
students
with
a
unique
outlet
for
stress
relief
an
opportunity
to
make
friends
and
even
a
sense
of
accomplishment
from
winning
games
or
tournaments
on
the
other
hand
playing
a
sport
can
be
time consuming
and
expensive
in
addition
to
the
cost
of
equipment
uniforms
and
fees
associated
with
joining
a
team
students
may
need
to
invest
a
great
deal
of
time
into
practices
games
and
travel
furthermore
injury
is
always
a
risk
when
playing
a
sport
and
can
often
lead
to
feelings
of
disappointment
or
even
depression
lastly
the
pressure
to
win
or
perform
well
can
be
overwhelming
for
some
students
potentially
leading
to
anxiety
or
a
negative
experience
overall
in
conclusion
playing
a
sport
can
be
an
incredibly
rewarding
experience
for
students
as
it
helps
develop
a
range
of
important
life
skills
allows
for
stress
relief
and
provides
a
sense
of
purpose
however
it
important
for
students
to
weigh
the
costs
to
balance
the
risks
mentally
prepare
for
the
inevitable
setbacks
and
choose
a
sport
that
is
enjoyable
for
them
dear
i
am
writing
to
suggest
the
introduction
of
a
program
that
would
allow
our
students
to
explore
certain
occupations
through
internships
and
shadowing
opportunities
such
programs
would
help
give
our
students
valuable
insight
into
professional
fields
of
interest
and
provide
them
with
crucial
job skill
training
for
instance
we
could
encourage
students
to
take
field
trips
to
local
businesses
community
events
and
job
fairs
this
would
give
them
a
chance
to
learn
from
professionals
in
various
industries
about
topics
such
as
credit
cards
finance
marketing
and
customer
service
furthermore
these
trips
could
also
serve
as
an
opportunity
to
explore
and
appreciate
nature
as
we
could
organize
field
trips
to
nearby
parks
gardens
and
nature
preserves
this
program
would
benefit
our
students
significantly
it
would
both
broaden
their
knowledge
of
important
social
topics
and
give
them
a
better
sense
of
their
career
goals
it
would
also
teach
them
key
skills
necessary
to
succeed
in
the
workplace
you
for
considering
this
proposal
i
look
forward
to
hearing
your
thoughts
sincerely
in
recent
years
programs
featuring
older
students
helping
younger
students
have
been
growing
in
popularity
these
programs
are
designed
to
teach
the
younger
generations
a
variety
of
skills
such
as
walking
social
etiquette
and
respect
for
others
it
is
believed
that
these
programs
not
only
provide
educational
opportunities
but
also
open
job
prospects
and
give
participants
the
chance
to
explore
talents
they
may
never
have
realized
before
moreover
programs
like
these
could
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
environment
for
example
an
increase
in
mentorship
opportunities
for
younger
generations
may
lead
to
increased
understanding
and
appreciation
for
nature
many
countries
around
the
world
have
implemented
similar
programs
tailored
to
their
specific
objectives
for
instance
in
there
s
a
program
called
udvekslingsstudent
in
which
older
students
from
danish
high
schools
mentor
their
younger
counterparts
in
both
academics
and
extracurricular
activities
in
the
states
the
brothers
big
sisters
program
operates
on
a
national
level
pairing
older
students
with
at risk
youth
in
an
effort
to
provide
mentorship
and
guidance
all
in
all
programs
involving
older
students
helping
younger
students
provide
a
great
benefit
for
all
involved
as
well
as
for
the
environment
with
more
research
more
organizations
and
countries
may
deploy
these
programs
in
the
future
s

try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already

will
never
grow
rings
true
in
my
own
life
and
through
studying
the
experiences
of

amateur
soccer
player
i
never
took

if
i
chose

i
would
have
had
to
try
something
far
beyond
what
i
had
already
mastered
by
pushing
myself
to
my
limits
and
rise
to
the
challenge
i
would
have
found
a
way
to
develop
my
skills
even
further
and
grow
both
on
and
off

can

in
conclusion
s
quote
holds
true
in
our
lives
we
must
be
willing
to
solve
puzzles
explore
past
boundaries
and
take
risks
in
order
to
grow
and
become
the
best
versions

community
service
may
be
an
effective
tool
in
helping
students
to
develop
empathy
and
civic
engagement
through
this
students
will
become
familiar
with
the
rewards
of
helping
underserved
populations
understanding
the
struggles
of
those
less
fortunate
than
themselves
not
only
would
this
help
students
become
more
engaged
citizens
but
it
would
also
create
an
avenue
of
connection
between
students
of
different
backgrounds
would
benefit
from
having
students
with
a
more
developed
sense
of
responsibility
and
compassion
as
well
as
increased
camaraderie
between
students
the
end
result
is
young
people
with
the
ability
to
be
more
civically
engaged
in
their
future
life
and
work
as
well
as
more
connected
within
a
diverse
community
the
feeling
of
being
challenged
to
push
beyond
my
limits
is
one
that
will
always
stay
with
me
it
was
a
couple
of
months
ago
when
i
had
been
pushing
myself
to
train
for
an
upcoming
competition
as
i
was
working
harder
every
day
i
could
feel
myself
growing
stronger
and
more
confident
the
challenge
started
to
become
exciting
and
i
found
myself
wanting
to
do
even
more
i
was
motivated
to
improve
my
performance
and
really
challenged
myself
to
reach
the
highest
possible
standard
the
experience
taught
me
that
when
you
challenge
yourself
you
can
truly
reach
levels
you
never
thought
possible
it
opened
my
eyes
to
what
i
was
capable
of
and
showed
me
that
perseverance
can
pay
off
in
the
end
i
not
only
achieved
my
original
goal
but
also
grew
as
a
person
learning
to
take
on
tougher
tasks
and
become
a
better
version
of
myself
spending
time
outdoors
has
many
benefits
that
often
go
overlooked
playing
sports
and
engaging
in
physical
activity
encourages
social
interaction
reduces
stress
and
anxiety
and
of
course
keeps
us
fit
and
healthy
has
its
own
set
of
unique
benefits
such
as
encouraging
mindfulness
and
a
connection
with
nature
improving
physical
and
mental
health
and
can
even
act
as
a
form
of
therapy
exercising
outdoors
has
proven
to
be
an
effective
way
of
boosting
self esteem
managing
negative
thoughts
and
managing
stress
spending
time
outdoors
can
lead
to
a
healthier
and
more
fulfilling
lifestyle
studies
have
demonstrated
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
make
a
drastic
impact
on
a
person
s
career
personal
life
and
relationships
in
one
example
from
a
prominent
business
executive
remarked
that
the
most
exciting
part
of
his
job
was
his
positive
attitude
and
his
willingness
to
see
challenges
as
opportunities
rather
than
barriers
he
was
able
to
rise
in
the
ranks
of
his
industry
and
inspire
others
with
his
optimism
and
enthusiasm
the
impact
of
developing
a
positive
attitude
is
immense
people
with
positive
attitudes
often
display
higher
self confidence
increased
motivation
improved
concentration
and
greater
engagement
with
day to day
tasks
additionally
having
a
positive
attitude
can
cultivate
emotional
resilience
and
help
reduce
stress
and
anxiety
those
looking
to
develop
a
more
positive
attitude
can
start
by
engaging
in
positive
self talk
being
mindful
of
their
thoughts
and
watching
for
signs
of
pessimistic
thinking
additionally
it
can
be
useful
to
surround
oneself
with
positive
people
take
breaks
from
negative
influences
and
focus
on
the
positive
aspects
of
oneself
and
one
s
life
although
having
a
positive
attitude
has
a
plethora
of
benefits
there
can
indeed
be
downsides
positive
thinking
can
lead
to
denial
of
the
realities
of
the
world
and
gloss
over
potential
dangers
to
safeguard
against
this
it
is
essential
to
remember
to
stay
grounded
in
reality
and
remain
open
to
constructive
criticism
and
negative
information
in
a
world
filled
with
countless
sources
of
advice
it
can
be
difficult
to
remain
true
to
ourselves
it
is
so
easy
to
conform
to
societal
norms
and
expectations
and
there
is
often
a
subtle
yet
relentless
pressure
to
do
so
was
keenly
aware
of
this
fact
and
famously
professed
that
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
as
such
it
is
vitally
important
to
work
individually
in
order
to
achieve
great
personal
successes
by
working
independently
we
can
discover
and
nurture
our
own
interests
and
passions
in
addition
to
developing
our
own
unique
sets
of
skills
and
capabilities
through
self reflection
and
personal
assessment
we
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
ourselves
both
our
strengths
and
weaknesses
furthermore
taking
the
time
to
engage
in
personal
development
activities
can
help
us
become
more
confident
in
our
abilities
and
cultivate
a
better
sense
of
self
learning
how
to
think
speak
and
act
for
ourselves
can
also
help
us
persevere
even
in
the
face
of
adversity
rather
than
following
the
crowd
standing
up
for
our
beliefs
and
working
toward
our
own
individual
goals
can
often
be
a
source
of
pride
and
satisfaction
it
can
also
open
doors
to
many
educational
and
professional
opportunities
that
we
may
not
have
been
able
to
pursue
otherwise
finally
valuing
our
individual
identities
and
successes
can
make
us
all
the
more
valuable
in
any
team
environment
after
all
our
unique
perspectives
and
abilities
can
create
synergy
and
bring
success
to
any
group
by
working
individually
and
finding
the
courage
to
be
true
to
ourselves
we
can
truly
make
a
positive
impact
on
the
people
and
world
around
us
break
has
long
been
a
staple
of
the
school
year
for
students
and
is
widely
viewed
as
an
important
facet
of
traditional
education
on
the
one
hand
there
are
many
benefits
to
having
a
summer
break
for
example
after
spending
a
long
school
year
focusing
their
energies
on
their
studies
the
break
allows
students
to
rest
and
recuperate
helping
them
to
re energize
and
avoid
burnout
students
can
use
the
break
to
engage
in
activities
which
supplement
their
education
such
as
volunteering
attending
summer
camps
or
taking
classes
that
their
school
does
n t
offer
on
the
other
hand
some
argue
that
the
gap
in
learning
that
can
occur
over
a
summer
break
results
in
a
brain
drain
which
can
set
back
students
academic
performance
upon
returning
to
school
each
year
studies
have
shown
however
that
the
impact
of
the
summer
vacation
on
student
achievement
is
modest
and
that
overall
the
positive
effects
of
having
a
break
outweigh
the
negatives
after
doing
some
research
i
discovered
that
the
job
i
m
most
interested
in
pursuing
is
software
engineering
i
then
read
about
the
skills
and
education
requirements
for
this
position
and
learned
that
it
includes
studying
computer
science
programming
and
data
analysis
in
order
to
further
develop
the
skills
i
need
to
succeed
in
this
field
i
m
taking
part
in
an
internship
program
and
supplementing
my
learning
with
online
courses
i
m
also
taking
the
advantage
of
committing
to
my
chosen
career
at
an
early
age
as
this
will
give
me
the
resources
i
need
to
advance
my
knowledge
and
be
in
the
best
possible
position
to
find
a
job
later
down
the
line
beyond
my
current
education
and
internship
i
m
developing
a
plan
to
ensure
i
have
the
necessary
skills
and
experiences
to
excel
in
my
desired
career
this
includes
networking
with
people
in
the
software
engineering
community
attending
conferences
and
trade
shows
related
to
the
field
and
developing
my
portfolio
to
demonstrate
specific
abilities
and
successes
making
a
good
first
impression
is
a
key
element
of
life
and
is
often
what
determines
our
success
in
various
aspects
from
making
friends
and
maintaining
relationships
to
performing
well
in
job
interviews
or
school
presentations
our
personality
actions
and
even
the
way
we
dress
can
all
directly
affect
another
person
s
view
of
us
and
first
impressions
can
be
incredibly
durable
firstly
our
personality
can
make
someone
feel
comfortable
and
at
ease
or
it
can
cause
them
to
feel
uneasy
and
intimidated
being
friendly
engaging
and
having
humility
with
a
touch
of
assertiveness
is
often
the
best
way
to
make
a
good
first
impression
being
attentive
and
having
an
energetic
presence
in
conversations
can
show
that
we
are
putting
forth
effort
to
make
an
impact
next
the
actions
we
take
can
also
go
a
long
way
in
making
a
good
first
impression
polite
and
having
good
manners
can
be
beneficial
as
well
as
showing
gratitude
and
appreciation
for
any
help
or
guidance
received
paying
attention
to
personal
hygiene
should
also
not
be
overlooked
in
addition
the
clothes
we
wear
can
project
an
image
and
also
make
a
lasting
impression
some
situations
call
for
more
formal
attire
like
job
interviews
which
create
an
air
of
professionalism
while
more
casual
settings
may
call
for
an
outfit
that
can
still
be
maintained
to
look
neat
while
being
comfortable
for
example
a
job
interview
would
not
be
the
best
place
to
dress
too
casually
as
this
could
give
the
impression
that
you
do
not
take
the
situation
seriously
by
being
conscious
of
our
personality
actions
and
clothing
we
can
make
a
good
first
impression
in
a
number
of
scenarios
this
can
open
up
doors
for
us
both
in
terms
of
personal
relationships
and
job
opportunities
good
first
impressions
can
also
help
us
build
trust
with
our
peers
or
colleagues
which
can
have
a
positive
effect
within
a
team
environment
taking
the
time
to
make
sure
that
our
first
impression
is
positive
and
memorable
can
pay
off
in
the
long
run
the
traditional
year
high
school
program
is
an
opportunity
for
many
students
to
take
advantage
of
the
available
resources
and
academic
opportunities
available
in
their
school
setting
but
some
students
may
choose
to
take
classes
in
the
summer
or
during
evenings
for
a
variety
of
reasons
taking
courses
during
these
times
can
be
incredibly
useful
but
there
are
also
some
potential
drawbacks
such
as
reduced
access
to
resources
it
is
also
important
for
high
school
students
to
make
the
most
of
their
free
time
in
an
effective
and
productive
manner
this
is
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
invest
in
themselves
and
focus
on
their
studies
and
extracurricular
activities
additionally
a
high
school
diploma
is
an
invaluable
asset
that
can
open
many
doors
and
should
not
be
taken
lightly
additionally
staying
in
school
every
single
day
provides
a
nurturing
environment
and
the
possibility
of
making
invaluable
connections
finally
success
in
high
school
often
comes
with
hard
work
and
dedication
applying
pressure
to
yourself
to
succeed
has
its
benefits
but
it
can
also
be
detrimental
if
it
is
not
used
in
the
right
way
it
is
important
to
understand
both
the
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
applying
pressure
in
order
to
achieve
success
when
it
comes
to
working
with
a
group
there
are
several
benefits
one
major
benefit
is
the
exchange
of
cultural
knowledge
between
group
members
working
in
a
group
encourages
people
to
learn
from
each
other
and
to
share
both
their
commonalities
and
differences
it
also
encourages
the
development
of
communication
and
language
skills
as
it
provides
an
often
fun
environment
to
practice
the
use
of
language
in
different
contexts
working
with
a
group
also
provides
support
to
each
group
member
as
individuals
learn
from
each
other
and
share
experiences
furthermore
the
effectiveness
of
group
work
in
terms
of
learning
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
higher
when
compared
to
learning
on
an
individual
basis
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
working
with
a
group
is
that
it
can
be
time
consuming
and
can
lead
to
teamwork
issues
if
proper
guidelines
are
not
followed
the
effects
of
a
school
day
of
hours
versus
a
school
day
of
hours
on
students
teachers
and
a
school
as
a
whole
can
be
both
beneficial
and
detrimental
for
students
a
school
day
of
hours
provides
more
opportunities
to
connect
with
teachers
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
and
explore
interests
outside
of
the
classroom
however
it
can
also
lead
to
stress
anxiety
and
lack
of
sleep
for
students
for
teachers
a
school
day
of
hours
provides
more
time
for
lesson
planning
and
preparation
but
it
can
also
lead
to
an
increased
workload
and
feeling
of
burnout
for
the
school
as
a
whole
hours
provides
better
opportunities
for
collaboration
and
participation
in
after school
programs
but
it
can
also
lead
to
higher
operational
and
maintenance
costs
ultimately
the
best
choice
may
depend
upon
the
specific
needs
of
the
school
the
advantages
of
taking
classes
online
or
via
video
conferencing
are
a
great
option
for
students
who
can
not
pay
for
college
as
well
as
those
who
had
previously
been
unable
to
go
to
college
due
to
financial
reasons
classes
can
give
students
who
are
working
and
going
to
school
at
the
same
time
the
flexibility
they
need
to
manage
their
time
and
responsibilities
additionally
with
the
growing
issue
of
limited
parking
space
on
college
campuses
online
classes
can
alleviate
a
large
amount
of
stress
on
students
as
commuting
is
no
longer
a
requirement
for
attending
class
online
classes
can
also
provide
students
with
a
focused
environment
to
learn
without
having
to
worry
about
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
a
traditional
campus
setting
staying
active
is
an
important
part
of
achieving
a
sense
of
accomplishment
physical
activity
not
only
has
the
benefit
of
improved
physical
health
but
also
positive
mental
and
emotional
wellbeing
regular
exercise
releases
feel good
endorphins
and
can
reduce
stress
if
individuals
feel
like
they
are
working
towards
a
goal
such
as
an
increased
level
of
fitness
this
can
be
a
great
source
of
motivation
to
stay
active
moreover
taking
part
in
physical
activities
can
be
a
great
way
to
connect
with
other
people
fostering
a
sense
of
belonging
to
the
community
activities
can
help
to
build
self confidence
determine
core
values
and
help
in
making
positive
choices
by
increasing
knowledge
and
understanding
allocating
time
for
activities
no
matter
how
big
or
small
is
crucial
in
cultivating
a
habit
it
is
all
about
finding
and
creating
motivation
through
developing
skills
setting
objectives
and
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
about
progress
the
implementation
of
a
school
homework
club
could
be
beneficial
in
alleviating
student
stress
providing
a
place
for
collaboration
and
peer mentoring
and
boosting
academic
performance
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
issues
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
before
implementing
a
homework
club
for
example
the
cost
of
hiring
tutors
and
staff
for
the
club
the
stress
this
may
cause
for
those
already
struggling
with
school
the
need
for
a
clearly defined
structure
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
club
is
not
just
competitive
but
also
encouraging
and
supportive
of
all
students
additionally
it
is
important
to
consider
how
the
club
may
alter
students
regular
routine
and
the
need
to
provide
adequate
security
and
supervision
for
the
club
ultimately
with
careful
thought
and
organization
a
homework
club
can
be
a
beneficial
addition
to
a
school
s
programming
it
is
crucial
to
understand
that
our
behavior
can
greatly
influence
the
actions
of
those
around
us
this
is
especially
true
when
it
comes
to
children
who
may
look
up
to
adults
and
imitate
their
behavior
modeling
bad
behavior
can
lead
to
a
wide
array
of
consequences
from
difficulty
adhering
to
societal
norms
to
potentially
having
a
bad
record
especially
when
it
comes
to
attempting
to
travel
abroad
therefore
it
is
vital
to
educate
children
on
the
value
of
good
behavior
so
they
can
make
positive
contributions
to
society
and
live
up
to
their
potential
educating
children
on
good
behavior
can
also
benefit
the
surrounding
communities
as
it
promotes
a
better
understanding
of
cultural
norms
and
responsibilities
and
encourages
positive
interactions
between
people
it
is
important
to
remember
that
how
we
act
can
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
development
of
future
generations
first
impressions
are
powerful
and
can
often
inform
the
duration
of
a
relationship
despite
the
fact
that
a
person
s
first
impression
of
someone
can
drastically
change
over
time
we
often
assume
that
they
will
stay
the
same
for
example
i
used
to
think
of
a
close
friend
of
mine
as
loud
and
slightly
obnoxious
after
getting
to
know
him
however
i
discovered
his
joy
for
life
quick
wit
and
contagious
laughter
through
our
deepening
conversations
i
began
to
see
a
different
side
to
him
and
my
first
impression
changed
completely
in
another
instance
i
initially
thought
a
colleague
of
mine
was
very
aloof
after
working
with
them
for
a
while
however
i
saw
that
they
were
highly
motivated
passionate
about
their
work
and
always
willing
to
help
out
others
those
initial
impressions
changed
and
we
now
have
a
good
working
relationship
ultimately
this
shows
that
first
impressions
are
often
fleeting
and
can
easily
change
upon
further
interaction
recent
research
has
indicated
that
there
are
many
potential
benefits
to
having
students
engage
in
litter
pickup
and
community
service
such
as
fostering
a
stronger
connection
to
the
community
and
increasing
social emotional
skills
these
activities
can
even
help
to
build
leadership
skills
and
reduce
feelings
of
helplessness
in
teenagers
for
parents
there
are
also
peace
of
mind
benefits
knowing
their
teens
are
involved
in
community
service
activities
with
positive
adult
oversight
can
help
foster
mature
decision making
however
there
are
some
risks
associated
with
these
activities
for
example
some
students
may
not
be
comfortable
or
feel
safe
doing
such
activities
alone
in
addition
these
activities
can
become
costly
for
cash strapped
school
districts
finally
they
are
labor intensive
tasks
that
administrators
must
manage
to
ensure
safety
and
compliance
with
state
guidelines
given
this
research
it
is
clear
that
proactively
engaging
students
in
community
service
activities
can
certainly
have
a
positive
effect
on
a
student
s
physical
and
mental
health
and
can
create
a
stronger
sense
of
camaraderie
and
involvement
in
their
community
however
school
administrators
must
put
safety
and
cost
considerations
first
ensuring
that
both
students
and
school
staff
are
comfortable
with
the
activities
and
that
the
added
costs
are
covered
with
careful
consideration
and
proper
oversight
it
is
possible
that
principals
should
require
students
to
participate
in
these
activities
the
accomplishments
of
van
and
da
have
had
an
immense
impact
on
society
leaving
an
indelible
mark
on
our
history
and
culture
these
renowned
individuals
triumphed
over
obstacles
in
both
physical
and
intellectual
endeavors
paving
the
way
for
ground breaking
discoveries
in
the
fields
of
science
philosophy
and
the
arts
what
made
them
stand
out
was
their
ability
to
think
outside
the
box
and
push
themselves
to
explore
unexplored
areas
for
instance
developed
his
groundbreaking
laws
of
motion
while
wrote
some
of
the
most
renowned
works
of
literature
in
history
although
it
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
any
one
factor
that
led
to
their
success
it
is
clear
that
in
order
for
people
to
flourish
intellectually
they
must
be
provided
the
right
combination
of
stimulation
and
encouragement
for
instance
teachers
and
mentors
can
help
their
students
cultivate
inquisitiveness
and
be
courageous
in
tackling
new
challenges
the
right
environment
can
motivate
individuals
to
think
beyond
conventional
methods
and
put
their
creative
skills
to
use
knowledge
sharing
and
collaboration
also
plays
an
essential
role
as
it
creates
an
environment
wherein
the
exchange
of
ideas
can
result
in
amazing
discoveries
finally
while
new
discoveries
can
have
positive
effects
on
society
they
can
also
have
unintended
consequences
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
take
appropriate
measures
to
ensure
that
the
process
of
invention
and
innovation
occurs
responsibly
to
ensure
this
proper
research
should
be
conducted
before
any
discovery
is
put
to
use
and
the
consequences
must
be
studied
to
ensure
that
they
are
beneficial
to
society
in
conclusion
van
and
da
are
prime
examples
of
individuals
who
rose
above
their
circumstances
and
pushed
themselves
to
explore
new
ideas
and
create
lasting
change
it
is
necessary
to
provide
the
right
combinations
of
motivation
and
support
to
encourage
people
to
think
beyond
conventional
boundaries
and
make
new
discoveries
in
addition
these
discoveries
must
be
made
responsibly
with
the
proper
research
and
precautions
being
taken
to
ensure
that
the
changes
are
in
the
best
interest
of
society
in
recent
years
many
local
companies
and
organizations
have
implemented
initiatives
to
better
engage
with
students
from
different
schools
employers
have
provided
support
in
order
to
encourage
student
involvement
in
various
professions
this
helps
to
provide
students
with
an
insight
into
the
real world
of
work
however
there
are
still
a
multitude
of
issues
that
students
face
when
attempting
to
join
a
profession
for
one
many
employers
may
not
provide
adequate
guidance
and
counseling
to
the
students
on
how
to
pursue
the
profession
they
are
interested
in
additionally
there
is
a
lack
of
networking
opportunities
among
the
local
organizations
making
it
difficult
for
students
to
build
relationships
for
possible
job
openings
there
are
several
solutions
that
could
be
put
forward
to
make
the
experience
of
students
attempting
to
join
a
profession
better
for
one
employers
should
strive
to
create
more
frequent
networking
opportunities
with
other
organizations
so
students
can
have
access
to
more
resources
and
advice
additionally
organizations
should
offer
more
career counseling
sessions
for
students
to
help
them
become
better
acquainted
with
the
required
steps
towards
joining
a
profession
our
society
today
often
tends
to
favor
conformity
over
individuality
due
to
certain
social
pressures
that
limit
creative
thinking
and
encourage
sameness
this
can
be
seen
in
the
way
people
think
dress
and
act
opting
for
the
safety
of
conformity
and
the
group
mindset
in
order
to
fit
in
as
the
essay
mentions
facilitates
consensus
and
thus
generates
security
and
stability
within
a
society
people
prefer
certainty
and
will
often
limit
their
independent
thinking
in
order
to
blend
in
this
mentality
can
also
be
found
in
the
job
market
where
having
unique
skills
or
ideas
are
often
not
valued
and
may
even
be
seen
as
a
disadvantage
people
are
often
judged
harshly
for
expressing
their
own
thoughts
or
ideas
that
deviate
from
what
is
considered
normal
in
conclusion
in
our
society
today
conformity
is
often
favored
over
individuality
finding
a
talent
or
skill
can
be
a
difficult
task
but
with
a
bit
of
brainstorming
and
research
you
may
find
something
that
sparks
your
interest
by
looking
into
the
activities
and
interests
you
already
have
and
evaluate
them
to
see
if
any
could
be
turned
into
a
talent
or

from
there
begin
researching
tips
on
discovering
a
talent
or
skill
and
explore
different
strategies
to

you
find
what

for
make

of
activities
that
may
lead
to

find
interests
or
activities
you
have
n t
encountered
before
once
you
have
a
chosen
talent
or
skill
explore
how
they
can
be
used
in
a
career
and
begin
to
analyze
how
it
could
benefit
you
the
power
of
positive
feedback
from
teachers
should
not
be
underestimated
as
a
student
being
acknowledged
for
our
hard
work
and
achievements
can
inject
us
with
a
great
sense
of
determination
and
self confidence
to
strive
for
even
greater
heights
for
example
when
i
was
younger
i
remember
feeling
so
proud
when
my
math
teacher
praised
me
for
studying
hard
and
for
scoring
well
on
my
tests
this
recognition
kept
me
motivated
to
dive
even
deeper
into
the
subject
matter
and
tackle
every
challenging
problem
i
encountered
with
enthusiasm
in
addition
to
this
when
a
student
knows
that
their
teacher
expects
them
to
succeed
they
will
feel
more
confident
in
their
abilities
with
the
right
guidance
and
support
even
intimidating
tasks
can
be
tackled
confidently
as
an
example
a
language
teacher
of
mine
once
told
me
that
she
knew
i
could
master
a
difficult
syntax
exercise
if
i
put
in
enough
effort
this
pushed
me
to
overcome
my
fear
of
failure
and
encouraged
me
to
stay
determined
to
complete
the
task
overall
when
teachers
recognize
and
undercut
the
effort
that
their
students
put
into
their
work
it
creates
a
strong
sense
of
determination
and
boosts
self confidence
this
can
provide
a
significant
advantage
when
it
comes
to
problem solving
and
competing
against
one
s
own
goals
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
when
it
comes
to
meeting
new
people
getting
jobs
and
bringing
more
joy
into
life
having
a
positive
outlook
helps
to
put
people
at
ease
allowing
you
to
make
meaningful
connections
with
new
acquaintances
a
cheerful
attitude
also
helps
in
job
interviews
as
employers
are
more
likely
to
hire
those
who
demonstrate
positive
energy
and
enthusiasm
finally
a
positive
attitude
can
help
ward
off
feelings
of
depression
and
anxiety
and
can
make
life
feel
so
much
brighter
and
more
enjoyable
practicing
gratitude
and
recognizing
the
good
in
each
day
can
help
to
cultivate
a
positive
attitude
that
can
open
many
doors
and
bring
more
joy
into
life
getting
advice
is
an
important
part
of
navigating
life
s
decisions
but
sometimes
getting
the
best
advice
requires
talking
to
more
than
one
person
there
are
many
reasons
why
it
can
be
beneficial
to
talk
to
more
than
one
person
when
asking
for
advice
seeking
out
multiple
perspectives
allows
for
a
more
diverse
range
of
advice
talking
to
multiple
people
can
help
to
provide
an
array
of
different
ideas
and
solutions
that
one
person
may
have
overlooked
additionally
it
can
help
to
confirm
or
dispute
advice
given
if
multiple
people
independently
give
the
same
advice
when
asked
it
can
help
to
verify
its
credibility
lastly
talking
to
more
than
one
person
can
help
to
provide
comfort
and
reassurance
in
taking
on
difficult
decisions
when
multiple
sources
are
in
agreement
it
can
provide
more
assurance
that
the
advice
given
is
sound
in
conclusion
it
can
be
beneficial
to
talk
to
more
than
one
person
when
asking
for
advice
in

and
provide
reassurance
in
decision
making
my
three
favorite
outdoor
activities
are
running
hiking
and
biking
is
one
of
my
favorite
activities
because
it
helps
me
stay
fit
and
healthy
not
to
mention
it
s
a
great
way
to
explore
new
places
i
especially
enjoy
running
along
trails
as
i
get
to
admire
nature
up
close
is
another
activity
i
love
to
do
as
it
allows
me
to
get
up
close
and
personal
with
nature
not
to
mention
that
the
feeling
of
a
physical
challenge
is
energizing
also
provides
a
great
opportunity
to
practice
roaring
leaving
your
worries
and
stress
behind
and
focusing
on
the
here
and
now
last
but
not
least
biking
is
one
of
my
favorite
activities
as
it
combines
exercise
with
exploration
i
often
take
a
bike
ride
to
explore
new
areas
also
allows
me
to
ride
with
friends
making
the
experience
even
more
enjoyable
all
three
of
these
activities
are
rewarding
in
different
ways
and
that
is
why
they
are
my
favorite
outdoor
activities
starting
a
homework
club
in
schools
can
be
a
beneficial
experience
for
students
but
it
can
also
introduce
a
variety
of
challenges
and
emotions
advantages
of
organizing
a
homework
club
may
include
creating
a
space
for
students
to
catch
up
on
work
encouraging
academic
support
and
providing
a
platform
for
further
learning
opportunities
meanwhile
it
may
be
difficult
to
get
students
motivated
to
stay
after
school
and
it
could
create
added
pressure
due
to
expectations
set
by
parents
and
teachers
when
implementing
a
homework
club
it
is
important
to
remember
the
potential
feelings
and
emotions
of
students
and
consider
strategies
to
make
such
activities
engaging
and
inviting
additionally
it
is
important
to
remember
the
potential
challenges
that
may
arise
such
as
students
feeling
overwhelmed
by
academic
pressures
it
is
important
to
consider
all
factors
before
starting
a
homework
club
in
order
to
make
sure
that
it
is
an
effective
and
beneficial
experience
for
all
involved
as
any
writer
knows
it
s
important
to
have
a
checklist
when
preparing
to
write
to
begin
it
s
helpful
to
research
what
a
writing
checklist
entails
this
checklist
typically
includes
elements
such
as
identifying
the
audience
developing
a
thesis
statement
and
planning
out
the
structure
of
the
essay
or
writing
piece
it
s
essential
to
be
familiar
with
this
checklist
and
understand
why
it
s
so
important
to
utilize
it
in
the
writing
process
when
drafting
an
outline
take
note
of
the
key
arguments
of
why
using
a
writing
checklist
is
beneficial
consider
adding
supporting
details
of
how
the
checklist
helps
the
writer
with
organization
and
developing
a
clear
purpose
and
direction
for
the
piece
and
while
the
consensus
may
be
that
a
writing
checklist
is
beneficial
it
s
still
important
to
explore
different
opinions
and
perspectives
whether
some
writers
would
find
a
checklist
to
be
too
restrictive
or
even
unhelpful
in
the
writing
process
in
the
body
of
the
essay
discuss
both
sides
and
present
evidence
to
support
each
view
of
writing
with
and
without
a
checklist
consider
using
anecdotes
or
other
examples
to
illustrate
why
one
opinion
may
be
more
useful
than
the
other
this
can
ultimately
lead
to
a
resolution
or
compromise
on
the
use
of
a
checklist
in
the
writing
process
finally
draft
a
conclusion
highlighting
the
importance
of
utilizing
a
writing
checklist
this
summary
section
is
the
perfect
place
to
link
back
to
the
initial
points
made
about
the
checklist
and
suggest
that
ultimately
it
can
be
extremely
helpful
in
the
writing
process
for
those
who
utilize
it
when
it
comes
to
completing
a
task
people
may
have
various
preferences
on
whether
to
work
in
a
group
or
alone
working
in
a
group
can
have
many
advantages
work
can
be
shared
more
evenly
there
is
potential
for
more
innovative
ideas
and
it
can
be
a
more
social
and
enjoyable
task
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
can
also
have
its
own
advantages
such
as
allowing
one
to
focus
and
stay
focused
on
the
job
and
ensuring
that
all
the
responsibility
is
solely
on
the
individual
when
it
comes
to
workload
working
in
a
group
has
the
potential
to
be
more
efficient
due
to
sharing
workloads
and
having
several
minds
on
the
same
task
on
the
other
hand
when
working
alone
an
individual
will
have
to
carry
the
entire
workload
and
manage
their
own
time
and
motivations
in
terms
of
fun
working
in
a
group
has
greater
potential
for
being
enjoyable
and
entertaining
having
people
to
work
with
and
trade
ideas
off
of
can
be
seen
as
a
benefit
conversely
when
one
works
alone
there
is
a
greater
chance
for
boredom
and
disconnection
from
the
task
when
it
comes
to
ideas
working
in
a
group
allows
for
more
creative
freedom
due
to
the
helpful
insight
and
ideas
from
others
there
is
also
potential
to
build
off
of
one
another
s
ideas
with
having
all
the
responsibility
solely
resting
on
one
s
shoulders
when
working
alone
there
can
be
pressure
that
limits
creative
thinking
in
terms
of
focus
working
alone
can
be
important
as
it
allows
the
individual
to
settle
in
and
stay
on
task
without
potential
distractions
from
others
conversely
when
working
in
a
group
it
can
be
possible
for
one
s
focus
to
be
shifted
and
diluted
as
working
in
a
group
is
an
interactive
process
in
conclusion
there
are
clear
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
both
working
in
a
group
and
working
alone
whether
one
chooses
to
work
in
a
group
or
alone
ultimately
depends
upon
the
task
at
hand
and
the
individual
s
preferences
phones
have
become
invaluable
tools
especially
for
students
while
cell
phones
offer
many
advantages
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
using
them
in
the
classroom
for
educational
purposes
on
the
positive
side
cell
phones
can
be
used
to
help
students
keep
up
with
course
work
and
class
notes
not
only
do
they
provide
a
convenient
way
to
take
notes
but
they
can
also
be
used
to
access
educational
websites
virtual
classrooms
and
online
videos
and
articles
additionally
cell
phones
can
be
used
for
communication
purposes
such
as
group
collaboration
on
group
projects
or
critical
discussions
of
course
material
despite
the
potential
advantages
there
are
also
some
potential
drawbacks
to
using
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
for
instance
students
may
be
distracted
by
their
phones
leading
to
a
decrease
in
information
retention
and
overall
learning
additionally
if
cell
phones
aren
t
used
correctly
it
could
potentially
lead
to
decreased
grades
responding
to
emails
and
texting
in
the
classroom
must
be
monitored
to
ensure
cell
phone
use
will
be
productive
and
not
a
distraction
overall
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
should
not
be
discouraged
but
instead
should
be
used
with
caution
and
structure
when
used
correctly
cell
phones
offer
an
effective
tool
for
students
to
access
course
information
and
engage
in
meaningful
discussions
however
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
how
cell
phone
use
can
negatively
affect
student
grades
if
not
used
properly
the
idea
that
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
is
common
and
pervasive
in
our
society
it
is
often
believed
that
what
we
feel
and
think
upon
our
first
encounter
with
something
or
someone
will
often
remain
with
us
for
our
entire
relationship
with
them
and
that
changing
those
impressions
is
unlikely
or
impossible
has
confirmed
that
first
impressions
are
hard
to
shake
and
are
often
more
influential
than
we
think
in
one
study
participants
judged
actors
more
harshly
upon
reading
their
negative
reviews
than
they
did
reading
their
positive
reviews
this
indicates
that
even
if
something
or
someone
is
reconsidered
or
rehabilitated
people
can
still
be
heavily
influenced
by
their
initial
impressions
for
example
if
you
meet
someone
new
that
you
do
n t
immediately
like
it
can
be
difficult
to
shake
the
feeling
and
give
that
person
a
fair
chance
the
same
can
be
said
for
trying
new
food
shopping
for
clothing
visiting
a
place
for
the
first
time
and
any
other
number
of
situations
i
believe
this
statement
holds
a
lot
of
truth
when
we
are
presented
with
something
new
our
imaginations
often
draw
upon
snap
judgments
and
preconceived
ideas
to
make
sense
of
it
we
try
to
streamline
our
process
of
understanding
by
labeling
things
we
do
n t
know
with
identities
we
do
recognize
therefore
it
is
almost
impossible
to
change
that
first
impression
researching
the
various
activities
offered
at
the
school
is
a
great
way
to
gain
insight
into
one
s
own
interests
and
abilities
participating
in
something
that
sparks
one
s
curiosity
can
open
up
a
variety
of
new
opportunities
taking
part
in
extracurriculars
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
it
can
help
one
make
new
friends
gain
experience
necessary
for
a
college
degree
learn
things
that
are
outside
of
the
classroom
and
even
improve
their
future
getting
involved
in
a
school
activity
is
a
great
way
to
benefit
one
s
development
and
wellbeing
in
and
in
many
other
countries
there
is
debate
about
reducing
the
amount
of
time
required
for
high
school
completion
from
four
years
to
three
on
one
hand
proponents
cite
the
potential
for
students
to
enter
college
and
the
workforce
earlier
allowing
them
to
gain
valuable
experience
sooner
and
reap
the
related
benefits
parents
and
teachers
might
view
this
as
a
way
to
ensure
those
students
who
wish
to
move
onto
higher
education
or
a
career
have
the
ability
to
do
so
quickly
on
the
other
hand
such
a
change
may
create
an
environment
which
shortcuts
student
development
reducing
the
amount
of
important
life
skills
and
lessons
that
a
traditional
four
year
high
school
experience
provides
students
may
not
be
ready
to
handle
the
greater
responsibility
and
without
an
adequate
high
school
experience
may
find
themselves
unprepared
to
adjust
and
succeed
in
the
long
run
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
reducing
high
school
to
three
years
is
the
right
call
on
the
one
hand
it
may
be
beneficial
to
students
who
wish
to
move
onto
college
or
a
job
but
at
the
same
time
it
may
mean
they
don
t
have
the
skills
necessary
to
succeed
in
those
ventures
it
may
be
better
to
keep
high
school
as
is
a
four
year
process
that
allows
individuals
to
gain
and
hone
the
skills
and
knowledge
they
need
in
order
to
move
onto
the
next
level
of
their
lives
in
s
famous
quote
he
suggests
that
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
on
it
nonstop
while
the
sentiment
of
hard
work
can
be
motivating
it
s
important
to
consider
the
purpose
of
inactivity
and
its
benefits
taking
breaks
is
essential
for
our
physical
and
mental
health
as
it
can
help
reduce
stress
clear
our
minds
and
foster
creative
thinking
it
is
equally
as
important
to
recognize
the
potential
pitfalls
of
being
inactive
without
breaks
people
are
more
at
risk
for
fatigue
burnout
and
decreased
productivity
when
it
comes
to
working
hard
or
taking
a
break
there
is
no
universal
answer
each
person
must
examine
the
best
approach
for
their
specific
situation
while
it
is
possible
to
accomplish
more
if
you
are
working
all
the
time
it
can
also
be
beneficial
to
take
breaks
in
order
to
rejuvenate
and
recharge
has
the
potential
to
serve
a
purpose
it
can
help
restore
energy
levels
improve
focus
and
increase
productivity
ultimately
inactivity
serves
as
a
reminder
that
rest
and
relaxation
are
just
as
essential
as
hard
work
for
achieving
success
in
order
to
make
sure
i
achieve
my
dreams
i
need
to
be
determined
and
resilient
i
need
to
work
hard
ask
for
help
from
trusted
adults
if
i
m
in
need
and
develop
enthusiasm
towards
what
i
m
trying
to
accomplish
i
should
stay
away
from
bad
influences
and
remember
that
anything
is
possible
as
long
as
i
put
in
the
effort
even
if
i
fail
multiple
times
i
must
n t
give
up
and
should
instead
come
up
with
a
new
plan
and
keep
on
trying
i
m
sure
i
can
reach
my
goals
and
fulfill
my

if
i
keep

in

curfews
are
an
important
tool
in
helping
teenagers
develop
responsibility
and
self regulation
by
setting
a
curfew
for
teens
parents
can
ensure
their
child
s
safety
help
foster
better
relationships
and
give
them
a
healthy
lifestyle
one
of
the
primary
benefits
of
implementing
a
curfew
is
that
it
increases
safety
with
a
curfew
in
place
teens
are
discouraged
from
participating
in
risky
activities
such
as
taking
part
in
criminal
activities
or
driving
with
no
license
additionally
parents
can
be
sure
that
their
teens
are
in
a
safe
place
and
not
in
an
environment
where
they
are
vulnerable
to
potential
harm
another
benefit
of
curfews
for
teenagers
is
that
it
can
help
build
better
relationships
with
their
family
by
enforcing
a
curfew
teens
are
given
structure
and
their
parents
can
be
reassured
that
their
children
are
safe
this
can
encourage
communication
and
dialogue
between
families
and
help
foster
a
strong
bond
between
parents
and
their
children
curfews
can
help
provide
teens
with
the
structure
and
guidance
they
need
to
stay
safe
and
healthy
it
can
help
give
parents
peace
of
mind
and
keep
teens
away
from

all
that
has
to
offer
the
effects
of
technology
on
society
have
been
seen
both
positively
and
negatively
in
the
present
technology
has
allowed
people
to
connect
across
physical
boundaries
in
ways
that
were
previously
impossible
social
movements
including
those
focused
on
education
reform
and
civil
rights
have
been
effectively
organized
through
technology
however
people
s
heavy
reliance
on
technology
can
also
have
serious
consequences
face to face
interaction
is
becoming
increasingly
rare
as
people
spend
more
time
interacting
with
screens
than
with
each
other
this
has
been
linked
to
aggressive
behavior
when
people
are
told
to
limit
their
use
of
technology
as
well
as
a
general
lack
of
social
awareness
and
inability
to
interpret
body
language
in
the
past
technology
had
limited
importance
in
society
people
were
largely
disconnected
and
isolated
from
one
another
hampered
by
the
slow
speed
of
communication
and
resulting
misunderstanding
of
different
cultures
as
technology
has
advanced
it
has
given
people
the
capability
to
exchange
ideas
and
collaborate
in
ways
that
were
not
previously
possible
to
counterbalance
the
potential
issues
caused
by
technology
people
should
prioritize
face to face
interaction
foster
empathy
during
conversations
and
be
mindful
of
their
own
technology
use
it
is
important
to
understand
that
technology
is
only
one
tool
that
facilitates
relationships
it
should
never
replace
human
interaction
working
alone
often
has
a
number
of
advantages
over
working
in
groups
for
starters
it
can
be
more
efficient
since
you
only
have
to
consider
your
own
needs
and
preferences
you
wo
n t
have
to
waste
time
trying
to
work
out
group
dynamics
or
compromise
on
decisions
additionally
it
can
be
beneficial
for
students
to
work
independently
working
alone
offers
them
the
opportunity
to
learn
to
think
critically
and
come
up
with
their
own
solutions
it
also
instills
a
sense
of
autonomy
and
responsibility
as
there
are
no
other
people
to
depend
on
to
complete
tasks
when
faced
with
a
challenging
problem
the
individual
is
better
equipped
to
simply
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
rather
than
trying
to
coordinate
a
group
i
believe
that
it
is
often
better
for
students
to
work
alone
than
in
a
group
and
efficiency
are
both
major
benefits
that
can
help
to
foster
an
environment
of
intellectual
inquiry
and
personal
growth
education
is
a
critical
element
of
any
high
school
student
s
future
and
the
importance
of
this
education
can
not
be
overstated
unfortunately
it
is
not
uncommon
for
some
students
to
begin
to
identify
their
future
career
paths
before
completing
their
high
school
education
this
premature
commitment
to
one
career
can
have
major
implications
on
a
student
s
school
work
mental
health
and
physical
health
one
of
the
most
significant
potential
problems
with
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
is
that
students
may
be
unprepared
or
undereducated
for
their
chosen
profession
without
the
necessary
education
or
tools
students
may
be
unable
to
succeed
in
their
chosen
careers
leading
to
feelings
of
frustration
and
diminished
self worth
additionally
a
premature
commitment
to
a
career
can
lead
to
unrealistic
expectations
burn
out
and
a
lack
of
motivation
it
is
important
to
provide
students
with
the
necessary
guidance
and
support
to
ensure
they
have
the
best
chance
for
success
in
their
future
endeavors
encouraging
students
to
take
their
time
to
explore
and
research
various
career
paths
can
have
positive
impacts
on
their
mental
and
physical
health
as
well
as
their
school
work
providing
students
with
the
tools
and
resources
to
develop
an
individualized
plan
for
their
future
career
can
help
to
ensure
that
they
have
the
best
possible
chance
of
achieving
success
i
ve
come
to
understand
that
the
actions
and
behaviors
that
i
exhibit
can
have
a
strong
influence
on
those
around
me
with
this
understanding
i
have
become
more
mindful
of
the
examples
i
m
setting
for
those
in
my
life
i
strive
to
demonstrate
respect
openness
patience
and
acceptance
towards
others
and
to
be
honest
and
considerate
in
my
words
and
actions
by
doing
so
i
strive
to
set
a
good
example
of
how
one
should
interact
with
the
world
having
a
good
attitude
is
incredible
beneficial
it
can
help
you
become
successful
in
life
make
relationships
stronger
make
work
tasks
easier
and
have
a
general
feeling
of
wellbeing
it
can
also
help
you
stay
ahead
in
difficult
times
strategies
for
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
during
these
times
include
manifesting
positive
thoughts
writing
out
your
feelings
in
a
journal
devising
a
plan
to
tackle
the
challenge
head
on
being
grateful
for
the
good
things
in
life
and
turning
your
negative
thoughts
into
something
positive
being
positive
can
be
even
more
important
during
challenging
times
as
it
can
give
you
the
inner
strength
and
belief
to
do
really
great
things
smiling
is
such
a
simple
thing
but
it
can
make
such
a
huge
difference
smiling
can
make
other
people
around
you
happier
too
and
it
can
also
help
boost
your
own
mood
people
who
achieve
success
often
credit
their
positive
attitude
in
helping
them
to
succeed
and
it
can
be
inspiring
to
research
some
historical
and
modern day
examples
of
how
having
a
good
attitude
can
be
a
key
factor
in
reaching
success
remaining
true
to
yourself
is
also
important
even
though
being
positive
is
important
your
own
beliefs
feelings
and
opinions
should
n t
be
sacrificed
to
stay
upbeat
working
in
a
group
has
been
proven
to
be
an
efficient
way
of
tackling
tasks
this
is
because
when
working
in
a
group
people
can
quickly
build
on
ideas
use
group
synergies
and
leverage
the
resources
of
every
individual
furthermore
it
can
help
to
promote
creative
and
innovative
solutions
to
problems
as
group
members
come
with
different
perspectives
and
backgrounds
that
can
help
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
task
at
hand
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
drawbacks
to
working
in
groups
projects
require
more
management
and
can
be
difficult
to
manage
when
there
is
a
lack
of
direction
group
dynamics
can
be
complicated
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
gather
everyone
on
the
same
page
additionally
the
group
approach
does
not
always
work
for
everyone
as
some
individuals
work
better
when
working
by
themselves
to
illustrate
the
pros
and
cons
of
working
within
a
group
and
as
an
individual
consider
the
example
of
a
software
development
project
working
in
a
group
can
be
advantageous
in
this
instance
as
collaborating
on
a
project
can
promote
faster
progress
since
everyone
can
quickly
build
on
ideas
and
work
off
each
other
on
the
other
hand
some
people
might
prefer
to
work
alone
because
they
might
feel
more
comfortable
dominating
the
task
and
have
more
control
over
the
overall
outcome
in
conclusion
while
there
are
clear
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
both
working
in
a
group
and
working
alone
it
truly
depends
on
the
task
and
the
individual
s
preference
as
to
which
approach
will
be
more
effective
phone
use
in
the
classroom
has
been
a
widely
debated
topic
in
recent
years
with
many
schools
implementing
rules
and
regulations
to
govern
their
use
my
opinion
is
that
cell
phones
should
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
as
long
as
they
are
used
responsibly
and
with
the
proper
guidelines
in
place
phones
can
be
a
great
way
to
access
resources
both
inside
and
outside
the
classroom
students
can
use
their
phones
to
look
up
relevant
information
that
can
be
used
in
class
discussions
they
can
also
take
pictures
or
videos
of
their
notes
which
allows
them
to
study
more
effectively
at
home
or
while
on
break
additionally
phones
can
serve
as
a
tool
to
stay
organized
reminders
to do
lists
and
alarms
can
help
students
keep
on
track
and
stay
on
task
furthermore
allowing
cell
phone
usage
can
help
foster
relationships
between
students
and
teachers
by
having
access
to
their
phones
students
can
contact
their
teachers
with
questions
or
for
further
help
this
would
lead
to
more
meaningful
collaborations
and
discussions
between
the
two
parties
leading
to
a
greater
understanding
of
the
material
being
taught
in
conclusion
allowing
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
is
a
reasonable
decision
it
can
open
up
more
possibilities
in
terms
of
learning
organization
and
communication
between
students
and
teachers
of
course
guidelines
need
to
be
in
place
in
order
to
ensure
that
cell
phones
are
used
responsibly
and
follow
school
policies
nonetheless
the
advantages
of
having
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
far
outweigh
any
potential
detriment
in
our
increasingly
impersonal
world
the
power
of
small
acts
of
kindness
can
often
be
forgotten
a
single
smile
a
pat
on
the
back
and
a
few
kind
words
can
have
a
big
impact
on
the
lives
of
those
around
us
from
family
members
and
friends
to
colleagues
and
complete
strangers
we
can
make
a
difference
in
the
lives
of
others
through
small
acts
of
kindness
small
acts
of
kindness
can
help
to
reinforce
positive
connections
between
people
for
example
when
walking
down
the
street
hold
the
door
for
the
person
behind
you
or
say
good
morning
with
a
smile
such
simple
gestures
can
go
a
long
way
in
helping
to
strengthen
a
bond
between
two
individuals
or
even
within
a
whole
community
no
matter
how
small
paying
it
forward
can
brighten
someone
s
day
showing
appreciation
for
someone
s
hard
work
or
providing
words
of
encouragement
can
leave
them
feeling
good
one
person
s
positive
reaction
to
a
small
act
of
kindness
can
help
to
spread
joy
to
other
people
in
their
lives
and
even
around
the
world
therefore
it
is
clear
that
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
a
big
impact
on
others
by
remembering
to
take
even
the
smallest
opportunities
to
offer
kindness
and
compassion
we
can
create
a
happier
more
connected
society
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
achieving
success

can
help
an
individual

builds
self confidence

positive
attitude

feel
empowered
to
take
on
new
tasks
or
challenges
they
previously
avoided
fosters
quality
relationships
a
positive
attitude
helps
to
foster
quality
relationships
with
peers
and
mentors
for
example
an
individual
with
a
positive
attitude
may
be
more
open
to
receiving
feedback
on
their
work
and
in
turn
be
able
to
develop
and
maintain
strong
relationships
with
those
they
interact
with
encourages
persistence
having
a
positive
attitude
towards
obstacles
and
challenges
encourages
individuals
to
persist
and
not
give
up
even
when
the
going
gets
tough
for
example
an
individual
with
a
positive
attitude
may
be
more
likely
to
seek
out
solutions
and
resources
to
help
them
push
through
difficult
times

a
positive
attitude
is
an
important
factor

good
it

has
resonated
with

may
find
that
their
art
studies
become
crucial
in

experience
to

a
critical
element
of
providing
a
well rounded
education
and
ensuring
students
have
the
best
opportunity
for
success
healthy
meals
provide
the
fuel
students
need
to
stay
energized
and
focused
as
they
progress
through
the
school
day
not
only
are
healthy
meals
important
for
physical
health
but
research
has
shown
that
they
also
contribute
to
improved
academic
performance
eating
a
balanced
diet
including
foods
such
as
healthy
proteins
fruits
and
vegetables
and
whole
grains
can
help
improve
students
cognitive
abilities
sharpen
their
memories
and
give
them
the
physical
and
mental
energy
needed
for
learning
additionally
healthy
meals
can
even
help
combat
absenteeism
which
can
result
in
students
falling
behind
in
their
classes
ultimately
providing
students
with
healthy
meals
during
school
is
an
essential
part
of
providing
a
quality
education
by
ensuring
students
have
nourishing
meals
we
can
not
only
help
them
stay
energized
and
focused
but
also
help
them
reach
their
full
academic
potential
distance
learning
has
been
rapidly
growing
in
popularity
due
to
its
many
advantages
such
as
having
classes
available
from
the
comfort
of
one
s
own
home
it
can
also
be
very
convenient
for
students
with
busy
schedules
or
those
who
must
travel
as
learning
is
no
longer
affected
by
physical
location
additionally
students
can
make
use
of
resources
such
as
audio
and
video
recordings
to
go
back
and
review
the
material
if
needed
however
distance
learning
also
has
some
disadvantages
one
potential
concern
is
student
motivation
and
engagement
with
learning
material
without
physical
contact
to
the
teacher
and
fellow
students
some
students
may
feel
less
motivated
or
connected
to
their
studies
there
can
be
difficulties
with
the
technology
and
possible
miscommunication
between
students
and
teachers
as
well
finally
online
classes
can
also
limit
students
access
to
materials
or
resources
that
can
only
be
found
in
a
physical
classroom
when
it
comes
to
first
impressions
it
can
be
difficult
to
change
them
once
they
are
made
we
often
make
snap
judgments
of
people
and
situations
based
on
our
initial
instincts
especially
if
they
present
a
negative
view
that
said
some
have
argued
that
it
is
indeed
possible
to
change
a
negative
first
impression
through
sincere
effort
and
dialogue
proponents
of
this
idea
point
to
the
value
of
communication
and
the
power
of
trust
they
suggest
that
by
having
honest
conversations
and
demonstrating
genuine
care
a
negative
impression
can
be
overturned
they
claim
that
other
factors
such
as
body
language
and
facial
expressions
can
also
help
show
someone
that
has
been
judged
too
harshly
on
the
other
hand
some
opponents
argue
that
such
an
endeavor
is
ultimately
fruitless
as
our
first
instincts
are
difficult
to
shake
they
claim
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
rewrite
someone
s
opinion
when
a
negative
impression
has
been
made
they
argue
that
it
is
better
to
make
a
positive
impression
from
the
start
in
order
to
avoid
any
potential
damage
both
sides
of
this
argument
offer
valid
points
and
the
reality
is
likely
somewhere
in
the
middle
while
it
is
likely
not
easy
to
change
a
negative
first
impression
it
is
likely
not
impossible
either
the
importance
of
communication
trust
and
demonstrating
genuine
care
are
key
in
any
successful
relationship
and
it
is
possible
to
turn
a
negative
first
impression
around
if
both
parties
are
willing
to
be
open
and
honest
online
classes
have
been
gaining
in
popularity
among
high
school
students
taking
online
classes
from
home
can
provide
students
with
numerous
advantages
they
can
study
in
their
own
time
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
and
can
have
more
control
over
the
speed
at
which
they
complete
their
courses
this
increases
flexibility
and
allows
students
to
pursue
other
activities
with
the
extra
time
saved
such
as
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
or
setting
aside
more
time
for
leisure
at
the
same
time
there
are
drawbacks
to
taking
online
classes
students
may
have
limited
access
to
tutors
and
course
support
they
may
also
miss
out
on
the
social
and
collaborative
learning
opportunities
that
traditional
classrooms
provide
students
may
lack
the
motivation
and
self discipline
to
successfully
complete
an
online
course
for
example
a
student
may
take
an
online
math
course
that
allows
them
to
complete
courses
in
their
own
time
this
allows
them
to
schedule
additional
time
for
extracurricular
activities
or
leisure
such
as
joining
a
local
sports
team
or
exploring
new
hobbies
however
they
may
also
be
at
risk
of
failing
the
course
if
they
lack
the
necessary
discipline
and
self motivation
in
life threatening
situations
it
is
important
to
stay
as
safe
as
possible
to
help
with
this
here
are
some
tips
for
five
high
school
grade
students
when
faced
with
an
intruder
in
a
lockdown
situation
students
should
look
for
objects
to
throw
that
are
heavier
than
their
textbooks
this
can
include
heavy
lamps
or
furniture
when
faced
with
a
fire
drill
students
should
quickly
gather
any
valuables
or
necessary
items
then
proceed
calmly
and
quickly
to
the
nearest
exit
when
an
earthquake
hits
students
should
stay
low
to
the
ground
and
move
away
from
any
heavy
furniture
or
objects
that
could
fall
additionally
if
students
are
in
a
building
it
is
important
for
them
to
cover
their
head
and
neck
with
their
hand
or
a
jacket
until
the
shaking
stops
no
matter
what
situation
students
find
themselves
in
it
s
important
to
stay
calm
and
always
follow
emergency
procedures
throughout
this
essay
i
will
explore
the
importance
of
trusting
people
experiences
where
my
trust
has
been
broken
and
how
to
identify
bad
influences
when
i
was
younger
i
made
a
mistake
of
accepting
a
bad
friendship
with
someone
who
pushed
me
to
make
decisions
i
was
uncomfortable
with
despite
their
bad
influence
i
trusted
them
and
allowed
myself
to
be
controlled
for
fear
of
losing
them
i
soon
learned
that
this
person
had
lied
to
me
and
was
not
the
friend
i
thought
they
were
i
lost
more
than
just
a
friend
but
my
trust
and
faith
in
someone
else
this
experience
made
me
realize
the
importance
of
being
able
to
trust
other
people
and
not
succumb
to
changing
just
because
it
s
difficult
to
stay
firm
about
who
you
are
it
s
essential
to
determine
if
a
person
is
a
good
influence
or
a
bad
influence
this
can
be
done
by
assessing
how
someone
makes
you
feel
what
kind
of
advice
they
give
you
and
how
they
react
when
you
refuse
to
do
something
they
ask
you
to
do
good
influences
are
encouraging
supportive
and
understand
when
you
make
the
decision
to
be
true
to
yourself
on
the
other
hand
bad
influences
are
often
manipulative
disloyal
and
quick
to
be
dishonest
when
things
do
n t
go
their
way
i
learned
the
importance
of
trusting
people
but
also
verifying
if
they
will
be
a
positive
or
negative
presence
in
your
life
it
s
not
wrong
to
be
kind
and
have
faith
in
those
around
you
but
it
s
also
important
to
know
your
limits
pay
attention
to
the
red
flags
and
be
confident
in
your
decisions
and
beliefs
had
always
been
an
independent
learner
who
rarely
consulted
others
for
advice
so
when
faced
with
a
big
decision
like
deciding
on
a
college
typically
hopped
online
performed
their
own
research
and
then
made
a
decision
without
ever
seeking
the
counsel
of
anyone
else
however
this
often
lead
to
decisions
that
weren
t
the
best
for
in
the
long
run
when
moved
to
a
new
city
there
were
a
lot
of
considerations
that
one
person
alone
couldn
t
have
anticipated
began
to
recognize
the
value
of
seeking
multiple
opinions
in
order
to
make
better
decisions
that
would
bring
lasting
success
one
of
the
primary
benefits
of
seeking
multiple
opinions
is
being
able
to
receive
different
perspectives
from
other
people
external
advice
can
provide
guidance
that
was
not
previously
considered
people
with
different
experiences
often
offer
solutions
that
couldn
t
have
been
achieved
by
an
individual
for
instance
when
decided
to
start
a
business
they
were
able
to
get
advice
from
an
individual
who
had
successfully
started
their
own
business
ten
years
prior
this
person
shared
their
insights
and
experiences
on
the
best
business
model
to
use
and
it
ultimately
saved
a
great
deal
of
time
and
money
for
seeking
multiple
opinions
also
gives
one
more
than
one
option
to
choose
from
instead
of
blindly
accepting
a
single
option
found
more
solutions
when
they
decided
to
turn
to
their
family
and
friends
when
was
deciding
on
a
major
in
college
they
received
advice
from
their
parents
siblings
and
classmates
this
resulted
in
having
more
options
to
evaluate
and
make
an
informed
decision
about
the
major
that
was
best
for
their
future
additionally
seeking
multiple
opinions
can
help
you
solve
problems
that
seemed
unsolvable
when
wanted
to
find
a
new
job
they
started
to
ask
colleagues
and
peers
for
leverage
and
advice
this
resulted
in
being
able
to
network
in
greater
depth
and
ultimately
uncover
a
better
job
opportunity
than
initially
expected
in
conclusion
seeking
multiple
opinions
can
help
someone
make
better
choices
it
provides
people
with
more
than
one
option
and
exposes
them
to
different
perspectives
moreover
it
can
help
you
solve
problems
that
seemed
unsolvable
found
all
of
this
to
be
true
through
personal
experience
as
such
they
decided
to
be
more
open minded
and
consult
those
around
them
before
making
decisions
that
will
have
a
high
impact
on
their
life
one
of
the
greatest
educational
benefits
of
taking
an
art
music
or
drama
class
as
an
elective
in
school
is
the
development
of
creativity
by
engaging
in
creative
activities
such
as
painting
writing
music
or
performing
on
stage
students
acquire
skills
that
go
beyond
the
traditional
academic
curriculum
and
can
help
them
become
more
creative
thinkers
additionally
taking
art
music
and
drama
classes
can
help
improve
a
student
s
academic
performance
as
research
has
shown
that
students
who
participate
in
creative
activities
tend
to
score
higher
on
tests
think
more
critically
and
have
better
problem
solving
skills
in
addition
to
academic
performance
taking
art
music
and
drama
classes
can
provide
students
with
practical
skills
and
knowledge
that
are
beneficial
for
college
and
career
prospects
learned
in
these
classes
such
as
how
to
read
and
interpret
music
create
and
understand
art
and
perform
and
interpret
a
dramatic
script
can
be
useful
for
college
and
job
applications
furthermore
collaborative
activities
such
as
ensemble
performance
and
group
theatres
can
help
students
gain
important
interpersonal
skills
such
as
teamwork
and
leadership
that
are
beneficial
for
college
and
professional
endeavors
by
taking
art
music
and
drama
classes
students
can
gain
an
in depth
understanding
of
the
various
aspects
of
these
creative
pursuits
this
knowledge
can
be
applied
to
various
aspects
of
their
lives
such
as
studying
developing
creativity
and
providing
them
with
the
opportunity
to
pursue
their
interests
in
a
safe
structured
environment
therefore
a
persuasive
essay
about
why
students
should
take
art
music
and
drama
classes
could
include
the
following
points
the
development
of
creativity
the
potential
for
improved
academic
performance
the
gain
of
practical
skills
and
knowledge
and
the
opportunity
to
explore
various
creative
pursuits
in
a
safe
and
structured
environment
in
today
s
modern
world
technology
is
an
integral
part
of
everyone
s
lives
from
the
social
media
platforms
that
people
use
to
stay
connected
with
others
to
the
devices
that
allow
us
to
work
from
anywhere
in
the
world
technology
has
undeniably
reshaped
the
way
that
people
communicate
unfortunately
this
has
led
to
the
limitation
of
physical
human
contact
which
has
had
numerous
negative
impacts
on
people
s
health
recent
studies
have
found
that
people
who
spend
less
time
engaging
in
face to face
social
interactions
are
more
likely
to
suffer
from
depression
anxiety
and
feelings
of
loneliness
but
why
is
that
put
it
s
because
physical
interaction
is
necessary
for
human
connection
without
it
people
do
not
get
the
validation
and
emotional
support
that
they
need
in
order
to
lead
healthy
and
fulfilling
lives
furthermore
people
have
become
dependent
on
technology
as
a
crutch
they
utilize
it
as
a
way
to
feel
connected
with
others
even
when
they
do
n t
have
any
real
human
contact
this
disrupts
the
natural
cycle
of
social
interactions
and
disconnects
people
from
reality
making
it
difficult
for
them
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
others
my
own
personal
experience
has
demonstrated
the
importance
of
human
contact
in
maintaining
one
s
mental
and
physical
well being
when
i
was
stuck
at
home
last
year
due
to
the
pandemic
virtually
every
interaction
i
had
was
through
a
laptop
or
phone
screen
and
i
really
started
to
feel
the
negative
effects
of
it
i
found
myself
anxious
and
overwhelmed
and
i
often
felt
lonely
and
isolated
it
was
only
when
i
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
meet
with
a
few
friends
in person
that
i
was
able
to
gain
back
my
sense
of
control
and
calm
my
frazzled
nerves
and
while
the
use
of
technology
will
always
be
necessary
in
our
lives
we
must
remember
to
prioritize
real
human
interaction
as
an
essential
component
of
our
health
and
well being
as
an
artist
famously
said
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
this
resonates
with
me
as
i
can
think
of
multiple
times
in
my
life
where
i
have
set
my
goals
too
low
and
have
forgotten
to
reach
for
the
stars
as
it
were
for
example
when
i
was
on
my
high
school
s
soccer
team
i
was
content
to
be
a
middle of the pack
player
when
i
had
the
potential
to
be
one
of
the
best
players
similarly
while
looking
for
a
job
after
college
i
was
all
too
happy
to
take
the
first
offer
that
came
my
way
rather
than
researching
other
opportunities
that
could
have
made
for
a
challenging
yet
rewarding
career
as
time
passed
and
i
set
my
goals
higher
i
began
to
see
the
positive
repercussions
of
this
decision
on
the
soccer
team
i
pushed
myself
to
excel
on
the
field
eventually
becoming
team
captain
in
my
senior
season
in
the
professional
world
i
chose
to
take
the
time
and
actively
explore
new
opportunities
that
have
let
me
grow
as
an
individual
and
be
successful
as
a
professional
both
of
these
present
a
clear
link
between
s
words
and
my
own
experiences
with
any
effort
we
put
forth
in
life
we
must
challenge
ourselves
to
set
goals
that
will
push
our
limits
and
boundaries
so
that
we
can
reach
our
maximum
potential
as
seen
in
my
own
life
s
words
serve
as
a
reminder
that
setting
our
sights
too
low
is
a
greater
danger
than
failing
to
reach
an
ambitious
goal
to
quote
the
artist
himself
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
by
seeking
to
challenge
one
s
self
and
remaining
ambitious
a
person
can
submit
themselves
to
a
path
that
may
be
difficult
but
will
ultimately
lead
to
success
in
the
long
run
once
famously
stated
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
s
words
provide
a
great
reminder
of
the
importance
of
failure
in
achieving
success
failure
is
essential
to
success
because
it
helps
us
to
develop
skills
to
learn
resilience
and
to
become
better
problem solvers
take
for
example
s
lightbulb
famously
said
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
won
t
work
after
thousands
of
trials
and
errors
eventually
achieved
success
had
he
given
up
at
the
first
few
attempts
of
failure
he
would
have
never
created
the
lightbulb
one
of
the
most
significant
scientific
discoveries
of
the
late
century
similarly
the
film
industry
is
filled
with
stories
of
those
who
found
success
after
a
history
of
failure
was
turned
down
by
the
of
s
film
school
three
times
and
was
rejected
from
numerous
times
before
making
his
first
feature length
film
these
examples
demonstrate
that
s
statement
holds
true
it
is
only
through
the
courage
to
continue
even
in
the
face
of
failure
that
success
can
be
achieved
when
it
comes
to
deceptive
behaviors
one
example
is
when
someone
changes
their
appearance
or
behavior
in
order
to
impress
or
get
something
from
someone
else
for
example
if
a
person
is
trying
to
get
a
job
they
may
dress
more
professionally
than
their
usual
style
in
order
to
leave
a
better
first
impression
on
their
potential
employer
additionally
when
individuals
feel
left
out
of
a
group
their
behavior
can
change
drastically
in
order
to
impress
or
be
accepted
by
the
group
and
it
can
be
evident
through
their
tone
body
language
or
even
words
used
first
impressions
may
give
you
a
good
indication
of
a
person
s
trustworthiness
and
ability
when
observing
someone
for
the
first
time
the
nonverbal
behavior
such
as
facial
expressions
and
physical
movements
can
be
a
good
indication
of
a
person
s
true
intentions
overall
it
is
important
to
take
into
consideration
these
deceptive
behaviors
as
they
can
potentially
give
away
hints
as
to
what
a
person
may
be
trying
to
accomplish
art
music
and
drama
classes
are
commonly
offered
in
schools
but
some
people
debate
whether
they
should
be
electives
or
required
for
students
of
all
ages
while
these
classes
have
the
potential
to
spark
creativity
in
some
students
forcing
students
to
take
them
can
have
unpleasant
and
even
detrimental
results
forcing
students
to
take
classes
in
the
arts
can
be
a
challenging
burden
for
those
who
struggle
with
creative
expression
or
don
t
have
an
interest
in
them
for
instance
some
students
may
become
easily
overwhelmed
in
an
art
class
as
they
try
to
master
the
mechanics
of
painting
drawing
or
sculpting
similarly
music
classes
may
feel
intimidating
if
students
feel
like
they
are
constantly
being
judged
on
their
performance
and
can
t
seem
to
get
the
rhythm
or
notes
right
as
for
drama
classes
the
pressure
of
improvisation
or
memorizing
lines
in
front
of
an
audience
can
cause
some
students
to
dread
the
class
allowing
students
to
pick
their
own
classes
in
the
makes
more
sense
that
way
those
with
an
interest
or
aptitude
for
a
particular
class
can
pursue
it
while
those
who
don
t
have
any
inclination
for
the
subject
can
find
classes
more
suited
to
their
interests
for
example
if
a
student
loves
taking
pictures
they
may
be
more
inclined
to
take
a
photography
class
than
a
painting
class
ultimately
mandating
art
music
and
drama
classes
can
be
difficult
for
some
students
and
impractical
for
many
for
this
reason
it
s
important
to
allow
students
to
choose
their
classes
so
they
can
pursue
subjects
and
activities
they
find
enjoyable
and
engaging
doing
so
is
beneficial
for
the
students
and
the
school
in
the
long run
as
it
increases
the
likelihood
of
students
succeeding
in
their
chosen
electives
while
also
giving
the
school
a
better
indication
of
student
interests
in
life

important
to
maintain
our

to
stay
motivated
and
focused
on
our
goals
however
understanding
that
perseverance
is
key
to
overcoming
adversity
can
provide
us
with
strength
and
a
sense
of
purpose
when
we
accept
that
setbacks
are
a
part
of
life
we
can
use
them
to
our
advantage
and
learn
from
our
experiences
we
must
remember
that
our
values
are
not
determined
by
external
factors
but
rather
by
the
decisions
we
make
on
our
own

responsibility
for
our

goals
and
values
is
necessary
for
personal
growth
and
success

can
be
easy
to
become
discouraged
when
we
face
an
obstacle
but
understanding
that
setbacks
are
often
a
part
of

make
great
progress

to
ourselves

continuing
to
strive
despite
the
challenges
we
have
faced
we
can
find
the
strength
and
motivation
to
achieve
our
goals
showing
resilience
in
the
face
of
setbacks
is
an
essential
part
of
our
growth
and
we
must
remain
grounded
in
our
values
and
goals
to
succeed
despite
the
obstacles
and
challenges
we
face
perseverance
and
staying
true
to
ourselves
is
invaluable
in
finding
our
greatest
potential
determine
never
to
be
idle
is
a
quote
attributed
to
and
it
is
a
valuable
saying
that
resonates
with
today
s
society
where
it
often
feels
like
there
is
not
enough
time
in
the
day
for
all
we
need
to
do
how
can
we
as
a
society
apply
this
quote
and
reduce
our
collective
idleness
by
committing
ourselves
to
utilizing
every
moment
to
the
best
of
our
abilities
we
can
ensure
that
our
time
and
energy
are
being
used
in
an
effective
and
productive
way
for
instance
one
individual
who
was
determined
not
to
be
idle
was
who
dropped
out
of
but
still
managed
to
create
one
of
the
most
successful
and
recognizable
technology
companies
in
history
instead
of
wasting
his
time
being
idle
gates
used
his
ambition
and
determination
to
create
something
meaningful
with
his
time
and
today
his
success
serves
as
an
example
for
others
those
who
are
idle
and
think
that
inactivity
serves
a
purpose
are
not
only
not
determined
to
better
their
lives
but
they
are
also
not
planning
for
the
future
this
means
that
a
lack
of
passion
can
lead
to
stunted
intellectual
growth
and
missed
opportunities
by
actively
pushing
ourselves
to
use
our
time
and
resources
to
their
fullest
potential
we
can
boost
our
creativity

and
futures

this
service

a
policy
allowing
students
to
use
their
cellphones
during
lunch
and
free
time
has
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
on
the
positive
side
it
can
be
an
effective
way
to
help
students
stay
connected
to
family
and
friends
especially
for
those
who
live
far
away
or
do
n t
have
access
to
other
forms
of
communication
additionally
it
can
be
a
great
tool
for
students
to
access
educational
resources
such
as
audio
podcasts
news
articles
and
educational
videos
during
lunch
or
other
free
time
on
the
negative
side
being
able
to
access
social
media
or
play
games
during
lunch
can
be
a
distraction
from
the
purpose
of
taking
a
break
from
the
school
day
additionally
unstructured
access
to
technology
can
led
to
an
increase
in
cyberbullying
or
unwise
internet
use
it
is
important
for
schools
to
set
rules
around
the
use
of
cellphones
and
have
a
strict
policy
of
consequences
for
inappropriate
behavior
making
music
drama
and
art
classes
compulsory
for
students
can
offer
many
advantages
it
is
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
learn
to
express
themselves
explore
their
creativity
and
develop
the
ability
to
think
critically
and
artistically
learning
music
drama
and
art
can
also
help
students
better
understand
different
cultures
and
viewpoints
and
add
to
their
overall
educational
experience
on
the
other
hand
some
students
may
not
have
an
interest
in
these
subjects
and
making
them
compulsory
may
make
them
feel
unmotivated
and
annoyed
additionally
if
these
classes
are
not
taught
in
an
engaging
manner
students
may
not
be
able
to
gain
any
meaningful
knowledge
from
them
overall
i
believe
that
music
drama
and
art
classes
should
be
included
as
part
of
the
curriculum
but
not
made
compulsory
if
students
have
a
genuine
interest
in
these
subjects
they
should
be
encouraged
to
pursue
them
further
this
would
help
them
get
the
most
out
of
the
classes
and
keep
them
engaged
while
those
who
would
prefer
to
avoid
them
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
extracurricular

a
valuable
way
for
school
students
to
learn
beyond
the
classroom
and
get
more
out
of
their

these
methods
can
be

activities
offer
a
unique
opportunity
to
get
away
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
everyday
life
being
able
to
enjoy
fresh
air
and
the
natural
beauty
of
the
world
that
surrounds
us
can
bring
about
a
sense
of
joy
and
peace
that
is
difficult
to
find
elsewhere
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
outdoor
activities
is
climbing
i
love
the
challenge
of
pushing
myself
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
being
surrounded
by
stunning
views
and
feeling
a
sense
of
accomplishment
when
i
reach
the
summit
it
s
a
great
way
to
stay
active
stay
in
touch
with
nature
and
get
a
break
from
the
monotony
of
everyday
life
soccer
is
one
of
the
most
popular
and
widely played
sports
in
the
world
from
to
to
it
is
a
huge
part
of
many
cultures
running
track
and
field
differs
from
other
sports
by
its
individual
and
team
events
s
and
women
s
basketball
have
many
differences
like
the
ball
size
and
court
dimensions
but
both
have
professional
leagues
and
competition
all
over
the
world
softball
looks
and
feels
very
similar
to
baseball
but
the
rules
and
equipment
are
significantly
different
track
and
field
is
my
favorite
sport
because
it
s
a
great
way
to
stay
in
shape
and
there
are
so
many
different
skills
to
master
and
events
to
participate
in
is
a
power
speed
and
endurance
challenge
all
in
one
and
every
race
is
a
chance
to
improve
on
your
personal
results
seeking
multiple
perspectives
on
a
particular
problem
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
we
all
have
different
life
experiences
and
personal
insights
and
speaking
to
other
people
allows
us
to
take
their
opinions
into
consideration
as
well
navigating
a
difficult
problem
can
often
be
overwhelming
especially
when
trying
to
figure
it
out
on
your
own
by
opening
up
to
others
you
can
gain
access
to
a
variety
of
different
outlooks
in
order
to
broaden
your
viewpoint
ultimately
asking
multiple
people
for
advice
can
provide
greater
clarity
and
understanding
of
the
situation

a
fuller
assessment
and

the
best
decision
for
yourself
plus
speaking
with
others
can
help
put
your
own
worries
into
perspective
allowing
you
to
remain
level headed
when
making
a
decision
seeking
multiple
opinions
is
an
invaluable
tool
to
have
in
your
arsenal
offering
invaluable
insights
and
clarity
one
promising
way
to
benefit
both
younger
and
older
students
in
schools
is
to
implement
a
learning
program
this
program
has
the
potential
to
benefit
students
in
a
range
of
ways
for
younger
students
the
program
can
be
a
safe
and
consistent
environment
to
learn
in
that
can
help
them
cope
with
any
difficulties
at
home
the
program
can
also
help
older
students
with
their
service
hours
as
well
as
with
their
college
resumes
by
adding
to
their
impressive
list
of
activities
and
experience
by
investing
in
a
learning
program
both
younger
and
older
students
can
benefit
from
a
safe
space
to
learn
and
grow
when
it
comes
to
classrooms
having
teachers
design
projects
for
students
can
be
just
as
beneficial
as
having
students
come
up
with
their
own
ideas
in
my
experience
having
a
teacher designed
project
gave
me
a
starting
point
to
expanding
my
knowledge
and
learning
instead
of
having
to
think
of
an
idea
from
scratch
i
had
a
framework
to
work
off
of
the
challenge
was
figuring
out
ways
to
take
that
project
and
make
it
my
own
instead
of
feeling
overwhelmed
with
the
project
i
could
focus
on
understanding
the
concepts
i
was
presented
with
and
use
that
knowledge
to
come
up
with
my
own
creative
solutions
or
ideas
has
also
suggested
that
when
teachers
structure
and
guide
learning
it
leads
to
better
academic
outcomes
for
students
a
study
published
in
the
of
and
in
sciences
showed
that
when
students
were
given
guidance
structure
and
support
their
overall
learning
experience
improved
specifically
when
teachers
designed
projects
students
reported
feeling
more
confident
and
comfortable
in
their
learning
environment
in
conclusion
having
teachers
design
projects
provides
many
benefits
for
students
that
they
wouldn
t
experience
if
they
were
designing
them
on
their
own
it
is
an
effective
way
to
guide
student
learning
and
understanding
while
still
allowing
students
to
express
their
creativity
and
come
up
with
their
own
solutions
in
recent
years
an
increasing
number
of
students
have
brought
cell
phones
to
school
this
has
created
a
debate
around
the
issue
of
allowing
students
to
use
these
devices
during
passing
periods
and
lunch
time
on
the
one
hand
cell
phones
can
provide
convenience
lowering
the
cost
of
communication
between
families
and
providing
a
connection
to
emergency
services
should
the
need
arise
on
the
other
hand
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
during
passing
period
and
lunch
time
can
be
a
source
of
distraction
as
well
as
a
challenge
to
teacher
authority
from
a
convenience
perspective
cell
phones
allow
students
to
stay
in
touch
with
their
families
more
easily
and
cheaply
than
ever
before
this
can
provide
peace
of
mind
to
both
parents
and
students
as
parents
can
be
assured
that
their
children
are
safe
and
that
they
are
able
to
contact
them
quickly
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
in
addition
cell
phones
can
provide
access
to
educational
tools
such
as
instructional
videos
and
online
resources
that
can
supplement
a
student
s
studies
however
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
passing
periods
and
lunch
time
can
lead
to
distractions
such
as
playing
games
texting
or
social
media
surfing
this
can
interfere
with
learning
as
it
can
take
students
attention
away
from
their
academics
in
addition
allowing
students
to
use
cell
phones
can
be
a
challenge
to
teacher
authority
as
it
can
be
difficult
for
teachers
to
ensure
that
students
are
not
using
their
phones
during
class
time
ultimately
a
decision
must
be
made
about
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
passing
periods
and
lunch
time
while
there
are
clear
advantages
to
allowing
cell
phones
such
as
convenience
and
possible
access
to
educational
resources
there
are
also
risks
such
as
distractions
and
challenging
teachers
authority
therefore
these
pros
and
cons
must
be
weighed
carefully
as
administrators
determine
the
best
policy
for
their
school
attending
a
high
school
program
that
offers
students
the
opportunity
to
graduate
in
three
years
versus
four
years
presents
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
one
hand
a
three year
program
provides
students
with
the
opportunity
to
jumpstart
college
or
university
studies
and
potentially
move
quickly
into
their
career
it
also
gives
students
more
flexibility
in
their
schedule
allowing
them
to
take
extra
courses
or
pursue
extracurricular
activities
in
their
fourth
year
of
study
on
the
other
hand
students
miss
out
on
the
social
opportunities
provided
by
the
fourth
year
of
high
school
studies
which
can
give
them
an
advantage
when
applying
for
college
or
for
a
job
some
students
may
not
be
ready
for
the
academic
and
emotional
demands
of
a
three year
program
due
to
not
having
the
maturity
to
handle
the
rigors
of
such
a
program
ultimately
deciding
whether
to
attend
a
three
or
four
year
program
is
an
important
decision
each
having
their
own
set
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
while
there
have
been
more
traditional
ways
of
taking
classes
throughout
educational
history
the
emergence
of
online
courses
and
virtual
video
conferencing
have
made
it
possible
for
busy
students
and
those
living
far
away
from
their
desired
schools
to
benefit
from
quality
education
these
classes
present
more
convenience
to
those
who
have
a
baby
or
who
need
to
go
to
work
allowing
them
to
complete
their
coursework
at
their
own
pace
and
in
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
in
an
online
setting
students
have
the
advantage
of
greater
flexibility
and
being
able
to
work
around
other
commitments
while
there
may
be
specific
deadlines
for
assignments
students
can
utilize
the
convenience
of
online
to
their
advantage
and
submit
work
when
it
s
most
convenient
for
them
additionally
online
coursework
provides
the
ability
to
access
material
from
multiple
resources
giving
students
a
more
in depth
understanding
of
the
course
for
students
living
far
away
from
their
school
taking
classes
through
video
conferencing
can
provide
many
of
the
same
advantages
virtual
meetings
with
professors
can
ensure
that
the
student
remains
engaged
and
is
able
to
interact
with
their
professor
much
in
the
same
way
as
if
they
were
in
a
physical
classroom
this
can
also
be
beneficial
for
those
who
may
not
be
able
to
attend
traditional
classes
such
as
those
with
physical
disabilities
overall
taking
classes
online
or
through
video
conferencing
can
provide
busy
students
and
those
interested
in
classes
with
more
convenience
with
no
physical
boundaries
educational
opportunities
are
enabled
for
those
who
may
not
otherwise
have
access
to
them
this
can
be
highly
beneficial
for
those
with
commitments
that
may
prevent
them
from
taking
classes
in
a
traditional
setting
and
can
open
up
many
learning
opportunities
for
students
many
children
today
are
faced
with
the
decision
of
what
they
should
do
after
school
while
some
opt
to
stay
home
and
relax
others
may
benefit
from
participating
in
organized
activities
offering
young
people
a
variety
of
activities
to
explore
can
enrich
their
lives
and
provide
invaluable
skills
and
experiences
engaging
in
activities
after
school
can
teach
children
work
ethic
organizational
skills
responsibility
and
discipline
through
organized
activities
adolescents
become
more
independent
and
develop
decision making
skills
they
learn
to
manage
their
time
and
prioritize
tasks
and
activities
in
addition
participating
in
activities
teaches
kids
how
to
work
and
cooperate
with
other
people
this
in
turn
leads
to
improved
communication
skills
which
are
essential
in
all
areas
of
life
joining
activities
also
provides
the
opportunity
to
meet
new
people
and
form
meaningful
connections
with
peers
coaches
and
adults
this
type
of
social
interaction
is
important
for
building
confidence
self esteem
resilience
and
healthy
relationships
through
organized
activities
kids
can
develop
their
passions
and
explore
new
interests
without
feeling
overwhelmed
in
conclusion
participating
in
activities
after
school
can
bring
numerous
benefits
to
children
s
lives
from
gaining
necessary
life
skills
and
learning
to
manage
time
to
forming
friendships
with
others
and
discovering
passions
kids
should
be
encouraged
to
engage
in
organized
activities
it
is
an
important
part
of
their
development
and
growth
the
benefits
of
taking
music
drama
or
art
classes
in
school
are
numerous
art
classes
can
help
students
practice
an
important
form
of
self expression
while
music
and
drama
classes
can
boost
confidence
and
cultivate
creative
problem solving
and
communication
skills
however
some
students
may
not
want
or
be
able
to
take
these
classes
for
various
personal
reasons
such
as
having
limited
free
time
or
feeling
overwhelmed
by
the
pressure
to
achieve
when
parents
force
their
children
to
take
such
classes
the
students
often
lose
their
motivation
to
perform
and
may
grow
to
resent
the
activity
as
a
result
it
is
often
argued
that
making
these
classes
compulsory
could
lead
to
a
loss
in
the
authenticity
of
the
activities
being
taught
students
may
lack
an
enthusiasm
for
learning
the
skills
required
for
the
class
and
this
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
their
interest
and
the
quality
of
their
work
ultimately
the
decision
to
take
music
drama
or
art
classes
should
be
driven
by
the
passion
of
the
student
if
the
student
truly
loves
an
activity
they
will
be
more
inclined
to
take
an
active
role
in
their
studies
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
activity
is
compulsory
drama
and
art
classes
are
often
classified
as
electives
offering
students
the
chance
to
explore
creative
subjects
in
a
meaningful
and
fun
way
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
implications
of
some
students
not
taking
these
classes
seriously
or
having
an
interest
in
specific
jobs
that
do
not
require
such
classes
on
one
hand
those
who
are
excited
and
engaged
by
these
topics
will
be
able
to
broaden
their
education
and
pursue
topics
they
are
interested
in
on
the
other
hand
those
who
do
not
find
these
classes
to
their
liking
may
be
missing
out
on
classes
that
offer
significant
life
skills
such
as
team
work
communication
and
analytical
thinking
it
is
important
to
assess
the
individual
needs
of
our
students
and
provide
access
to
a
wide
variety
of
classes
both
electives
and
core
classes
which
will
ultimately
prepare
them
for
any
career
of
their
choosing
is
a
game
that
is
filled
with
inspiration
and
influence
from
everyone
who
plays
it
the
successes
of
soccer
players
that
have
tried
different
things
to
grow
as
a
person
are
invaluable
an
example
of
this
is
who
tried
different
sports
activities
and
experiences
to
diversify
their
skill
set
and
expand
their
potential
this
has
contributed
to
their
personal
growth
and
improved
their
abilities
both
on
and
off
the
field
on
the
other
hand
there
are
players
like
that
specialize
in
what
they
have
mastered
and
still
achieve
success
however
while
both
scenarios
have
yielded
successful
results
there
is
a
greater
benefit
associated
with
trying
different
things
and
expanding
one
s
scope
it
allows
a
person
to
reach
greater
heights
of
achievement
and
avoid
stagnation
by
exploring
new
ideas
and
this
is
why
people
must
try
different
things
to
grow
as
a
person
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
huge
impacts
in
all
areas
of
life
in
terms
of
school
achievements
developing
a
positive
attitude
can
help
improve
academic
performance
such
as
studying
more
effectively
or
even
getting
higher
grades
in
exams
it
can
also
help
when
faced
with
solving
difficult
problems
as
looking
at
a
situation
from
a
positive
perspective
can
often
provide
the
motivation
needed
to
keep
going
in
terms
of
how
others
view
you
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
you
be
seen
as
reliable
and
trustworthy
people
are
more
likely
to
turn
to
you
for
help
or
advice
as
they
ll
appreciate
your
good
attitude
and
approach
this
can
open
up
more
opportunities
and
help
build
meaningful
relationships
in
the
long term
finally
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
hugely
beneficial
to
future
aspirations
it
can
help
to
keep
you
focused
and
motivated
no
matter
what
challenges
lie
ahead
it
also
opens
up
the
possibility
of
thinking
beyond
one
s
current
skillset
and
setting
loftier
goals
a
positive
attitude
can
therefore
be
hugely
pivotal
in
helping
to
reach
future
ambitions
loves
physical
education
classes
because
of
the
physical
and
social
benefits
it
provides
speaking
classes
allow
them
to
stay
active
and
learn
how
to
stay
healthy
furthermore
classes
can
be
played
on
school
grounds
which
helps
keep
engaged
and
having
fun
socially
classes
promote
teamwork
communication
and
consideration
of
others
the
positive
environment
encourages
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
their
peers
and
develop
new
skills
such
as
problem solving
and
collaboration
ultimately
these
emotional
and
physical
benefits
help
succeed
both
inside
and
outside
the
classroom
classes
are
a
great
way
to
set
an
example
and
positively
influence
others
s
enthusiasm
for
belonging
to
a
team
helps
younger
students
feel
welcomed
volunerable
comfortable
to
express
themselves
and
creates
an
inclusive
atmosphere
for
all
distance
learning
has
many
advantages
for
students
as
it
allows
them
to
save
time
and
money
by
eliminating
the
need
to
attend
physical
classes
for
those
juggling
work
and
family
commitments
distance
learning
offers
flexible
course
schedules
that
allow
them
to
attend
classes
as
their
schedules
allow
in
addition
a
wider
range
of
courses
and
materials
can
be
accessed
through
online
learning
compared
to
a
typical
classroom
setting
however
there
are
some
disadvantages
to
distance
learning
students
must
have
reliable
access
to
the
internet
and
be
proficient
with
technology
to
be
successful
additionally
there
is
less
direct
contact
between
instructors
and
students
so
it
can
be
difficult
to
get
feedback
promptly
furthermore
online
learners
may
miss
out
on
the
social
aspect
of
physical
classes
and
the
networking
opportunities
that
come
with
learning
alongside
others
for
instance
a
student
enrolled
in
an
online
degree
program
may
have
difficulty
forming
relationships
with
professors
which
can
make
it
difficult
to
land
internships
or
full time
job
opportunities
on
the
other
hand
an
on campus
student
may
be
able
to
develop
more
meaningful
connections
with
faculty
attend
networking
events
and
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
all
of
these
opportunities
can
help
the
student
to
expand
their
professional
and
personal
networks
self sufficiency
is
a
key
component
of
personal
growth
and
development
allowing
one
to
make
their
own
decisions
and
be
more
responsible
for
their
actions
developing
the
ability
to
think
independently
and
trust
one
s
own
judgement
can
provide
greater
control
over
one
s
life
however
seeking
guidance
from
experts
can
be
beneficial
for
understanding
complex
situations
as
it
can
provide
helpful
advice
and
support
this
external
help
can
help
to
develop
skills
and
provide
valuable
guidance
ultimately
it
is
a
matter
of
personal
preference
and
the
individual
s
individual
needs
should
be
taken
into
consideration
to
decide
the
most
beneficial
option
making
one
s
own
decisions
can
lead
to
a
greater
sense
of
independence
but
relying
on
external
help
can
be
just
as
beneficial
in
certain
circumstances
both
approaches
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
the
decision
should
take
into
account
the
implications
for
personal
growth
and
development
one
of
the
primary
differences
between
a
four year
high
school
program
and
a
three year
high
school
program
is
the
amount
of
time
available
for
students
to
study
a
four year
program
contains
more
time
for
students
to
delve
deeply
into
subject
areas
while
a
three year
program
might
offer
more
opportunities
to
complete
electives
or
take
additional
courses
thus
potentially
leading
to
improved
college
readiness
another
consideration
is
the
impact
of
taking
a
break
in
the
summer
months
which
four year
students
will
experience
while
three year
students
will
not
summer
break
can
offer
students
a
much
needed
respite
from
their
studies
but
it
can
also
lead
to
loss
of
knowledge
for
those
who
do
not
engage
in
learning
activities
during
this
period
furthermore
four year
students
will
have
an
additional
year
to
explore
extracurriculars
or
participate
in
programs
like
internships
but
three year
students
could
in
theory
have
more
flexibility
with
their
course
schedule
to
fit
in
nonacademic
pursuits
ultimately
both
four year
and
three year
programs
have
their
own
set
of
potential
benefits
for
students
however
the
decision
of
which
to
choose
should
be
based
on
an
individual
s
educational
needs
and
tendencies
graduating
early
from
high
school
can
provide
students
with
a
range
of
benefits
not
only
will
they
save
time
and
costs
but
they
ll
also
be
able
to
enter
the
job
market
earlier
however
it
is
n t
always
an
easy
option
for
students
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
some
students
do
n t
complete
high
school
such
as
financial
constraints
family
commitments
mental
health
issues
or
lack
of
resources
it
s
important
that
students
have
the
right
courses
and
skills
to
complete
high
school
such
as
the
core
subjects
of
math
science
and
the
responsibilities
of
parents
are
also
important
as
they
can
help
provide
emotional
and
practical
support
to
their
children
throughout
the
process
it
s
also
possible
to
complete
high
school
outside
of
traditional
classrooms
such
as
online
education
or
work
experience
programs
of
the
option
taken
graduating
high
school
is
essential
for
achieving
success
in
the
future
by
obtaining
a
high
school
diploma
students
can
demonstrate
their
commitment
to
academics
and
career
goals
having
a
positive
attitude
is
not
only
beneficial
to
our
overall
well being
but
it
also
impacts
our
personal
lives
and
careers
here
are
three
reasons
why
having
a
positive
attitude
should
be
a
priority
cultivating
a
positive
attitude
promotes
better
physical
health
those
with
a
positive
outlook
are
less
likely
to
experience
stress related
physical
problems
such
as
headaches
and
muscle
tension
additionally
research
has
found
that
positive
thinking
contributes
to
an
improved
sense
of
self worth
which
can
inspire
a
healthier
lifestyle
secondly
having
a
positive
attitude
can
improve
our
relationships
with
those
around
us
by
approaching
situations
with
optimism
we
can
become
better
communicators
and
problem
solvers
we
are
also
less
likely
to
come
off
as
defensive
or
aggressive
traits
that
can
make
it
difficult
to
form
trusting
relationships
finally
with
a
positive
attitude
we
are
more
likely
to
be
successful
in
our
studies
and
careers
it
has
been
proven
that
people
who
think
positively
are
more
likely
to
see
difficult
tasks
as
a
challenge
and
thereby
take
them
on
with
enthusiasm
as
a
result
those
individuals
are
more
likely
to
reach
their
desired
goals
having
a
positive
attitude
can
drastically
improve
our
lives
both
personally
and
professionally
with
the
right
outlook
we
can
become
healthier
form
deeper
relationships
and
achieve
our
goals
with
greater
ease
it
is
often
said
that
first
impressions
are
everything
and
they
can
have
a
powerful
influence
on
how
we
view
another
person
but
is
it
always
the
case
that
first
impressions
are
accurate
the
truth
is
first
impressions
can
change
after
we
get
to
know
a
person
this
has
been
supported
both
by
personal
experiences
and
factual
evidence
on
a
personal
level
i
have
found
that
sometimes
my
first
impressions
of
someone
have
proven
to
be
inaccurate
after
getting
to
know
them
better
a
few
years
ago
i
met
someone
who
immediately
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
on
the
surface
they
seemed
cocky
and
rude
but
as
i
got
to
know
them
better
this
person
eventually
became
one
of
my
closest
friends
it
turns
out
they
were
actually
quite
humble
and
kind
and
i
was
glad
that
i
decided
to
give
them
a
chance
despite
my
first
impressions
this
idea
has
also
been
supported
by
academic
research
in
a
study
researchers
asked
participants
to
watch
brief
videos
of
strangers
and
form
an
impression
the
study
found
that
the
more
information
participants
had
about
the
persons
in
the
video
the
more
their
first
impression
changed
these
findings
suggest
that
the
more
interaction
we
have
with
someone
the
more
our
initial
impression
of
them
may
change
overall
it
appears
that
first
impressions
are
not
always
an
accurate
indicator
of
someone
s
personality
or
character
this
is
why
it
is
important
to
look
beyond
the
surface
of
any
person
and
get
to
know
them
better
all
too
often
a
knee jerk
reaction
to
a
first
impression
can
lead
to
judgments
that
are
not
entirely
valid
and
might
be
better
described
as
an
educated
guess
has
a
profound
impact
on
the
success
of
an
individual
s
life
journey
when
approached
with
a
positive
attitude
the
opportunities
come
in
increasing
abundance
helping
to
ensure
that
the
individual
s
success
reaches
its
ultimate
potential
when
approached
with
a
negative
attitude
the
individual
s
self destructive
attitude
takes
over
the
entire
environment
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
individual
s
life
and
those
around
them
one
of
the
most
effective
ways
to
ensure
a
positive
attitude
is
to
set
realistic
goals
this
not
only
provides
validation
of
where
the
individual
is
currently
but
also
provides
a
roadmap
to
success
that
is
manageable
and
achievable
with
this
roadmap
in
mind
it
is
important
to
stay
focused
on
those
realistic
goals
and
to
maintain
an
attitude
that
is
realistic
yet
optimistic
breeds
success
setting
someone
up
for
the
long term
success
that
they
orignally
sought
out
to
reach
making
the
conscious
decision
to
stay
positive
enables
someone
to
face
difficult
situations
better
and
handle
the
roller
coaster
ride
of
life
s
waves
with
grace
it
also
helps
to
take
each
step
of
the
journey
with
more
enthusiasm
and
passion
something
that
leads
to
better
focus
and
greater
self belief
having
the
right
attitude
also
contributes
to
having
a
more
meaningful
life
beyond
material
gains
is
also
an
attitude
that
can
be
controlled
it
can
be
trained
through
regular
practice
of
self care
and
being
mindful
of
day to day
thoughts
and
emotions
establishing
a
practice
of
gratitude
also
helps
to
foster
an
attitude
of
optimism
which
is
essential
to
achieve
success
in
life
it
is
important
to
make
sure
our
attitude
remains
positive
and
stays
true
to
our
values
having
a
good
attitude
is
essential
to
success
in
life
it
allows
individuals
to
stay
focused
and
inspired
to
achieve
their
goals
by
setting
realistic
goals
practicing
positive
self talk
and
developing
a
practice
of
gratitude
any
individual
can
control
their
attitude
to
better
their
life
and
the
lives
of
those
around
them
relying
on
others
is
an
essential
part
of
life
we
often
do
n t
realize
the
importance
of
relying
on
others
until
faced
with
a
challenge
that
we
can
not
handle
on
our
own
this
doesn
t
mean
that
complete
dependence
on
another
person
is
ideal
instead
we
should
strive
for
a
balance
of
individual
action
and
cooperation
individuals
should
strive
for
independence
and
self sufficiency
these
are
valuable
traits
and
often
they
can
carry
a
person
through
difficult
times
but
relying
on
others
gives
us
the
support
we
need
to
tackle
even
greater
challenges
it
allows
us
to
pool
resources
and
ideas
expanding
the
range
of
possibilities
working
with
others
forces
us
to
think
outside
the
box
and
break
away
from
our
limited
perspectives
more
importantly
relying
on
others
helps
us
to
build
meaningful
relationships
we
can
learn
from
their
experiences
and
share
our
own
creating
an
environment
of
trust
encouragement
and
understanding
without
these
connections
individuals
can
be
left
feeling
isolated
and
disempowered
in
the
end
knowing
when
to
lean
on
others
and
when
to
be
independent
is
the
key
to
a
fulfilling
and
successful
life
relying
on
others
is
not
about
being
weak
or
dependent
it
is
about
seeing
the
strength
in
community
and
recognizing
the
importance
of
our
shared
resources
with
the
help
of
others
there
is
no
end
to
the
heights
that
we
can
reach
extending
school
hours
has
become
a
controversial
issue
among
educators
parents
and
students
alike
supporters
of
this
plan
argue
that
it
would
offer
students
more
quality
time
to
focus
on
their
studies
develop
skills
and
interact
with
their
instructors
however
there
are
also
those
who
argue
that
extending
school
hours
would
put
too
much
stress
on
students
and
disrupt
their
already
tight
schedules
the
pros
of
extending
school
hours
are
numerous
firstly
students
would
have
more
time
to
focus
on
their
academics
school
hours
make
it
possible
for
teachers
to
spend
more
time
exploring
complex
topics
and
for
students
to
build
deeper
understanding
of
course
material
secondly
extending
school
hours
could
offer
students
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
extracurricular
activities
with
more
time
available
students
could
participate
in
councils
and
activities
that
promote
problem solving
and
teamwork
lastly
it
could
give
students
an
opportunity
to
interact
more
with
teachers
spending
more
time
with
instructors
outside
of
the
classroom
can
help
create
a
closer
more
meaningful
student teacher
relationship
on
the
other
hand
longer
school
hours
could
also
result
in
stressful
conditions
for
students
already
tight
student family
schedules
could
be
disrupted
due
to
the
added
time
commitment
in
addition
spending
more
time
in
the
classroom
puts
more
strain
on
students
who
are
already
trying
to
balance
school
with
other
responsibilities
such
as
sports
teams
internships
and
jobs
some
argue
that
extended
hours
could
extend
to
a
loss
of
valuable
sleep
resulting
in
poorer
learning
outcomes
in
conclusion
there
are
some
valid
arguments
both
for
and
against
extending
school
hours
however
when
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
it
is
important
to
take
all
factors
into
consideration
and
ensure
that
any
potential
policy
changes
are
in
the
best
interests
of
all
involved
professional
soccer
in
the
late
required
immense
skill
and
hard
work
to
achieve
success
players
worked
tirelessly
perfecting
their
techniques
and
detail oriented
skills
while
simultaneously
developing
their
endurance
communication
was
also
imperative
to
the
success
of
the
game
during
this
period
the
ability
to
effectively
communicate
planned
plays
and
strategize
with
teammates
could
make
or
break
a
team
to
demonstrate
the
significance
of
both
talent
and
effort
i
d
like
to
use
the
example
of
a
fictional
soccer
player
was
a
naturally
talented
player
possessing
the
skills
necessary
to
lead
his
team
although
he
was
gifted
in
the
game
his
drive
and
determination
allowed
him
to
work
just
as
hard
as
his
teammates
thanks
to
the
combination
of
his
natural
talents
and
hardworking
attitude
and
his
teammates
achieved
success
on
the
field
in
conclusion
both
talent
and
hard
work
are
essential
for
success
in
professional
soccer
as
evidenced
by
the
role
communication
plays
in
the
game
and
the
example
of
s
combination
of
skill
and
dedication
without
communication
trust
in
team
dynamics
is
lost
as
is
the
opportunity
for
success
extending
the
school
day
has
been
a
hot
topic
of
debate
in
many
countries
for
a
variety
of
reasons
on
the
one
hand
some
research
suggests
that
by
adding
two
hours
to
the
school
day
students
could
be
exposed
to
a
greater
variety
of
topics
while
engaged
in
directed
learning
and
would
have
more
time
to
explore
their
individual
interests
on
the
other
hand
the
additional
hours
spent
in
the
classroom
could
be
seen
as
an
unnecessary
burden
with
student
wellbeing
and
learning
outcomes
suffering
due
to
fatigue
and
boredom
in
order
to
more
fully
understand
the
potential
implications
of
such
a
change
it
is
essential
to
consider
the
educational
context
in
which
this
decision
would
be
made
factors
such
as
the
age
of
the
students
and
the
quality
of
instruction
being
provided
as
well
as
the
availability
of
resources
and
support
structures
must
all
be
taken
into
account
ultimately
the
decision
to
extend
the
school
day
should
be
made
with
the
interests
of
students
at
heart
one
of
the
potential
benefits
of
changing
the
school
lunches
to
healthier
options
is
that
it
could
promote
better
health
outcomes
for
all
students
regardless
of
race
religion
or
body
type
fruits
vegetables
and
other
nutritious
foods
can
be
better
for
students
physical
health
and
many
nutritionists
recommend
more
plant based
proteins
like
beans
and
quinoa
when
possible
however
some
students
may
feel
excluded
if
there
are
fewer
foods
that
fit
in
with
their
religious
or
cultural
backgrounds
to
combat
this
schools
can
offer
a
variety
of
foods
from
around
the
globe
taking
into
account
dietary
guidelines
from
different
religions
and
culture
this
can
encourage
students
a
chance
to
explore
and
sample
dishes
that
they
may
not
have
had
access
to
before
while
also
promoting
a
more
inclusive
and
accepting
environment
in
addition
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
should
be
made
available
to
ensure
that
all
students
have
access
to
a
healthy
and
nutritious
meal
ultimately
making
the
shift
towards
healthier
school
lunches
can
be
beneficial
for
all
students
but
careful
consideration
must
be
taken
to
involve
and
accommodate
all
populations
in
the
process
learning
in
a
traditional
school
setting
and
online
school
have
some
distinct
differences
in
a
traditional
school
students
can
interact
with
their
peers
and
teachers
face
to
face
and
have
access
to
supplementary
educational
support
such
as
the
library
or
extra curricular
activities
in
an
online
school
setting
students
are
more
independent
in
their
learning
as
they
can
access
the
courses
asynchronously
form
any
location
when
considering
which
setting
is
better
for
students
it
depends
on
the
individual
needs
of
the
student
a
traditional
school
setting
may
benefit
a
student
who
needs
structure
and
the
support
system
that
is
available
in
school
an
online
school
may
be
more
suitable
for
a
student
who
is
intrinsically
motivated
and
can
work
independently
therefore
it
is
important
to
consider
the
individual
learning
needs
of
the
student
when
selecting
the
best
school
setting
the
power
of
action
is
undeniable
doing
something
no
matter
how
small
can
often
lead
to
greater
accomplishments
consider
the
importance
of
taking
the
first
step
in
any
endeavor
whether
it
s
finally
getting
that
new
project
off
the
ground
launching
a
business
or
simply
cleaning
out
the
garage
it
all
starts
with
taking
action
and
the
more
action
we
take
the
higher
the
likelihood
of
achieving
success
when
we
remain
idle
our
options
become
limited
we
can
sit
and
dream
about
what
we
want
and
even
plan
our
next
move
but
until
we
get
up
and
do
something
those
dreams
will
remain
just
that
dreams
oftentimes
the
solutions
we
seek
exist
in
plain
sight
but
we
will
never
find
them
if
we
re
not
actively
looking
taking
action
also
helps
us
face
our
fears
for
many
of
us
it
is
the
fear
of
failure
that
holds
us
back
when
we
remain
idle
we
can
come
up
with
all
kinds
of
excuses
as
to
why
we
can
t
do
something
doing
something
helps
us
view
our
fears
and
challenge
them
head
on
we
may
not
always
succeed
but
by
taking
action
we
at
least
have
a
chance
of
success
it
s
easy
to
get
stuck
in
a
state
of
inaction
but
we
have
to
remember
the
importance
of
making
a
move
doing
something
can
lead
to
countless
opportunities
our
actions
become
our
accomplishments
and
ultimately
they
determine
how
far
we
can
go
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
of
schools
controlling
student
involvement
in
extracurricular
activities
is
that
it
allows
for
a
balanced
approach
to
education
and
career
decisions
by
managing
the
types
and
number
of
extracurricular
activities
students
are
involved
in
schools
can
ensure
students
receive
all
the
necessary
information
to
decide
on
an
optimal
course
for
their
future
for
example
rather
than
having
students
commit
to
a
single
activity
or
hobby
a
carefully
managed
balance
of
multiple
extracurricular
activities
helps
students
explore
all
potential
interests
make
informed
decisions
and
find
the
perfect
match
to
their
academic
career
path
this
in
turn
increases
their
chances
of
success
and
significantly
improves
their
overall
student
experience
one
of
the
greatest
examples
of
success
against
the
odds
is
a
champion
olympian
who
overcame
childhood
polio
to
become
one
of
the
greatest
sprinters
in
history
despite
hardships
she
pursued
her
goal
of
athletic
greatness
and
achieved
it
against
all
odds
even
when
presented
with
failure
saw
it
as
a
learning
experience
and
she
was
motivated
to
strive
for
the
success
she
deserved
along
with
her
own
hard
work
she
was
driven
by
her
determination
and
a
determination
to
reach
her
own
potential
rather
than
aiming
low
and
potentially
missing
out
on
success
it
is
better
to
aim
higher
and
work
hard
to
make
one
s
dreams
come
true
with
hard
work
dedication
and
the
will
to
strive
for
success
great
things
can
be
achieved
no
matter
the
odds
achieving
partially
is
better
than
not
achieving
at
all
and
the
possibility
of
not
reaching
a
goal
is
far
less
than
the
possibility
of
success
ultimately
it
is
better
to
aim
high
and
strive
for
success
as
it
can
be
used
as
a
learning
experience
and
motivator
to
reach
for
one
s
goals
technological
innovations
have
completely
transformed
the
way
that
people
work
communicate
and
shop
from
the
smartphone
to
self driving
cars
technology
has
rapidly
developed
and
expanded
our
capabilities
and
spatial
reach
technology
allows
us
to
stay
connected
with
friends
and
family
no
matter
how
far
they
are
away
shopping
has
allowed
people
to
purchase
virtually
anything
all
from
the
comfort
of
their
home
has
also
enabled
people
to
be
more
efficient
in
their
tasks
and
activities
automation
has
made
it
possible
to
do
mundane
tasks
in
a
fraction
of
the
time
as
before
it
is
also
opening
up
opportunities
to
learn
new
skills
in
real time
that
would
have
otherwise
required
formal
education
can
provide
rapid
access
to
resources
information
and
the
latest
news
in
an
instant
however
there
are
some
potential
negative
impacts
of
technology
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
excessive
usage
can
lead
to
addiction
where
users
are
unable
to
switch
off
or
take
necessary
breaks
information
overload
can
lead
to
information
fatigue
and
lack
of
physical
exercise
as
a
result
of
device
usage
is
known
to
have
hazardous
effects
on
our
health
technology
and
science
have
been
responsible
for
a
number
of
beneficial
advances
in
our
society
however
when
used
in
excess
and
with
little
self control
it
can
have
a
negative
influence
on
our
lives
as
technology
continues
to
evolve
and
progress
it
is
imperative
to
consider
the
consequences
of
its
use
and
to
ensure
it
is
used
responsibly
and
in
the
right
context
attending
school
and
studying
online
both
offer
different
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
students
one
of
the
primary
benefits
of
attending
school
is
the
social
interaction
students
are
able
to
make
friends
in
class
have
more
interactions
with
teachers
and
other
adults
in
the
school
and
form
relationships
with
their
classmates
this
educational
environment
is
also
beneficial
when
it
comes
to
developing
responsibility
while
at
school
students
also
learn
how
to
be
accountable
for
themselves
and
others
when
it
comes
to
academic
commitments
following
directions
and
paying
attention
in
class
additionally
attending
school
ensures
that
students
get
a
healthy
diet
with
access
to
nutritious
meals
throughout
the
day
on
the
other
hand
studying
online
and
taking
online
classes
allows
students
to
work
at
their
own
pace
learn
on
their
own
terms
and
follow
an
educational
path
that
best
fits
their
individual
needs
learning
provides
more
flexibility
for
students
as
they
can
attend
classes
whenever
they
are
available
and
not
have
to
worry
about
staying
on
a
specific
schedule
additionally
online
students
may
have
more
resources
and
course
material
available
as
they
can
access
them
from
their
own
devices
although
both
options
provide
great
opportunities
the
best
option
for
students
will
depend
on
their
individual
needs
and
preferences
attending
school
has
its
advantages
particularly
with
its
social
aspect
while
studying
online
provides
more
freedom
and
flexibility
choosing
the
most
beneficial
option
needs
to
be
determined
on
a
case by case
basis
as
both
options
have
their
own
unique
pros
and
cons
taking
into
consideration
the
potential
advantages
of
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
research
has
been
conducted
to
develop
an
action

data
from
a
recent
survey
of
stakeholders
in
the
education
sector
showed
of
those
polled
including
teachers
students
and
administrators
expressed
support
of
the
idea
the
extra
hour
and
a
half
could
be
composed
of
two
minute
blocks
of
instructional
time
and
one
minute
block
of
time
for

this
would
provide

lectures
and
experiential
learning
opportunities
for
students
as
well
as
allow
teachers
to
better

exercise
social
interaction
and
more
time

bodies
and
positive
psychological

an
action
plan
to
ensure

to
efficiently
and
effectively
use
the
time
available
exploring
funding
and
staffing
sources
and
monitoring
and
adjusting
the
plan
as
necessary
we
believe
that
this
action
plan
could
be
a
valuable
resource
for
schools
interested
in
adding
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
when
we
encounter
difficult
obstacles
and
challenges
in

when
we
need
to
ask
for

by
seeking
out
guidance
from
those
who
have
been

the
potential
consequences
of
disobeying
curfew
for
teenagers
can
be
severe
depending
on
the
city
or
state
where
the
curfew
is
being
enforced
if
the
curfew
is
established
by
law
then
it
is
punishable
by
law
depending
on
the
severity
of
the
offense
legal
penalties
can
range
from
fines
to
jail
time
for
those
who
live
in
a
city
or
state
that
does
not
have
a
statutory
curfew
breaking
curfew
can
still
result
in
consequences
from
the
parents
such
as
restricted
access
to
cars
and
phones
fewer
privileges
or
grounding
as
an
alternative
to
legal
penalties
parents
can
choose
to
impose
other
forms
of
discipline
such
as
discussion
restriction
of
privileges
or
other
punishments
ultimately
it
is
important
that
parents
and
teens
understand
the
consequences
of
breaking
curfew
and
take
the
necessary
steps
to
ensure
it
is
followed
gathering
materials
for
the
ultimate
prank
i
just
bought
a
big
box
with
a
hand sized
hole
from
and
i
grabbed
a
handful
of
materials
from
below
for
some
creative
pranking
i
ve
been
researching
different
pranks
used
by
other
creators
and
brainstorming
ways
to
make
them
my
own
the
ultimate
prank
will
involve
testing
out
these
creative
pranks
on
my
family
members
first
then
experimenting
with
pranks
in
public
my
plan
is
to
surprise
people
with
fake
items
placed
on
the
ground
and
use
materials
like
robotic
tools
to
catch
them
off
guard
i
m
ready
to
create
some
unforgettable
prank
moments
having
a
positive
attitude
is
often
touted
as
a
key
to
success
but
is
it
really
the
only
factor
to
consider
in
life
it
is
true
that
having
an
optimistic
outlook
has
a
range
of
benefits
it
can
make
it
easier
to
accomplish
goals
and
build
relationships
but
there
are
also
times
when
maintaining
a
neutral
or
even
negative
attitude
is
more
relevant
going
in
with
an
overly positive
mindset
can
be
counterproductive
as
it
may
lead
to
unrealistic
expectations
and
a
frustrating
lack
of
progress
with
this
situation
an
individual
may
be
too
eager
to
believe
that
any
obstacles
can
be
easily
overcome
when
in
reality
additional
challenges
may
be
encountered
on
the
other
hand
adopting
a
more
practical
and
measured
approach
one
that
does
not
involve
ignoring
potential
roadblocks
or
issues
can
allow
an
individual
to
remain
calm
and
remain
focused
on
their
goal
having
a
negative
attitude
can
also
be
damaging
as
it
is
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
and
disheartened
a
pessimistic
attitude
is
unlikely
to
lead
to
fruitful
endeavors
as
it
can
prevent
an
individual
from
taking
risks
or
challenging
themselves
in
worthwhile
ways
additionally
a
pessimistic
outlook
can
also
tarnish
relationships
making
it
difficult
to
form
meaningful
connections
with
those
around
you
ultimately
having
the
right
balance
between
optimism
and
pessimism
is
key
to
finding
success
in
life
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
potential
risks
and
difficulties
but
also
have
an
underlying
positive
outlook
which
encourages
progress
identifying
and
creating
for
yourself
a
realistic
positive
attitude
which
remains
open
minded
to
all
possibilities
is
the
best
approach
for
finding
success
in
any
endeavour
throughout
life
first
impressions
are
incredibly
important
the
way
a
person
is
initially
perceived
based
on
looks
body
language
and
attitude
all
play
a
significant
role
in
how
they
are
initially
viewed
however
while
looks
and
body
language
are
the
ones
that
are
usually
noticed
first
it
is
ultimately
the
attitude
and
communication
skills
of
a
person
that
can
completely
change
a
first
impression
when
it
comes
to
looks
it
is
often
said
that
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
finding
someone
attractive
or
not
can
depend
upon
someone
s
individual
opinion
or
preferences
however
a
person
s
fashion
sense
the
clothes
and
accessories
they
wear
and
even
their
grooming
habits
can
also
change
the
way
they
are
perceived
by
making
straightforward
changes
in
all
of
these
areas
one
s
initial
impression
can
be
improved
a
person
s
personality
may
also
be
a
factor
in
changing
a
first
impression
because
it
is
often
easier
to
see
a
person
s
true
nature
once
conversation
has
been
established
someone
who
is
animated
and
interesting
can
be
much
more
attractive
than
someone
who
is
shy
and
withdrawn
if
a
person
can
show
that
they
are
genuinely
sociable
open minded
and
well rounded
this
can
often
counter
any
experience
or
appearance
that
was
negative
at
first
finally
communication
skills
play
a
big
part
in
how
a
first
impression
is
perceived
the
ability
to
articulate
one
s
thoughts
and
communicate
clearly
can
be
a
very
powerful
tool
in
making
a
positive
impression
it
is
usually
impossible
to
hide
questionable
communication
skills
so
by
honing
this
aspect
of
one
s
personality
it
is
possible
to
make
a
lasting
impression
therefore
through
one
s
looks
personality
and
communication
a
first
impression
can
and
should
be
managed
so
that
an
individual
can
make
the
best
possible
impact
when
meeting
someone
for
the
first
time
by
making
just
a
few
minor
changes
a
lasting
impression
can
be
left
on
another
person
that
can
outshine
any
first
impression
based
on
initial
appearances
the
origin
of
character
traits
is
an
important
topic
that
has
had
an
immense
influence
on
people
throughout
the
course
of
history
examples
of
character
traits
such
as
courage
or
confidence
that
are
related
to
personal
success
can
be
seen
in
various
ways
influence
has
often
played
a
major
role
in
determining
a
person
s
character
traits
with
the
values
and
beliefs
that
are
developed
in
one
s
home
life
having
a
lasting
impact
traits
are
important
tools
for
achieving
future
success
as
well
with
people
who
have
strong
personal
values
often
able
to
chart
successful
paths
in
life
traits
can
also
be
used
to
form
one
s
identity
with
people
using
them
to
establish
a
sense
of
self esteem
and
direction
it
is
therefore
essential
to
have
an
understanding
of
one
s
own
character
traits
as
this
can
lead
to
improved
confidence
and
personal
fulfillment
in
conclusion
the
origin
and
influence
of
character
traits
is
an
extremely
relevant
matter
that
can
have
far reaching
implications
in
regards
to
a
person
s
life
and
identity
phones
have
become
an
integral
part
of
today
s
society
and
the
different
perspectives
on
whether
they
should
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
can
spark
debate
on
one
hand
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
in
the
classroom
can
be
beneficial
since
students
can
access
educational
resources
online
easily
contact
family
members
or
friends
or
take
notes
digitally
however
cell
phones
can
also
be
a
major
distraction
as
students
may
play
games
or
browse
social
media
sites
leading
to
wasted
class
time
and
potentially
distracting
other
students
in
my
opinion
there
should
be
a
balance
between
allowing
the
use
of
cell
phones
and
banning
them
classroom
rules
should
be
established
regarding
cell
phone
use
for
instance
permitting
students
to
use
them
for
taking
notes
during
lectures
or
for
researching
information
online
while
also
forbidding
their
use
during
other
activities
such
as
discussions
or
group
work
when
used
properly
cell
phones
have
the
potential
to
be
very
beneficial
in
a
classroom
setting
however
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
potential
for
distraction
in
order
to
ensure
that
students
remain
focused
on
their
school
work
going
outside
can
be
a
great
way
to
get
some
exercise
and
relax
your
mind
with
the
lovely
sunshine
and
fresh
air
you
can
take
in
the
beauty
of
nature
and
make
the
most
of
the
outdoors
participating
in
outdoor
activities
with
friends
and
family
can
have
many
benefits
such
as
improving
physical
and
mental
health
and
can
be
more
enjoyable
than
just
going
to
the
gym
for
physical
activity
going
to
the
park
can
be
a
great
way
to
get
some
exercise
and
fun
in
with
lots
of
activities
such
as
playing
sports
biking
or
scootering
walking
running
and
more
so
it
s
perfect
for
any
group
or
individual
this
kind
of
exercise
can
be
great
for
physical
health
but
the
mental
benefits
should
not
be
underestimated
connecting
with
nature
and
participating
in
real
world
activities
can
help
to
reduce
stress
and
can
be
especially
beneficial
for
those
who
have
experienced
mental
wellbeing
issues
overall
it
s
clear
that
getting
outside
and
enjoying
the
world
around
us
even
if
it
s
just
for
a
little
while
can
be
a
great
way
to
improve
physical
and
mental
health
the
introduction
of
a
four day
work
week
has
the
potential
to
have
a
positive
impact
on
a
variety
of
economic
environmental
and
social
elements
for
employers
there
could
be
a
reduction
in
overhead
costs
due
to
fewer
hours
worked
each
week
resulting
in
a
more
budget friendly
labor
force
additionally
employees
could
benefit
from
increased
job
satisfaction
and
more
flexible
hours
allowing
them
to
better
manage
their
home
and
work
lives
in
terms
of
environmental
conservation
a
four day
work
week
could
result
in
a
significant
decrease
in
energy
and
fuel
consumption
as
well
as
a
reduction
in
air
pollution
finally
a
shorter
work
week
could
make
a
positive
social
impact
on
workers
as
studies
have
found
that
a
four day
work
week
could
lead
to
improved
mental
and
physical
health
greater
productivity
and
increased
overall
well being
is
a
concept
that
has
long
been
celebrated
and
valued
in
today
s
world
being
an
individual
is
more
important
than
ever
before
it
is
a
way
of
embracing
our
uniqueness
and
expressing
ourselves
fully
this
is
why
my
parents
have
always
encouraged
me
to
be
an
individual
from
an
early
age
they
taught
me
the
importance
of
making
my
own
decisions
and
developing
my
own
ideas
as
a
young
adult
i
have
taken
this
philosophy
more
seriously
particularly
in
my
professional
life
when
i
considered
starting
my
own
business
i
had
to
make
the
individual
decision
of
whether
it
was
the
right
move
for
me
ultimately
i
chose
to
take
a
risk
and
follow
my
dreams
this
has
been
an
incredibly
rewarding
experience
and
has
taught
me
how
powerful
it
can
be
to
make
individual
decisions
many
authors
have
explored
the
concept
of
individuality
in
their
works
s
novel
the
is
a
great
example
of
this
featuring
an
individual
s
quest
for
the
truth
his
literary
adaptation
of
similarly
focuses
on
an
individual
s
journey
towards
self discovery
even
when
referring
to
historical
events
the
idea
of
individuals
impacting
the
course
of
history
is
evident
through
figures
such
as
and
in
conclusion
individuality
is
something
to
be
celebrated
and
embraced
in
today
s
world
making
individual
decisions
and
going
our
own
way
can
be
frightening
but
it
is
ultimately
very
rewarding
great
individuals
throughout
history
have
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
world
and
i
believe
that
each
and
every
one
of
us
can
do
the
same
in
his
famous
essay
wrote
in
this
world
be
yourself
this
statement
speaks
to
the
power
of
self confidence
and
the
freedom
that
comes
from
being
your
own
unique
self
when
you
are
confident
in
who
you
are
and
what
you
stand
for
your
path
to
success
can
be
unstoppable
patience
and
hard
work
are
essential
in
reaching
success
but
it
is
also
vital
to
have
a
variety
of
skills
by
experimenting
you
can
learn
which
skills
are
needed
for
your
success
accomplishment
accompanies
success
and
it
is
important
to
savor
that
feeling
in
order
to
stay
motivated
following
s
advice
of
being
yourself
can
lead
to
greatness
no
matter
your
journey
on
the
way
to
success
remembering
his
suggestion
can
help
guide
you
onto
the
right
path
and
school
success
are
intimately
intertwined
a
strong
and
positive
sense
of
self worth
can
form
the
foundations
for
a
student
to
reach
for
academic
goals
believing
in
their
ability
to
offer
solutions
and
challenge
intellectual
tasks
but
how
can
achieving
success
in
school
help
promote
a
student
s
self esteem
although
the
journey
of
success
can
be
long
and
winding
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
that
comes
from
achieving
goals
can
provide
a
sense
of
pride
that
is
essential
for
a
healthy
self esteem
as
students
become
more
successful
in
school
their
confidence
will
grow
and
they
will
be
more
willing
to
take
on
more
difficult
tasks
and
see
them
through
to
completion
a
strong
self esteem
is
the
cornerstone
to
success
in
school
and
achieving
success
in
school
can
help
to
reinforce
a
student
s
self esteem
further
imagination
has
the
power
to
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
it
can
take
us
to
places
knowledge
may
not
be
able
to
go
allowing
us
to
think
outside
the
box
and
explore
uncharted
territory
it
has
the
ability
to
ignite
creativity
and
inspire
us
to
do
extraordinary
things
for
example
some
of
the
greatest
technological
breakthroughs
of
our
time
from
the
light
bulb
to
the
smartphone
began
as
mere
figments
of
someone
s
imagination
it
has
also
helped
countless
entrepreneurs
take
their
businesses
to
the
next
level
allowing
them
to
identify
opportunities
and
draw
up
innovative
solutions
that
have
achieved
unparalleled
success
while
knowledge
is
also
important
in
its
own
right
it
primarily
builds
upon
existing
ideas
in
comparison
imagination
allows
us
to
conceive
entirely
new
ideas
and
generate
pioneering
solutions
it
encourages
us
to
be
more
inquisitive
curious
and
visionary
it
gives
us
the
courage
to
take
risks
and
propel
us
to
strive
for
excellence
ultimately
a
balance
between
imagination
and
knowledge
is
essential
having
knowledge
gives
us
the
confidence
to
pursue
our
wildest
dreams
while
imagination
gives
us
the
power
to
turn
these
dreams
into
reality
both
are
equally
essential
in
propelling
us
to
accomplish
the
extraordinary
excerpt
the
concept
that
people
choose
their
own
paths
in
life
is
one
that
has
been
widely
discussed
for
centuries
many
people
believe
that
we
are
responsible
for
forming
our
futures
while
others
feel
that
our
lives
are
determined
by
external
factors
there
are
various
elements
that
need
to
be
taken
into

confidence
and
decision
making
the

between
listening

and
making
your
own
decisions
and
how
all
of
these
factors
can
affect
a
person
s
path
in
life
all
of
these
things
are
important
to
consider
when
attempting
to
analyze
the
idea
that
people
choose
their

paths
in

can
help
improve
a

variety
of
ways
for
example
students
can
learn
the
proper
techniques
for
applying
cosmetics
how
to
choose
the
right
products
and
how
to
stay
up
to
date
on
the

in
the
future
making
a
positive
first
impression
is
immensely
important
when
meeting
someone
for
the
first
time
it
can
have
a
powerful
effect
on
the
success
or
failure
of
any
relationship
be
it
with
a
colleague
friend
or
romantic
partner
a
positive
first
impression
can
lead
to
trust
successful
collaborations
and
meaningful
connections
while
a
negative
first
impression
can
quickly
ruin
an
opportunity
or
sour
a
relationship
take
job
opportunities
for
example
a
potential
employer
base
much
of
their
decisions
on
an
applicant
s
first
impression
studies
have
shown
that
applicants
who
are
well
groomed
confident
with
their
communication
and
present
themselves
with
respect
and
enthusiasm
are
much
more
likely
to
be
hired
the
same
principle
applies
when
looking
for
new
friends
or
romantic
partners
people
tend
to
be
attracted
to
confidence
and
enjoy
talking
to
someone
who
communicates
clearly
when
it
comes
to
establishing
good
relationships
with
peers
a
positive
first
impression
goes
a
long
way
people
who
are
kind
calm
and
welcoming
are
more
likely
to
be
liked
and
respected
it
s
almost
a
guarantee
that
an
individual
who
exudes
confidence
and
respect
will
make
a
better
impression
than
someone
who
exudes
anger
and
distrust
in
conclusion
it
is
incredibly
important
to
strive
for
a
positive
first
impression
when
meeting
someone
for
the
first
time
making
a
strong
first
impression
can
be
the
difference
between
getting
an
opportunity
or
losing
out
to
a
competitor
building
strong
relationships
or
souring
them
instantly
and
being
liked
by
peers
or
respected
by
them

been
used
throughout
history
as
a
way
to

different
forms
of
art
can
provide
different
levels
of

building
and
sculpting

you
can
open
up

to
your
emotional
benefit
having
a
successful
business
takes
more
than
just
good
ideas
and

work
numerous
factors
come
into
play
including
external
factors
such
as
the
economy
which
can
dramatically
affect
a
business
s
success
it
is
therefore
important
to
consider
all
possible
reasons
why
a
business
could
fail
and
devise
a
plan
to
help
business
owners
come
up
with
ideas
to
ensure
success
those
who
experience
failure
can
find
solace
in
the
stories
of
successful
people
who
overcame
their
struggles
and
rose
to
success
a
great
example
of
this
is
who
despite
suffering
many
disappointments
and
failures
in
his
lifetime
managed
to
make
a
huge
contribution
to
society
this
illustrates
the
importance
of
perseverance
and
continuing
to
pursue
goals
despite
any
setbacks
equally
an
effective
support
system
is
essential
for
those
going
through
difficult
times
providing
emotional
and
physical
assistance
to
those
who
need
it
making
decisions
is
an
integral
part
of
life
especially
during
the
teenage
years
during
high
school
teens
are
faced
with
choices
such
as
which
classes
to
take
what
extracurricular
activities
to
be
involved
in
and
how
to
manage
their
time
as
teens
approach
adulthood
they
have
to
make
more
important
decisions
such
as
which
college
or
university
to
attend
or
whether
to
pursue
a
trade
examples
of
decision making
from
high
school
to
years
old
include
deciding
which
classes
to
take
in
order
to
stay
on
track
for
graduation
choosing
which
colleges
or
universities
to
apply
to
and
which
one
to
attend
determining
what
career
path
to
take
and
whether
to
enter
the
workforce
or
continue
with
further
education
family
and
education
have
a
powerful
impact
on
an
individual
s
life
as
they
can
both
lead
to
success
studies
have
shown
that
those
who
are
raised
in
a
supportive
nurturing
home
environment
develop
stronger
social
and
emotional
skills
and
are
more
likely
to
succeed
similarly
high quality
education
is
believed
to
provide
individuals
with
the
knowledge
skills
and
confidence
to
compete
effectively
in
any
professional
environment
good
parenting
and
a
good
education
can
both
provide
children
with
a
strong
foundation
to
build
on
when
it
comes
to
success
in
life
parents
are
in
a
unique
position
to
shape
the
values
and
attitudes
of
their
children
and
create
a
home
environment
with
the
tools
to
ensure
success
for
instance
by
encouraging
and
supporting
academic
achievement
and
providing
guidance
in
making
important
life
decisions
a
high quality
comprehensive
and
well rounded
education
meanwhile
is
essential
in
order
to
ensure
success
in
any
field
of
endeavor
ultimately
family
and
education
both
play
an
important
role
in
shaping
an
individual
s
life
and
paving
the
way
for
success
those
with
access
to
a
loving
and
supportive
home
environment
coupled
with
a
good
education
are
more
likely
to
be
successful
in
their
personal
and
professional
lives
once
said
what
lies
behind
us
and
what
lies
before
us
are
tiny
matters
compared
to
what
lies
within
us
s
words
provide
the
backbone
to
the
idea
that
mastering
something
important
is
essential
in
order
to
succeed
in
life
oftentimes
it
can
be
overwhelming
by
the
amount
of
advice
one
may
receive
from
friends
family
and
colleagues
in
regards
to
what
direction
life
should
take
instead
of
focusing
on
someone
else
s
opinion
it
is
important
to
focus
on
one
s
true
passions
and
dreams
success
can
be
achieved
by
pursuing
something
that
sparks
joy
take
for
example
the
success
story
of
founder
of
who
pursued
his
passion
in
computer
science
and
declined
a
lucrative
job
at
he
followed
his
dream
and
his
success
is
now
admired
by
people
all
around
the
world
as
the
saying
goes
dream
doesn
t
become
reality
through
magic
it
takes
sweat
determination
and
hard
work
some
people
may
try
to
bring
us
down
and
discourage
us
from
pursuing
our
dreams
negative
people
will
likely
stand
in
our
way
and
with
the
right
amount
of
resilience
and
focus
it
is
possible
to
push
past
the
doubts
and
move
forward
though
unsolicited
advice
is
often
difficult
to
process
it
is
important
to
remember
to
take
something
away
from
it
that
is
valuable
constructive
criticism
can
be
used
to
help
one
reach
their
goals
not
all
advice
will
be
of
use
but
when
taken
with
an
open
heart
it
can
help
foster
optimistic
mindsets
and
create
an
attitude
of
resilience
in
the
face
of
obstacles
it
is
also
known
that
positive
words
have
a
powerful
impact
on
people
whether
it
is
something
said
in
a
role model
movie
quote
or
from
a
stranger
even
the
slightest
remark
can
greatly
affect
someone
s
perception
of
success
little
words
of
encouragement
can
act
as
boosters
to
get
one
back
to
their
feet
and
back
on
track
ultimately
what
matters
most
is
to
pursure
one
s
own
dreams
and
find
a
way
to
make
them
a
reality
when
considering
whether
students
should
work
in
schools
or
their
homes
many
factors
must
be
taken
into
consideration
interactions
academic
improvement
and
peer
support
are
the
main
choices
that
need
to
be
weighed
in
this
decision
when
students
work
in
a
school
setting
they
benefit
from
frequent
social
interactions
and
the
varied
perspectives
of
their
classmates
they
can
utilize
their
differences
to
collaborate
closely
on
projects
which
can
in
turn
lead
to
better
academic
performance
at
the
same
time
they
can
build
relationships
with
peers
and
have
support
from
each
other
in
a
positive
and
safe
environment
however
working
from
home
has
its
own
set
of
benefits
students
are
able
to
work
in
a
comfortable
and
distraction free
environment
this
can
be
particularly
beneficial
for
students
who
are
more
independent
and
self motivated
and
need
less
guidance
at
the
same
time
students
can
maintain
contact
with
their
peers
and
teachers
online
through
video
conferencing
to
ensure
they
do
not
miss
out
on
the
social
connections
while
also
avoiding
potential
problems
of
in person
interaction
ultimately
the
decision
as
to
whether
students
should
work
in
schools
or
their
homes
depends
on
many
factors
and
must
be
made
on
an
individual
basis
both
options
offer
advantages
and
it
is
important
to
assess
a
student
s
particular
needs
and
their
preferences
before
making
a
decision
in
the
states
limited
human
contact
due
to
technology
has
had
many
positive
effects
on
our
lives
has
given
elderly
people
more
opportunities
to
remain
healthy
and
connected
with
others
while
providing
a
safe
space
to
discuss
important
topics
that
may
have
been
difficult
to
discuss
before
in
person
similarly
technology
has
benefited
less
academically oriented
learners
by
providing
easier
and
more
convenient
ways
to
learn
on
a
larger
scale
technology
has
successfully
saved
lives
contributing
to
a
more
equal
learning
environment
and
has
had
an
overall
positive
impact
on
society
s
well being
traits
shape
a
person
s
identity
and
define
their
path
through
life
they
can
be
shaped
and
developed
by
both
internal
and
external
aspects
such
as
family
the
environment
and
society
through
developing
one
s
traits
an
individual
can
meet
their
goals
an
exploration
of
whether
something
so
intrinsic
can
be
managed
or
if
it
is
partially
influenced
by
external
forces
is
essential
take
for
instance
the
essay
of
a
student
aspiring
for
a
scholarship
the
student
s
determination
passion
and
hard
work
were
key
elements
in
their
efforts
to
fulfill
their
goal
while
each
of
these
aspects
were
shaped
by
the
student
s
internal
drive
their
growth
would
not
have
been
possible
without
the
support
of
the
environment
this
example
highlights
how
character
traits
can
be
an
indicator
of
one
s
character
and
how
that
character
develops
over
time
traits
can
never
be
fully
controlled
since
they
are
a
part
of
our
nature
an
individual
s
character
traits
form
a
unique
identity
that
shapes
their
path
in
life
it
is
essential
to
study
how
these
traits
develop
over
time
examining
the
effects
of
the
environment
society
and
internal
factors
while
understanding
the
notion
that
the
ultimate
control
an
individual
holds
over
their
character
traits
is
limited
learning
or
homeschooling
is
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
students
of
all
ages
although
it
offers
many
advantages
such
as
flexibility
and
reduced
stress
levels
there
are
some
key
disadvantages
to
consider
such
as
a
lack
of
social
interaction
and
increased
distractions
it
s
important
to
understand
the
potential
effects
of
distance
learning
on
a
student
s
mental
health
and
grades
as
research
has
shown
that
these
can
be
significantly
impacted
by
their
learning
environment
and
resources
for
example
students
who
lack
social
connections
and
access
to
sufficient
resources
may
struggle
with
focusing
and
staying
motivated
ultimately
when
deciding
between
distance
learning
and
attending
a
public
or
private
school
it
s
important
to
take
into
account
not
only
the
potential
benefits
but
also
the
potential
disadvantages
of
each
option
asking
for
and
receiving
opinions
from
others
can
be
a
difficult
endeavor
but
when
done
with
the
right
mindset
it
can
provide
invaluable
insight
and
significant
benefits
for
finding
solutions
to
problems
or
making
important
decisions
by
listening
to
varying
perspectives
we
can
open
ourselves
up
to
new
ideas
and
ways
of
thinking
ultimately
leading
to
improved
outcomes
one
of
the
biggest
obstacles
to
asking
for
or
giving
opinions
is
fear
it
can
be
nerve wracking
to
approach
people
and
open
up
to
criticism
but
taking
a
measured
and
prepared
approach
can
help
ease
some
of
those
worries
start
by
thinking
through
what
you
want
to
say
beforehand
and
practice
conveying
your
thoughts
in
an
organized
and
concise
manner
this
will
help
ensure
that
your
opinion
is
thoughtful
and
well received
having
the
ability
to
effectively
communicate
is
an
important
skill
and
it
goes
beyond
simply
asking
for
and
receiving
opinions
it
involves
being
able
to
identify
valuable
feedback
and
sift
through
information
to
draw
meaningful
conclusions
once
this
is
achieved
it
will
be
easier
to
come
to
an
informed
decision
based
on
a
variety
of
sources
the
process
of
gathering
opinions
and
feedback
from
others
can
be
a
tricky
one
but
the
rewards
are
great
and
the
benefits
can
be
seen
in
many
areas
of
life
by
taking
the
time
to
ask
for
and
receive
opinions
we
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
situation
at
hand
and
come
to
a
more
informed
decision
we
can
also
become
better
communicators
better
listeners
and
better
people
overall
the
idea
of
a
four day
school
week
has
been
gaining
traction
among
many
school
districts
recently
the
idea
is
that
by
condensing
the
school
week
into
four
days
and
increasing
the
amount
of
time
spent
at
school
during
those
days
the
amount
of
time
each
student
has
to
complete
their
schoolwork
is
increased
however
there
can
be
major
disadvantages
associated
with
this
schedule
the
main
issue
with
the
four day
school
week
is
the
length
of
the
school
day
with
two
additional
hours
of
school
student
fatigue
and
stress
build
up
more
quickly
than
before
this
can
detract
from
the
quality
of
student
learning
in
the
long
run
longer
school
day
also
has
the
potential
to
affect
our
students
health
some
have
argued
that
these
additional
two
hours
of
school
could
lead
to
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
headaches
and
difficulty
sleeping
in
addition
this
schedule
does
not
allow
for
flexibility
in
learning
some
students
may
have
difficulty
handling
different
areas
of
the
curriculum
while
there
is
potential
for
more
in depth
learning
some
students
may
not
be
able
to
keep
up
with
the
extended
school
day
furthermore
after school
activities
and
extracurriculars
would
be
more
difficult
to
manage
with
a
four day
school
week
finally
it
s
important
to
consider
the
practical
side
of
the
four day
school
week
routes
need
to
be
adjusted
and
many
school
staff
such
as
custodians
and
cafeteria
workers
may
not
have
jobs
available
every
day
due
to
the
school
closures
on
this
presents
a
problem
for
lower
income
and
tax dependent
schools
a
four day
school
week
with
two
additional
hours
of
school
can
have
many
disadvantages
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
while
it
may
be
beneficial
in
certain
cases
there
are
potential
problems
that
must
be
considered
before
implementing
such
a
system
more
and
more
businesses
are
beginning
to
embrace
the
idea
of
a
four day
workweek
by
reducing
the
number
of
days
worked
each
week
to
four
employees
have
more
days
off
leading
to
lower
stress
levels
increased
motivation
and
fresh
energy
for
the
days
worked
this
can
also
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
environment
and
can
help

finally
the

when

about

it

impression
are
all
critical
elements
when

age
taking
classes
from
home
can
be
an
advantageous
and
time saving
experience
for
students
during
these
unique
times
but
it
does
have
its
drawbacks
from
the
perspective
of
those
who

the

benefit
is
the
flexibility
it

can
do

at

and
automatically
save
from

can
also
save

first
impressions
are
often
incredibly
influential
when
forming
opinions
of
one
another
a
person
s
looks
personality
and
communication
skills
all
play
major
role
in
how
we
perceive
them
initially
take
for
example
two
people
you
meet
at
a
party
is
dressed
very
sharply
and
has
excellent
public
speaking
skills
alluding
to
confidence
and
intelligence
on
the
other
hand
is
wearing
more
casual
clothing
and
is
more
reserved
in
his
speech
most
people
would
form
an
initial
impression
of
person
as
professional
while
person
might
be
seen
as
more
casual
and
laid back
however
this
initial
impression
does
n t
always
tell
the
full
story
and
it
s
possible
that
person
may
actually
be
more
competent
over
time
a
person
s
attitude
values
and
sense
of
humor
for
example
can
only
be
truly
observed
over
a
longer
period
of
time
there
are
several
ways
to
improve
your
first
impression
when
it
comes
to
a
person
s
physical
appearance
paying
attention
to
details
such
as
clothing
postures
and
facial
expressions
can
go
a
long
way
in
developing
trust
developing
communication
skills
such
as
the
ability
to
ask
meaningful
questions
and
make
meaningful
conversation
can
also
be
incredibly
beneficial
building
a
strong
sense
of
presence
by
making
eye
contact
and
conveying
confidence
in
one
s
words
and
body
language
are
also
essential
finally
engaging
in
positive
conversations
with
those
you
meet
and
actively
listening
to
their
ideas
can
help
establish
a
positive
initial
impression
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
could
provide
students
with
several
potential
benefits
on
the
academic
front
this
would
likely
lead
to
a
more
advanced
curriculum
where
students
can
cover
more
material
in
the
span
of
three
years
as
opposed
to
four
furthermore
students
may
be
better
prepared
for
college
given
the
exposure
to
more
challenging
classes
and
the
chance
to
complete
appropriate
coursework
earlier
this
option
could
also
benefit
students
extracurricular
activities
with
an
accelerated
timeline
students
could
move
on
to
college
a
year
earlier
than
their
peers
freeing
up
time
to
partake
in
more
campus
activities
or
take
on
a
summer
internship
those
who
decide
to
save
money
by
enrolling
in
a
less
expensive
college
for
this
fourth
year
could
use
this
time
to
take
more
classes
or
get
work
experience
however
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
could
also
have
a
negative
impact
on
student
life
without
an
additional
year
of
high
school
students
may
miss
out
on
some
of
the
traditional
experiences
such
as
playing
sports
or
attending
school
dances
additionally
those
who
are
unsure
of
their
post high
school
plans
may
not
have
enough
time
to
research
their
options
or
gain
sufficient
familiarity
with
the
college
application

has
unique
passions

and
dreams

can
be
difficult

pursue

of
the
most
famous
entrepreneurs
of
all time
both
individuals
followed
their
instinct
and
pursued
what
they
were

their
passion
turned
into
ambition
which
allowed
them
to
eventually
revolutionize

her
success
by

honest
songs

music
was
meant
to
represent
she
ended
up
becoming
one
of
the
most
successful
musicians
of
all time
from
these
examples
it
is
clear
that
the
ability
to
be
yourself
can
lead
to
great
accomplishments
these
examples
show
that
by
understanding
your
truest
passions
and
aspirations
and
believing
in
them
wholeheartedly
you
can

working
in
groups
has
a
range
of
benefits
compared
to
working
alone
collaborative
efforts
have
the
advantage
of
combining
a
variety
of
perspectives
when
it
comes
to
tackling
an
issue
two
or
more
people
working
together
can
provide
different
perspectives
than
a
single
individual

makes
it
easier
to
come
up
with
creative
solutions

atmosphere
towards
achieving
the
goal
additionally
groups
can
provide
helpful
and
constructive
feedback
to
its
members
which
can
help
refine
ideas
and
identify
potential
weaknesses
from
my
own
experience
working
in
groups
can
be
incredibly
advantageous
work
has
enabled
me
to
learn
from
the
collective
knowledge
of
my
peers
and
allowed
me
to
develop
my
capacity
for
collaboration
and
communication
i
was
able
to
use
group
based
activities
to
develop
proficiency
in
problem
solving
and
negotiation
essential
skills
in
the
real
world
ultimately
working
in
groups
has
many
advantages
compared
to
working
alone

is
an
efficient
way
of
working
and
allows
people
to
benefit
from
different
perspectives

work
can
foster
strong
teamwork
skills
communication
and
problem
solving
skills
all
of
which
are
necessary
out
in
the
real
world
for
these
reasons
group
work
should
be
considered
as
a
preferable
method
of
working
i
have
personally
experienced
the
empowerment
that
comes
from
rising
to
the
challenge
of
something
i
have
never
done
before
i
once
set
a
goal
of
running
a
half
marathon
a
goal
that
seemed
lofty
and
daunting
given
that
i
was
a
beginner
runner
in
order
to
meet
this
goal
i
had
to
commit
to
regular
running
and
to
gradually
increase
the
duration
and
intensity
of
my
runs
with
persistence
i
was
able
to
achieve
my
goal
and
even
surpass
it
i
discovered
a
huge
sense
of
satisfaction
and
accomplishment
from
pushing
myself
beyond
my
physical
and
mental
limitations
alternatively
i
witnessed
the
opposite
situation
when
someone
i
knew
set
a
goal
that
they
were
unable
to
reach
despite
their
initial
enthusiasm
for
their
goal
they
eventually
lacked
the
confidence
and
perseverance
to
stay
committed
to
the
goal
they
felt
a
sense
of
failure
and
disappointment
quite
keenly
and
i
could
see
how
this
had
the
potential
to
discourage
them
from
doing
things
that
were
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
s
quote
unless
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
is
highly
applicable
here
although
growing
requires
a
degree
of
risk
and
vulnerability
it
is
those
who
take
such
risks
and
step
outside
of
their
comfort
zones
who
find
the
greatest
rewards
online
classes
offer
students
the
flexibility
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
or
wherever
else
they
might
choose
to
work
they
provide
access
to
educational
content
from
all
over
the
world
and
can
serve
as
an
effective
supplement
to
in person
classes
in
some
cases
they
may
even
provide
a
structural
advantage
over
traditional
class
settings
as
students
can
learn
at
their
own
pace
and
from
different
teachers
however
online
classes
also
present
certain
drawbacks
interaction
between
teachers
and
students
can
often
be
limited
and
this
can
make
it
difficult
to
develop
a
meaningful
relationship
or
understand
complex
concepts
additionally
the
lack
of
in person
guidance
can
make
accountability
more
difficult
for
students
and
make
it
more
likely
that
they
ll
struggle
to
stay
organized
overall
online
classes
offer
great
potential
to
supplement
student
learning
but
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
full
alternative
to
physical
classes
with
a
combination
of
interactive
material
and
virtual
classrooms
they
can
help
to
engage
students
and
provide
a
unique
learning
experience
i
agree
with
s
sentiment
that
it
is
important
to
stay
active
to
make
the
most
of
life
being
idle
will
lead
to
missed
opportunities
because
it
removes
momentum
and
the
opportunity
for
growth
for
example
a
student
who
constantly
stops
studying
and
procrastinates
will
miss
out
on
having
a
better
alternatively
a
person
who
remains
more
actively
involved
in
work
relationships
and
hobbies
will
be
better
set
up
for
success
similarly
a
business
who
is
constantly
expanding
and
taking
fiscal
risks
is
more
likely
to
succeed
than
the
company
who
takes
the
approach
of
doing
nothing
and
waiting
for
the
market
to
change
in
all
it
is
clear
that
the
rewards
gained
from
staying
active
far
outweigh
the
costs
of
being
idle
in
recent
years
has
begun
offering
a
three year
graduation
program
to
its
students
this
rapid
path
to
graduation
enables
students
to
save
time
money
and
graduate
earlier
than
if
they
had
followed
the
traditional
four year
graduation
path
but
what
are
the
pros
and
cons
of
such
a
program
and
how
does
it
affect
the
broader
student
body
the
primary
advantage
of
the
three year
graduation
program
is
that
it
can
enable
certain
students
to
save
money
time
and
graduate
earlier
than
usual
by
compressing
the
traditional
four
years
into
three
students
can
take
the
same
courses
to
obtain
a
degree
but
faster
this
could
be
especially
advantageous
for
students
who
are
paying
their
tuition
on
their
own
or
who
have
already
found
a
career
path
and
would
like
to
pursue
it
as
soon
as
possible
however
this
program
could
also
have
some
downsides
that
must
be
considered
with
less
time
to
experiment
with
courses
students
may
end
up
deciding
on
an
academic
path
ahead
of
time
without
the
possibility
of
changing
their
mind
additionally
the
three year
program
could
make
it
harder
for
students
to
receive
aid
from
scholarships
and
grants
this
rapid path
to
graduation
may
also
easier
for
students
to
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
coursework
they
need
to
complete
in
a
compressed
time frame
when
it
comes
to
its
impact
on
the
broader
student
body
the
three year
graduation
program
could
create
a
situation
of
inequity
between
those
who
can
and
can
not
take
advantage
of
the
program
additionally
it
could
create
a
situation
of
overcrowding
in
certain
college
courses
due
to
the
larger
number
of
students
taking
the
same
course
in
one
given
semester
the
three year
graduation
program
offered
by
certainly
has
a
number
of
pros
and
cons
and
can
have
considerable
impacts
on
student
body
therefore
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
before
deciding
if
this
program
is
suitable
for
each
individual
student
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
the
traditional
four
could
be
a
game
changer
for
students
one
of
the
greatest
potential
advantages
of
graduating
one
year
earlier
is
the
ability
to
start
an
exciting
career
path
a
year
earlier
for
students
interested
in
a
technical
or
professional
field
being
able
to
jump start
their
education
and
begin
working
towards
their
dream
career
a
year
earlier
can
open
many
doors
in
a
much
shorter
amount
of
time
another
potential
advantage
of
graduating
almost
a
year
sooner
is
the
potential
for
financial
freedom
by
finishing
school
early
and
entering
the
job
market
earlier
students
have
the
potential
to
make
more
money
each
year
thus
allowing
them
to
save
more
and
support
their
family
sooner
while
leading
a
more
comfortable
financial
life
this
can
reduce
the
amount
of
debt
students
need
to
accumulate
and
potentially
decrease
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
pay
off
any
debt
an
earlier
graduation
date
also
has
the
potential
to
give
students
more
time
to
dedicate
to
their
family
students
graduating
early
are
able
to
have
more
free
time
to
return
to
their
home
town
and
spend
quality
time
with
their
family
and
loved
ones
and
help
build
stronger
emotional
connections
with
their
roots
graduating
sooner
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
travel
home
more
often
and
strengthen
those
connections
in
a
much
shorter
amount
of
time
in
conclusion
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
the
traditional
four
can
open
many
doors
for
students
in
terms
of
career
family
and
financial
freedom
therefore
it
is
beneficial
for
high
school
students
to
take
this
opportunity
and
accelerate
their
education
to
be
able
to
benefit
from
these
potential
advantages
one
need
not
look
very
far
to
find
proof
of
the
concept
that
growth
can
only
happen
if
one
is
willing
to
step
out
of
their
comfort
zone
and
try
something
new
and
challenging
take
for
instance
the
story
of
a
successful
web developer
who
had
been
working
in
the
same
position
for
the
past
five
years
despite
his
happiness
in
his
job
and
consistent
success
he
felt
a
nagging
feeling
that
he
wanted
to
try
something
different
so
he
decided
to
take
a
risk
and
enrolled
in
a
course
in
web design
something
which
he
had
never
tried
before
though
the
course
was
challenging
and
he
had
to
put
in
a
lot
of
extra
effort
he
eventually
found
success
and
was
able
to
switch
to
a
new
career
working
in
web design
the
potential
risk
associated
with
trying
something
new
is
failure
and
disappointment
the
potential
reward
of
trying
something
outside
of
one
s
comfort
zone
is
the
satisfaction
of
having
gained
new
knowledge
and
experiences
ultimately
leading
to
greater
happiness
and
success
the
statement
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
in
life
is
certainly
true at
least
for
first
impressions
are
difficult
to
shake
but
not
impossible
everyone
has
had
experiences
where
their
first
impression
of
someone
has
changed
over
time
for
instance
when
i
first
met
my
manager
at
work
i
was
unsure
of
how
she
would
react
to
my
ideas
she
seemed
distant
and
i
was
hesitant
to
voice
my
thoughts
over
time
however
i
got
to
know
her
better
and
she
opened
up
to
me
i
eventually
learnt
that
her
distant
demeanor
was
only
her
way
of
being
professional
now
i
respect
her
as
someone
who
values
hard
work
another
example
of
how
my
initial
impression
of
someone
had
changed
was
when
i
met
my
best
friend
at
first
i
thought
she
was
too
judgemental
and
was
wary
of
making
friends
with
her
however
as
i
got
to
know
her
better
i
began
to
appreciate
her
for
her
honest
and
direct
personality
now
she
is
one
of
my
closest
friends
how
someone
s
actions
can
affect
their
first
impression
can
not
be
denied
if
we
can
take
the
time
to
get
to
know
someone
better
we
may
be
able
to
look
beyond
their
initial
impressions
and
see
the
person
they
truly
are
online
classes
can
offer
a
unique
learning
opportunity
for
students
with
special
needs
those
who
speak
different
languages
and
those
who
have
difficulty
adjusting
to
the
school
environment
for
students
with
special
needs
enrolling
in
an
online
class
can
provide
them
with
the
necessary
tools
and
individualized
guidance
to
be
successful
in
their
educational
endeavors
by
removing
the
physical
barriers
of
attending
a
traditional
school
participating
in
an
online
course
gives
these
students
the
confidence
and
independence
to
succeed
despite
any
special
needs
for
non native
language
students
taking
an
online
course
can
be
a
great
way
to
deepen
their
understanding
of
a
language
or
start
from
scratch
by
working
in
an
online
environment
students
can
actively
engage
in
language
acquisition
in
their
own
pace
and
in
a
structured
manner
they
can
connect
with
tutors
or
other
language
learners
from
around
the
world
and
the
digital
resources
available
to
them
extend
far
past
their
traditional
classroom
some
students
might
have
difficulty
adjusting
to
the
traditional
school
environment
but
in
a
digital
classroom
they
can
be
safe
and
comfortable
working
in
online
courses
can
provide
more
time
for
students
to
reflect
and
communicate
their
ideas
and
the
tools
available
to
them
expand
their
learning
opportunities
overall
online
classes
have
the
potential
to
support
students
with
special
needs
those
who
speak
different
languages
and
those
who
have
difficulty
adjusting
to
traditional
school
environment
and
it
is
important
to
take
these
advantages
into
consideration
when
considering
our
education
options
high
school
students
face
the
important
challenge
of
selecting
and
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
help
students
understand
the
importance
of
committing
to
a
career
by
providing
hands on
job
activities
and
internships
as
well
as
career
guidance
committing
to
a
career
helps
students
prepare
for
their
adult
life
by
promoting
a
sense
of
purpose
identity
and
structure
setting
specific
goals
within
their
chosen
career
and
metrics
to
measure
progress
can
help
students
stay
focused
on
their
chosen
path
it
is
also
important
to
give
students
enough
time
to
consider
different
career
options
and
make
an
ideal
career
choice
taking
the
time
to
research
opportunities
rediscover
personal
talents
and
passions
and
exploring
potential
paths
can
be
of
great
benefit
in
the
long
run
as
the
warmer
weather
months
approach
it
s
time
to
start
thinking
about
ways
to
spend
time
outdoors
and
make
the
most
of
it
one
great
activity
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
people
of
all
ages
is
going
for
a
walk
or
jog
this
can
be
particularly
enjoyable
for
pet
owners
who
can
bring
their
fur babies
with
them
and
enjoy
some
quality
time
shared
together
if
you
re
more
of
a
social
butterfly
a
picnic
with
friends
or
family
in
the
park
provides
a
great
opportunity
to
kick
back
relax
and
catch
up
lastly
for
those
who
crave
some
intellectual
stimulation
why
not
take
a
novel
out
by
the
shore
or
a
cozy
garden
bench
sit
back
and
get
lost
in
the
story
all
of
these
activities
have
the
potential
to
be
an
enjoyable
and
fulfilling
way
to
spend
time
outdoors
one
of
the
key
benefits
of
getting
advice
from
multiple
people
before
making
a
decision
is
that
you
can
get
a
broader
range
of
perspectives
hearing
different
ideas
and
opinions
can
help
you
gain
new
insights
and
ideas
which
you
may
not
have
thought
of
before
it
can
also
help
you
make
a
more
informed
decision
as
each
person
may
have
different
experiences
that
you
can
draw
on
getting
multiple
people
s
perspectives
can
also
offer
valuable
feedback
which
can
help
you
identify
any
potential
issues
that
you
might
not
have
considered
before
taking
all
this
into
account
can
help
you
make
a
more
well rounded
decision
that
takes
into
account
a
variety
of
perspectives
high
school
students
should
not
be
required
to
take
music
art
and
drama
classes
because
these
subjects
are
often
seen
as
secondary
branches
of
a
student
s
educational
career
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
importance
of
these
subjects students
should
have
the
opportunity
to
explore
their
creative
passions but
for
many
students
their
primary
focus
is
on
more
academic
classes
in
order
to
make
room
for
these
subjects
students
need
to
sacrifice
other
classes
such
as
math
science
and
language
which
are
essential
for
preparing
students
for
college
by
not
requiring
these
creative
classes
students
can
dedicate
more
time
to
the
core
subjects
that
are
necessary
for
succeeding
in
the
long
term
furthermore
the
benefit
of
enrolling
in
music
art
and
drama
classes
is
largely
individual
while
some
students
may
gain
tremendous
value
from
these
classes
others
may
not
find
the
same
utility
in
them
this
makes
it
difficult
to
justify
a
blanket
requirement
across
the
entire
student
body
as
it
would
not
be
a
beneficial
use
of
time
for
everyone
if
the
classes
are
optional
students
can
choose
to
take
them
if
they
think
it
suits
their
individual
interests
and
teachers
are
able
to
create
classes
tailored
to
their
students
needs
in
conclusion
music
art
and
drama
classes
should
not
be
required
for
high
school
students
this
would
ensure
that
students
have
the
freedom
to
choose
the
classes
that
are
best
suited
to
their
individual
interests
and
make
room
for
the
academic
classes
that
are
essential
for
college
preparation
working
independently
and
in
a
group
both
have
their
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
when
it
comes
to
learning
working
independently
often
leads
to
more
complete
understanding
and
mastery
of
a
certain
task
since
the
individual
is
able
to
focus
on
their
own
learning
process
without
the
distraction
of
having
to
consider
others
however
in
a
group
setting
learning
can
be
enhanced
due
to
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
the
faster
completion
of
tasks
when
it
comes
to
productivity
working
independently
can
be
more
efficient
as
there
is
less
risk
of
distraction
and
peers
getting
lost
on
unrelated
tasks
on
the
other
hand
in
group
settings
people
can
collaborate
and
provide
each
other
with
support
that
can
lead
to
increased
creativity
and
productivity
in
terms
of
communication
and
accuracy
working
independently
can
lead
to
a
more
accurate
and
detailed
work
as
the
individual
has
full
control
of
what
is
being
done
and
can
give
sharp
attention
to
the
specific
details
on
the
other
hand
working
in
a
group
enables
team
members
to
communicate
and
discuss
any
discrepancies
which
lead
to
more
accurate
solutions
ultimately
i
believe
that
while
both
working
independently
and
in
a
group
can
be
effective
depending
on
one
s
goals
and
objectives
working
in
a
group
setting
can
prove
to
be
more
effective
and
productive
the
exchange
of
ideas
within
a
group
setting
and
the
collaboration
that
takes
place
can
lead
to
a
more
efficient
outcome
additionally
the
team
members
can
take
advantage
of
each
other
s
skills
to
complete
tasks
better
and
faster
than
they
would
be
able
to
do
alone
the
new
bearded
dragon
owner
had
her
work
cut
out
for
her
she
began
her
research
by
learning
about
the
dietary
lighting
and
temperature
requirements
of
bearded
dragons
and
made
sure
to
obtain
the
most
suitable
housing
for
her
pet
considering
its
size
requirements
she
also
spent
time
understanding
the
social
needs
of
bearded
dragons
their
behavior
and
the
best
insect based
reptile
food
to
provide
for
them
determined
to
be
a
responsible
pet
owner
asked
her
pet
store
and
veterinarian
for
tips
on
handling
and
exercising
her
new
pet
and
devised
a
plan
to
upgrade
its
habitat
as
it
grew
bigger
the
journey
of
being
a
bearded
dragon
owner
was
just
beginning
for
technology
has
had
a
profound
effect
on
people
s
lives
allowing
us
to
do
more
faster
and
with
greater
ease
from
communication
and
transportation
to
the
everyday
chores
associated
with
work
and
home
life
technology
has
helped
to
make
difficult
tasks
easier
and
more
efficient
for
example
technology
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
keep
in
touch
with
family
and
friends
easily
and
quickly
we
are
now
able
to
socialize
with
people
from
all
over
the
world
and
collaborate
on
projects
without
ever
meeting
them
in
person
technology
can
also
help
those
in
difficult
situations
from
surveillance
systems
that
reduce
crime
to
navigate
systems
in
cars
that
can
help
commuters
avoid
traffic
or
unsafe
conditions
additionally
technology
has
made
the
lives
of
students
much
easier
as
well
with
the
help
of
resources
such
as
online
libraries
and
in home
tutoring
services
students
are
able
to
do
research
more
quickly
and
access
information
that
would
not
have
been
accessible
to
them
in
the
past
moreover
since
technology
allows
us
to
complete
our
daily
tasks
without
in person
interaction
students
can
now
complete
their
work
and
assignments
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
overall
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
live
our
lives
making
everyday
tasks
more
efficient
and
convenient
and
providing
us
with
the
resources
to
stay
connected
to
people
from
around
the
world
upon
graduating
high
school
students
are
often
faced
with
many
potential
career
paths
one
of
the
most
popular
post secondary
routes
is
to
go
to
college
to
pursue
further
studies
in
a
given
field
of
interest
this
can
provide
job
opportunities
in
a
variety
of
fields
such
as
accounting
engineering
and
law
the
benefits
to
this
include
the
potential
for
higher
salary
prospects
greater
job
security
and
the
experience
of
pursuing
more
specialized
training
on
the
flip
side
there
is
also
the
financial
commitment
and
technical
aptitude
required
to
complete
some
of
these
courses
alternately
students
can
take
on
an
apprenticeship
in
order
to
receive
on the job
training
in
a
desired
field
this
pathway
provides
the
student
with
the
opportunity
to
gain
hands on
experience
alongside
more
experienced
professionals
and
a
potential
salary
while
doing
so
the
potential
downsides
to
this
approach
are
the
initially
lower
wages
compared
to
those
of
university
graduates
and
some
jobs
in
this
field
may
be
harder
to
secure
and
stability
may
be
lower
in
comparison
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
students
have
access
to
a
variety
of
career
choices
in
order
to
assist
them
in
making
an
informed
decision
should
provide
guidance
to
students
in
order
to
ensure
they
are
educated
on
the
various
job
opportunities
available
to
them
it
is
important
for
students
to
attend
school
in
order
to
gain
a
good
education
which
can
help
them
to
achieve
future
success
with
the
right
combination
of
post secondary
studies
and
on the job
training
students
can
be
encouraged
to
strive
for
a
successful
career
as
human
beings
we
all
face
pressures
from
those
around
us
especially
our
families
it
s
especially
difficult
when
those
around
us
do
n t
necessarily
share
our
vision
for
reaching
our
personal
dreams
family
pressure
can
be
difficult
to
overcome
but
it
s
important
to
stay
true
to
ourselves
and
trust
our
own
judgement
rather
than
change
for
others
throughout
history
there
have
been
many
inspiring
stories
of
people
who
chose
to
stand
up
for
themselves
and
follow
their
dreams
in
the
face
of
peer
or
familial
pressure
whether
it
was
giving
up
a
high paying
job
to
pursue
a
creative
passion
or
risking
serious
cultural
disapproval
to
stay
single
and
pursue
their
own
independence
people
have
been
able
to
show
the
importance
of
standing
up
for
yourself
and
pursuing
your
passions
it
s
important
to
recognize
that
breaking
free
from
external
pressures
is
necessary
for
growth
and
reaching
our
personal
dreams
we
can
learn
from
the
inspiring
stories
of
others
who
have
done
just
that
the
lesson
here
is
to
trust
ourselves
and
be
willing
to
take
risks
pursuing
our
dreams
is
often
not
easy
but
staying
true
to
ourselves
and
making
sure
to
take
care
of
our
better
interests
is
essential
we
must
remember
that
nobody
else
can
determine
our
paths
only
we
can
make
that
decision
deciding
on
a
career
can
be
a
difficult
and
time consuming
process
and
for
students
in
high
school
it
presents
a
unique
challenge
on
one
hand
making
career
decisions
in
high
school
can
be
beneficial
for
students
who
already
have
a
specific
interest
or
goal
in
mind
high
school
provides
ample
opportunities
to
explore
potential
career
paths
and
test
out
different
areas
of
interest
on
the
other
hand
requiring
students
to
pick
a
career
right
when
they
enter
high
school
can
be
detrimental
to
their
development
it
can
be
stressful
for
students
who
don
t
have
the
resources
to
effectively
explore
their
options
and
who
lack
adequate
information
to
make
a
meaningful
decision
various
methods
can
help
students
make
career
decisions
without
inciting
too
much
stress
for
instance
school
counselors
and
advisors
can
provide
guidance
and
advice
throughout
the
decision making
process
additionally
creating
internships
and
mentorship
programs
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
gain
real world
experience
and
exposure
to
different
career
possibilities
finally
leveraging
the
perspectives
of
friends
family
and
professionals
can
give
students
a
better
understanding
of
the
pros
and
cons
of
different
career
paths
the
old
adage
if
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
grow
holds
true
in
life
if
we
are
static
in
our
knowledge
and
in
our
experiences
we
risk
not
developing
our
full
potential
taking
on
something
that
is
beyond
our
current
level
of
expertise
stretches
us
and
encourages
us
to
develop
better
skills
and
learn
more
about
the
topic
it
is
from
these
out of the box
pursuits
that
we
have
the
capability
to
achieve
greater
levels
of
growth
for
example
a
professional
tennis
player
might
be
considered
to
have
already
mastered
the
game
of
tennis
but
if
this
player
takes
on
a
new
development
challenge
by
trying
a
different
type
of
shot
or
by
changing
his
or
her
grip
in
order
to
improve
the
growth
potential
is
immense
similarly
a
mathematician
who
has
already
earned
a
degree
can
grow
further
by
taking
on
a
more
challenging
problem
or
exploring
a
new
area
of
mathematics
comes
from
pushing
ourselves
to
explore
our
capabilities
beyond
what
we
currently
know
we
often
become
complacent
when
we
feel
we
have
mastered
something
and
this
can
halt
our
development
but
when
we
push
past
our
comfort
zone
and
try
something
new
our
ability
to
grow
and
expand
our
knowledge
is
limitless
being
independent
is
a
way
for
people
to
be
unshackled
from
the
expectations
and
opinions
of
other
people
and
step
out
from
the
shadows
of
society
being
yourself
is
a
way
for
people
to
think
for
themselves
and
make
their
own
decisions
free
from
outside
influences
people
who
become
independent
by
being
themselves
reflect
their
own
authentic
values
and
beliefs
in
their
decisions
allowing
them
to
become
more
confident
and
in
control
of
their
destiny
the
advantages
of
being
true
to
yourself
and
remaining
independent
in
this
way
can
be
seen
in
areas
such
as
career
decisions
financial
decisions
and
relationships
independent
individuals
have
the
freedom
to
make
decisions
which
will
directly
affect
the
life
they
are
leading
without
any
external
pressure
from
other
people
or
society
depending
on
someone
else
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
repercussions
on
one
hand
it
can
provide
a
strong
support
system
of
guidance
and
perspective
but
on
the
other
hand
it
can
create
an
environment
of
constraints
and
shoulds
for
example
decided
to
become
independent
by
pursuing
a
career
in
web
development
in
doing
so
she
was
able
to
explore
her
talent
for
coding
as
well
as
her
passion
while
feeling
in
control
of
her
own
future
on
the
other
hand
was
encouraged
by
her
family
to
pursue
a
degree
in
but
not
for
her
own
enjoyment
or
interests
here
the
lack
of
independence
meant
that
felt
pressured
to
make
a
decision
which
wasn
t
right
for
her
consequently
leading
to
her
dropping
out
of
school
in
conclusion
becoming
independent
by
being
yourself
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
personal
decisions
bringing
about
more
confidence
and
allowing
you
to
make
better
choices
which
reflect
your
own
values
and
beliefs
however
depending
on
someone
else
can
also
provide
guidance
and
support
if
used
correctly
ultimately
the
decision
of
whether
to
be
independent
or
depend
on
someone
else
should
be
made
mindfully
and
not
due
to
external
pressures
or
expectations
there
is
an
often misheld
belief
that
employees
must
possess
experience
in
order
to
obtain
a
job
and
succeed
however
there
are
many
cases
in
which
individuals
have
been
hired
and
have
achieved
success
without
any
prior
job
experience
there
are
a
few
key
reasons
why
this
is
the
case
of
all
having
on the job
training
can
often
be
an
equally
valuable
asset
to
a
potential
employer
as
experience
itself
there
are
a
variety
of
digital
certifications
and
classes
available
online
that
can
help
new
hires
to
gain
skills
and
knowledge
that
can
be
used
towards
the
job
at
hand
this
means
that
an
employer
may
not
need
to
worry
about
skills
gaps
that
would
need
to
be
filled
with
a
more
experienced
hire
secondly
potential
employers
often
look
for
people
who
have
fresh
perspectives
that
could
potentially
add
value
to
their
team
a
potential
employee
may
not
have
experience
but
they
can
bring
new
insights
and
ideas
that
a
more
experienced
hire
may
not
have
for
a
company
taking
a
risk
and
hiring
a
novice
can
be
a
great
way
to
foster
an
innovative
culture
that
brings
value
finally
employers
may
consider
a
potential
employee
who
has
leadership
or
volunteer
work
experience
instead
of
job
experience
this
type
of
experience
can
demonstrate
that
the
candidate
is
enthusiastic
willing
to
learn
and
has
the
communication
and
teamwork
skills
needed
to
succeed
with
the
position
in
conclusion
although
a
candidate
may
not
have
any
job
experience
this
does
not
mean
that
they
can
not
obtain
a
job
or
succeed
with
on
the
job
training
fresh
perspectives
and
alternative
experience
a
candidate
can
be
just
as
successful
as
one
with
prior
job
experience
recent
studies
have
proposed
that
shorter
school
weeks
may
provide
benefits
to
students
parents
and
teachers
alike
the
most
popular
of
these
proposals
is
the
four day
school
week
advantages
of
the
four day
school
week
include
the
potential
to
save
money
on
bussing
electricity
and
other
operational
costs
educators
may
also
find
more
time
to
plan
quality
lessons
and
have
additional
days
for
professional
development
students
may
benefit
from
the
extra
days
off
from
school
for
additional
extracurricular
activities
and
for
more
family
time
however
a
four day
school
week
is
also
not
without
its
drawbacks
to
the
longer
school
days
school
times
may
need
to
be
adjusted
to
accommodate
longer
hours
leading
to
impacts
on
transportation
and
after school
activities
also
the
switch
may
adversely
affect
poor
and
special needs
students
who
rely
on
regular
school
schedules
one
potential
solution
to
some
of
the
potential
disadvantages
of
a
four day
school
week
is
implementing
additional
academic
enrichment
activities
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
week
this
additional
day
for
learning
could
potentially
minimize
the
impacts
of
longer
school
days
while
opening
up
additional
opportunities
for
students
to
enhance
their
skills
in
addition
providing
additional
options
for
transportation
and
school
programs
can
help
to
address
potential
impacts
on
poor
and
special needs
students
ultimately
a
four day
school
week
has
the
potential
to
significantly
impact
the
educational
experience
of
students
teachers
and
parents
proponents
argue
that
the
extra
days
outside
of
school
can
allow
for
more
quality
learning
opportunities
while
detractors
argue
that
the
move
would
create
too
much
disruption
to
their
schedules
further
research
is
needed
to
determine
the
implications
of
the
switch
for
those
involved
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
would
cause
a
number
of
problems
for
students
at
many
students
rely
on
after school
activities
to
develop
important
skills
such
as
sports
music
theater
and
other
extracurriculars
with
two
more
hours
of
classes
and
homework
these
activities
would
have
to
be
put
by
the
wayside
in
order
to
have
enough
time
to
complete
the
necessary
course
work
second
student
health
and
safety
could
be
affected
by
the
extended
school
day
going
to
school
for
an
additional
two
hours
means
students
would
not
only
be
awake
and
working
longer
in
order
to
stay
on
top
of
their
workload
but
they
would
also
be
at
increased
risk
of
exhaustion
and
burnout
due
to
the
lack
of
time
for
rest
and
recovery
finally
a
longer
school
day
would
take
away
from
students
precious
time
spent
with
families
and
friends
outside
of
classroom
boundaries
is
essential
for
students
as
it
allows
them
to
relax
explore
their
interests
and
engage
in
meaningful
relationships
for
these
reasons
should
not
extend
the
school
day
by
two
hours
distance
learning
has
created
an
evolution
in
the
way
that
students
attend
classes
in
the
modern
era
while
it
offers
convenience
and
flexibility
it
can
also
be
rife
with
distractions
that
can
affect
a
student
s
academic
performance
games
phones
and
even
a
lack
of
sleep
can
all
take
away
from
the
effectiveness
of
a
distance
learning
student
s
experience
these
types
of
distractions
can
cause
students
to
become
disengaged
leading
to
missed
assignments
and
a
lower
grade
therefore
it
is
important
for
distance
learners
to
establish
routines
to
minimize
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
such
distractions
and
to
ensure
they
get
enough
sleep
with
adequate
routines
in
place
they
can
better
manage
their
distractions
and
focus
on
doing
well
academically
working
in
groups
or
alone
at
school
can
have
many
benefits
and
drawbacks
can
provide
collaboration
and
a
support
system
for
members
to
help
each
other
with
completing
tasks
this
can
lead
to
higher
grades
as
members
can
offer
assistance
and
spot
each
other
s
mistakes
friendships
can
also
develop
from
working
collaboratively
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
allows
for
the
development
of
independent
and
self reliance
skills
as
well
as
time
to
really
devote
to
mastering
a
particular
topic
or
skill
however
it
can
be
hard
to
find
inspiration
and
motivation
when
working
by
oneself
and
grades
may
suffer
due
to
lack
of
peer
review
ultimately
when
it
comes
to
studying
both
working
in
groups
and
working
alone
have
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
can
both
lead
to
academic
success
some
of
life
s
biggest
decisions
must
be
made
without
the
help
of
an
outside
source
or
expert
opinion
following
one
s
instincts
and
ideas
when
making
decisions
can
lead
to
both
positive
and
negative
consequences
and
it
is
essential
to
develop
self reliance
when
making
these
choices
real life
examples
where
following
instincts
have
led
to
successful
outcomes
include
entrepreneurs
who
start
their
own
business
or
a
student
who
pursues
an
area
of
study
that
interests
them
despite
external
discouragement
self reliance
is
a
key
life
skill
which
empowers
individuals
to
make
decisions
without
relying
on
outside
guidance
learning
to
trust
one
s
instincts
allows
us
to
make
decisions
that
reflect
our
own
values
and
personal
journey
at
times
expert
advice
and
outside
counsel
can
be
beneficial
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
no
one
knows
our
own
journey
better
than
ourselves
and
seeking
guidance
from
experts
is
not
always
beneficial
in
summary
developing
self reliance
is
key
to
making
decisions
that
reflect
our
own
values
and
beliefs
while
expert
advice
can
sometimes
be
useful
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
trusting
one
s
instincts
and
ideas
when
making
decisions
can
often
lead
to
successful
outcomes
when
it
comes
to
seeking
success
it
is
often
assumed
that
the
journey
itself
is
what
will
ultimately
determine
if
an
individual
is
successful
or
not
s
quote
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
conveys
the
idea
that
an
individual
s
enthusiasm
and
perseverance
will
be
what
helps
them
learn
from
failure
and
succeed
the
idea
that
failure
can
be
an
aid
in
the
pursuit
of
success
is
one
based
on
the
notion
of
an
individual
using
their
failures
to
fuel
further
growth
and
success
no
one
starts
out
knowing
how
to
achieve
success
instead
they
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
use
them
to
drive
future
decisions
the
process
of
learning
from
failure
can
be
a
long
and
difficult
one
but
the
fact
that
the
individual
is
pushing
past
rejection
and
disappointment
to
continue
to
work
towards
success
should
be
recognized
the
success
of
an
individual
is
not
only
determined
by
the
number
of
successes
they
accumulate
but
also
by
their
willingness
to
try
new
opportunities
even
after
failure
it
is
through
failure
that
an
individual
can
discover
what
works
and
matters
and
have
the
determination
to
move
forward
despite
not
having
the
outcome
they
had
initially
planned
for
ultimately
these
personal
successes
can
lead
to
even
higher
achievements
and
a
greater
chance
of
the
individual
reaching
their
goals
the
truth
of
s
quote
is
that
success
is
not
always
guaranteed
and
failure
is
a
natural
part
of
the
process
rather
than
giving
up
when
faced
with
rejections
and
defeats
an
individual
should
focus
on
trusting
the
process
and
using
every
obstacle
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
with
trials
and
tribulations
and
a
belief
in
oneself
success
can
be
achieved
researching
career
options
can
be
an
overwhelming
task
for
anyone
just
starting
out
with
so
many
paths
to
choose
between
it
is
important
to
evaluate
the
potential
of
each
option
taking
classes
can
help
students
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
any
potential
future
career
field
and
enable
them
to
develop
relevant
skills
while
taking
classes
is
a
great
way
to
prepare
for
a
future
career
it
is
important
to
note
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
this
approach
in
some
cases
taking
classes
can
give
students
an
edge
in
a
competitive
job
market
however
there
is
no
guarantee
that
taking
classes
will
ensure
success
in
a
particular
career
field

it
is
important

differ
in
how
long
they
break
for
summer
in
many
places
the
summer
holidays
can
last
anywhere
from
weeks
while
for
the
rest
of
the
year
there
are
short
breaks
lasting
around
weeks
while
shorter
breaks
may
seem
more
manageable
for
educational
institutions
to
plan
it
s
always
been
argued
that
having
extended
periods
of
summer
break
is
important
for
students
firstly
the
schoolwork
that
many
students
have
to
do
can
be
overwhelming
extended
summer
holidays
give
students
a
much needed
break
from
the
pressures
of
school
and
allow
them
to
recuperate
mentally
this
time
helps
students
to
relax
and
come
back
to
school
feeling
refreshed
enabling
them
to
tackle
their
studies
with
renewed
enthusiasm
during
summer
holidays
students
can
benefit
from
being
exposed
to
new
experiences
which
can
also
encourage
learnings
outside
the
classroom
and
school
walls
for
example
summers
provide
a
great
opportunity
to
travel
allowing
students
to
explore
different
cultures
and
expand
their
horizons
this
will
help
them
to
grow
and
develop
into
well rounded
individuals
moreover
extended
summer
holidays
can
also
allow
students
to
pursue
hobbies
and
interests
that
supplement
what
they
learn
in
school
at
home
students
can
dedicate
time
to
reading
books
working
on
creative
projects
learning
music
or
sports
and
more
this
can
be
done
without
any
rush
or
worry
allowing
students
to
take
the
time
they
need
to
work
on
their
projects
overall
summer
breaks
allow
students
to
take
necessary
time
off
from
the
academic
rigor
and
can
accelerate
learning
in
the
following
year
when
students
are
able
to
tackle
their
studies
with
renewed
motivation
and
perspective
breaks
for
the
rest
of
the
year
provide
mini
breaks
throughout
the
school
year
which
can
be
just
as
beneficial
as
longer
breaks
therefore
it
is
extremely
useful
for
educational
institutions
to
have
extended
periods
of
summer
break
and
shorter
breaks
for
the
rest
of
the
year
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
failure
is
a
stepping
stone
on
the
path
to
success
countless
successful
people
have
experienced
setbacks
and
yet
persevered
towards
their
goals
it
is
this
resilience
recognition
and
acknowledgement
of
one
s
failures
that
helps
to
instill
confidence
and
strength
with
each
failure
comes
the
opportunity
to
learn
to
identify
what
could
have
been
done
differently
and
how
it
might
be
achieved
in
the
future
having
small
successes
along
the
journey
also
helps
to
provide
momentum
success
does
not
have
to
come
in
grandiose
gestures
in
order
to
be
counted
acknowledging
progress
in
small
steps
in
the
right
direction
can
help
to
build
more
confidence
to
eventually
reach
larger
successes
although
mistakes
can
seem
daunting
and
sometimes
a
source
of
shame
it
is
important
to
remember
that
success
is
rarely
achieved
without
failure
it
is
important
to
remember
that
failure
should
not
be
seen
as
a
sign
of
weakness
but
rather
an
opportunity
to
grow
and
learn
it
is
only
with
this
mindset
that
one
can
truly
hone
in
on
what
is
necessary
to
reach
the
ultimate
goal
research
has
shown
that
distance
learning
has
both
its
pros
and
cons
for
student
performance
on
one
hand
it
provides
convenience
and
flexibility
allowing
students
to
attend
classes
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
it
also
eliminates
the
need
to
commute
from
place
to
place
and
can
provide
access
to
courses
and
educational
resources
that
are
otherwise
not
available
in
traditional
settings
on
the
other
hand
distance
learning
has
drawbacks
as
well
without
the
benefit
of
direct
teacher
instruction
students
can
experience
a
lack
of
guidance
and
support
as
well
as
feeling
a
reduction
in
motivation
and
engagement
additionally
online
classes
can
be
more
susceptible
to
cheating
and
plagiarism
due
to
the
anonymity
of
the
environment
although
distance
learning
can
be
beneficial
for
students
it
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
replacement
for
more
traditional
forms
of
education
in person
instruction
provides
a
greater
sense
of
community
as
well
as
increased
collaboration
and
interaction
with
experienced
faculty
traditional
classrooms
can
offer
more
individualized
learning
options
and
provide
access
to
academic
and
social
resources
that
are
not
available
in
an
online
environment
by
understanding
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
both
forms
of
education
students
can
make
more
informed
decisions
about
the
type
of
learning
which
is
best
suited
for
their
individual
needs
and
interests
recently
i
made
the
mistake
of
not
asking
for
help
when
i
needed
it
i
was
trying
to
tackle
a
problem
on
my
own
but
it
was
beyond
my
capabilities
as
a
result
i
wasted
time
and
energy
trying
to
solve
a
complex
problem
with
my
limited
skillset
when
i
eventually
decided
to
ask
for
help
i
was
able
to
learn
from
someone
who
was
more
knowledgeable
than
me
and
get
the
problem
resolved
efficiently
the
biggest
takeaway
from
this
experience
is
that
sometimes
it
s
okay
to
admit
when
you
need
help
and
asking
for
help
is
no
less
of
an
accomplishment
than
solving
the
problem
on
your
own
i
believe
it
s
possible
to
benefit
from
mistakes
even
when
we
make
a
mistake
we
can
still
reflect
and
gain
valuable
knowledge
and
insight
whether
that
s
as
a
result
of
being
more
mindful
of
the
situation
or
by
seeking
guidance
from
someone
else
as
the
proverb
says
failing
to
plan
is
planning
to
fail
it
s
clear
that
taking
the
time
to
reflect
preparing
for
potential
problems
and
regularly
evaluating
our
progress
are
key
components
of
success
and
growth
my
goal
is
to
become
a
successful
entrepreneur
to
achieve
this
i
plan
to
enroll
in
an
entrepreneurship
program
where
i
can
learn
the
necessary
knowledge
skills
and
connections
to
succeed
i
will
also
read
articles
and
books
from
successful
entrepreneurs
like
to
learn
more
about
the
industry
i
am
aware
that
starting
a
business
is
not
an
easy
task
i
will
need
to
have
a
strong
financial
situation
to
back
up
my
business
plans
as
well
as
learn
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
industry
to
overcome
these
obstacles
i
plan
to
save
money
network
with
other
entrepreneurs
and
build
relationships
with
potential
investors
successful
entrepreneurs
have
achieved
great
things
such
as
building
innovative
companies
and
creating
jobs
by
achieving
my
goal
i
can
also
create
positive
change
in
the
world
not
only
will
i
make
a
difference
but
i
will
also
be
able
to
promote
my
own
ideas
and
benefit
from
the
financial
rewards
of
being
a
successful
entrepreneur
working
collaboratively
in
groups
is
an
essential
part
of
life
it
promotes
efficiency
deepens
understanding
and
enhances
relationships
working
in
a
group
has
several
advantages
compared
to
working
alone
in
terms
of
both
productivity
and
understanding
improvies
productivity
because
it
allows
people
to
divide
work
into
manageable
tasks
and
specialize
their
skills
instead
of
one
person
having
to
do
the
whole
task
a
group
can
use
their
collective
skills
and
abilities
to
each
do
their
part
this
saves
time
and
allows
members
to
focus
on
what
they
re
best
at
which
can
result
in
better
work
in
less
time
the
communal
aspect
of
collaboration
promotes
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
task
members
can
bounce
ideas
off
each
other
hearing
multiple
perspectives
and
honing
their
understanding
this
is
especially
true
for
more
complex
projects
as
several
views
help
to
bring
a
clearer
understanding
to
the
topic
working
together
also
improves
relationships
between
group
members
it
encourages
communication
developing
trust
and
strengthening
bonds
these
strong
relationships
foster
an
environment
that
promotes
creative
and
effective
collaboration
in
conclusion
working
in
a
group
setting
has
many
advantages
over
working
alone
can
be
increased
understanding
can
be
deepened
and
relationships
can
be
strengthened
collaboration
should
be
encouraged
whenever
possible
as
it
is
an
important
and
beneficial
component
of
success
two
fantastic
outdoor
activities
that
you
can
do
with
you
family
are
camping
and
biking
is
a
great
way
to
get
away
and
reconnect
with
nature
while
enjoying
quality
time
with
your
loved
ones
you
can
camp
in
the
backyard
go
on
weekend
trips
to
nearby
camping
spots
or
even
take
extended
trips
to
explore
new
terrain
the
main
advantage
of
camping
is
that
it
s
a
relatively
low cost
activity
that
anyone
can
do
regardless
of
age
is
another
great
activity
to
do
with
your
family
allows
you
to
explore
the
great
outdoors
in
a
fun
and
active
way
you
can
ride
along
easy
trails
in
the
city
for
a
leisurely
ride
or
conquer
more
challenging
terrain
outside
the
city
the
main
advantage
of
biking
is
that
it
encourages
physical
activity
and
promotes
healthier
lifestyles
plus
bikes
are
relatively
low cost
and
environmentally
friendly
when
it
comes
to
making
an
informed
commitment
to
a
career
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
value
of
waiting
until
later
in
high
school
the
high
school
years
are
a
critical
time
for
developing
knowledge
and
skills
that
can
impact
long term
career
success
moreover
waiting
to
commit
to
a
path
until
later
in
high
school
can
save
students
from
investing
in
unsuccessful
or
inappropriate
study
practices
taking
time
to
explore
available
career
options
form
study
habits
and
seek
guidance
from
mentors
can
help
students
to
select
an
appropriate
career
track
as
they
enter
adulthood
ineffective
studying
practices
can
lead
to
failure
in
a
chosen
career
but
taking
the
time
to
research
thoroughly
and
develop
effective
methods
will
provide
a
strong
foundation
for
long term
success

i
recognize
that

setting
an
example
is
an
effective
way
to
influence
those
around
us
for
example
the
recent
phenomenon
of
has
demonstrated
the
power
of
setting
an
example
this
trend
has
swept
classrooms
and
has
made
e cigarettes
seem
like
the
norm
in
studies
researchers
have
found
the
direct
correlation
between
seeing
peers
use
e cigarettes
and
developing
the
habit
oneself
similarly
popular
online
challenges
have
been
effective
at
influencing
younger
generations
and
can
be
a
powerful
form
of
setting
an
example
drawing
from
theories
in
evolutionary
psychology
there
are
parallels
to
setting
an
example
and
how
animals
such
as
wolves
act
in
a
pack
a
pack
of
wolves
often
looks
to
one
or
two
members
to
set
an
example
and
guide
them
in
the
same
vein
setting
an
example
can
be
a
powerful
force
for
cognitive
growth
and
social
change
setting
an
example
is
the
best
method
of
influencing
individuals
this
is
because
individuals
are
more
likely
to
assimilate
into
the
groups
and
adopt
behaviors
seen
from
those
in
the
same
social
setting
examples
can
be
very
persuasive
and
prove
that
such
behavior
is
possible
furthermore
when
those
around
us
set
examples
of
excellence
it
often
improves
the
quality
of
the
entire
group
by
pushing
one
another
ever
higher
in
conclusion
setting
an
example
is
an
effective
way
to
gain
influence
within
modern
day
society
whether
it
be
through
trends
such
as
or
through
setting
a
standard
of
excellence
setting
an
example
can
be
an
impactful
way
to
shape
the
thoughts
beliefs
and
behaviors
of
those
around
us
the
introduction
of
a
new
school
requirement
that
all
students
must
participate
in
an
extracurricular
activity
has
far reaching
implications
both
positive
and
negative
on
one
hand
extracurricular
activities
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
explore
their
interests
and
develop
valuable
skills
that
will
benefit
them
in
the
future
on
the
other
hand
the
mandate
may
place
additional
burden
on
already
stressed
and
overbooked
students
ultimately
leading
to
feelings
of
resentment
and
disengagement
in
this
essay
i
will
explore
the
effects
of
a
school
requirement
that
all
students
must
participate
in
an
extracurricular
activity
the
primary
benefit
of
the
mandate
is
increased
engagement
and
motivation
among
students
by
making
extracurricular
activities
mandatory
students
are
given
the
opportunity
to
try
something
new
and
develop
a
passion
that
could
eventually
form
the
basis
of
a
future
career
moreover
it
encourages
students
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
their
peers
resulting
in
enhanced
social
and
emotional
growth
however
it
is
also
important
to
take
into
account
the
potential
drawbacks
of
such
a
requirement
enforcing
the
mandate
can
put
an
additional
strain
on
students
already
faced
with
a
skyrocketing
workload
this
can
lead
to
frustration
and
a
feeling
that
there
is
simply
not
enough
time
or
resources
to
devote
to
the
extracurricular
activity
additionally
students
may
be
pushed
to
participate
in
an
extracurricular
activity
which
they
have
no
genuine
interest
in
ultimately
leading
to
disinterest
and
disengagement
in
conclusion
mandating
extracurricular
activities
could
potentially
offer
students
a
range
of
benefits
yet
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
and
to
ensure
that
all
students
have
the
resources
and
support
they
need
to
succeed
after
extensive
research
into
the
availability
of
internships
and
shadowing
opportunities
in
the
local
area
for
those
interested
in
the
chosen
field
of
study
a
list
of
companies
and
organizations
was
compiled
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
option
were
assessed
in
detail
in
order
to
determine
which
one
would
be
the
best
option
for
someone
interested
in
this
field
taking
into
account
the
range
of
experiences
and
locations
it
was
concluded
that
was
the
most
ideal
as
they
offered
the
most
comprehensive
program
for
learning
networking
and
gaining
valuable
field
experience
we
often
hear
stories
of
famous
individuals
who
experienced
failure
before
they
achieved
success
from
being
cut
from
his
high
school
basketball
team
to
being
rejected
by
publishers
before
the
series
was
accepted
failure
is
an
integral
part
of
success
moreover
research
has
shown
that
failure
can
be
beneficial
to
our
development
it
allows
us
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
persist
in
the
face
of
difficulty
gain
confidence
and
resilience
and
grow
from
the
experience
take
one
of
my
own
experiences
when
i
first
started
my
online
business
i
struggled
to
get
it
off
the
ground
i
faced
a
lot
of
disappointment
and
failure
but
i
persisted
eventually
my
business
found
success
and
it
gave
me
a
newfound
sense
of
confidence
the
moral
of
these
stories
is
clear
everyone
experiences
failure
at
some
point
in
their
life
and
there
s
no
shame
in
it
even
if
it
feels
like
failure
initially
it
can
often
be
a
much
needed
lesson
and
a
stepping
stone
to
success
so
don
t
give
up
keep
trying
and
eventually
you
ll
get
to
where
you
want
to
be
having
grown
up
in
the
age
of
technology
i
have
personally
experienced
both
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
its
use
in
my
day to day
life
in
terms
of
human
contact
technology
has
enabled
us
to
connect
with
friends
and
family
who
are
located
far
away
on
the
flip
side
however
it
has
diminished
face to face
interactions
since
many
of
us
spend
our
free
time
in
front
of
our
screens
rather
than
physically
engaging
with
each
other
when
it
comes
to
health
technology
can
be
a
source
of
both
mental
and
physical
benefits
for
instance
apps
like
provide
guided
meditation
exercises
and
educational
resources
that
help
improve
mental
health
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
variety
of
health
risks
associated
with
technology
such
as
frequent
headaches
and
excessive
strain
on
the
neck
and
shoulders
due
to
the
lack
of
posture
technology
has
also
revolutionized
the
way
we
learn
and
conduct
our
educational
studies
it
has
allowed
us
to
access
vast
amounts
of
knowledge
and
each
other
through
various
online
platforms
such
as
and
while
offering
a
variety
of
multimedia
tools
to
facilitate
the
learning
process
despite
these
advantages
the
rampant
use
of
technology
can
also
promote
distraction
among
students
due
to
its
availability
and
ease
of
access
in
terms
of
leisure
activities
technology
has
been
a
great
asset
when
it
comes
to
entertainment
and
leisure
from
streaming
music
or
playing
video
games
to
exercising
via
fitness
apps
technology
can
connect
people
and
opens
up
possibilities
for
new
creative
experiences
despite
the
potential
it
has
to
open
new
doors
it
can
also
leave
people
feeling
isolated
when
they
become
too
dependent
on
technology
i
use
technology
on
a
daily
basis
as
a
part
of
both
my
work
and
leisure
activities
i
use
it
to
search
for
information
on
the
internet
for
my
school
assignments
communicate
and
stay
connected
with
my
friends
stream
music
and
play
video
games
based
on
my
experiences
i
believe
that
overall
the
use
of
technology
has
had
a
mostly
positive
impact
on
people
while
it
can
lead
to
addiction
and
distraction
in
certain
scenarios
used
responsibly
technology
can
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
to
connect
educate
and
entertain
adding
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
could
have
a
drastic
impact
on
students
ability
to
complete
homework
and
get
enough
sleep
many
students
already
feel
overwhelmed
with
a
full
day
of
classes
and
after school
activities
and
such
a
lengthy
school
day
would
only
exacerbate
that
feeling
furthermore
the
extra
hour
and
a
half
would
undoubtedly
cut
into
the
amount
of
time
students
would
have
to
spend
on
their
homework
homework
time
extracurriculars
and
sleep
something
would
inevitably
have
to
be
cut
from
the
equation
and
most
likely
it
would
be
needed
sleep
to
ensure
that
students
can
continue
to
meet
their
academic
responsibilities
without
sacrificing
important
sleep
it
would
be
beneficial
to
explore
different
alternatives
to
the
extra
hour
and
a
half
for
instance
school
boards
could
consider
offering
extra
periods
or
modules
throughout
the
year
outside
of
the
traditional
school
day
to
give
students
the
opportunity
to
focus
on
their
studies
by
spreading
out
the
extra
hour
and
a
half
rather
than
compressing
it
into
the
regular
school
day
students
could
continue
to
earn
credit
for
classes
while
avoiding
the
potential
pitfalls
of
excessive
school
days

shown
that
when
teenagers
do
not
follow

on
our
relationships
and

environment
around
us
through
creating
a
positive
atmosphere
and
cultivating
positivity
we
can
build
better
relationships
and
spread
happiness
with
those
around
us
first
impressions
may
not
always
be
accurate
because
they
are
based
on
limited
information
that
is
often
incomplete
or
inaccurate
our
brains
are
hardwired
to
make
split second
decisions
about
people
and
situations
so
these
first
impressions
can
be
the
result
of
any
number
of
factors
such
as
socio economic
status
gender
age
or
physical
appearance
to
counteract
this
it
is
important
to
take
a
step
back
and
consider
these
snap
judgments
in
a
larger
context
consider
the
possibility
of
being
open
minded
and
looking
for
evidence
to
support
or
contradict
initial
impressions
additionally
taking
the
time
to
really
get
to
know
someone
can
help
to
form
more
accurate
impressions
that
go
beyond
first
glance
first
impressions
are
a
funny
thing
they
often
stick
with
us
and
have
a
huge
impact
on
how
we
perceive
someone
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
first
impressions
can
be
wrong
and
it
is
not
possible
to
judge
someone
s
character
based
on
the
few
limited
points
of
view
we
have
of
them
early
on
everyone
has
the
right
for
their
character
to
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
and
not
by
a
few
fleeting
moments
first
impressions
are
based
on
a
limited
scope
of
facts
and
can
often
be
heavily
biased
we
may
think
that
a
person
is
unkind
based
on
a
lack
of
politeness
in
an
introduction
but
it
does
not
give
us
a
full
understanding
of
their
true
character
we
may
think
someone
intelligent
based
on
their
manner
of
speaking
in
an
interview
but
that
does
not
tell
us
the
full
range
of
their
knowledge
it
is
only
by
taking
the
time
to
get
to
know
someone
through
meaningful
conversations
spending
quality
time
with
them
and
learning
more
about
their
background
that
we
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
who
they
are
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
we
all
have
the
capacity
to
grow
and
change
over
time
our
beliefs
and
opinions
can
shift
and
it
is
important
to
recognise
this
when
judging
someone
we
must
understand
that
nobody
is
perfect
and
that
we
all
make
mistakes
it
is
only
through
understanding
and
patience
that
can
we
learn
more
about
an
individual
and
their
character
in
conclusion
it
is
impossible
to
judge
someone
based
on
their
first
impressions
we
must
take
the
time
to
get
to
know
someone
properly
and
keep
an
open
mind
if
we
want
to
gain
a
full
understanding
of
their
character
everyone
deserves
the
right
to
be
judged
on
their
own
merits
and
given
a
fair
chance
to
prove
themselves
the
idea
that
problems
both
good
and
bad
can
contribute
to
personal
growth
and
self development
is
an
insightful
and
often
overlooked
concept
on
the
surface
many
of
us
tend
to
view
problems
as
undesirable
and
something
to
be
avoided
we
try
to
take
the
paths
least
cluttered
with
obstacles
and
who
could
blame
us
after
all
who
wants
to
put
themselves
through
the
stress
and
anguish
of
tough
times
that
come
along
with
hard
problems
despite
this
understandable
instinct
problems
of
any
kind
can
be
used
to
our
advantage
good
problems
are
those
that
stretch
our
abilities
and
allow
us
to
develop
new
skills
by
pushing
our
parameters
and
pushing
through
what
we
may
feel
to
be
our
limits
we
open
ourselves
to
a
world
of
possibilities
these
problems
can
lend
to
personal
growth
and
self fulfillment
and
open
us
up
to
possibilities
we
may
not
have
previously
considered
similarly
bad
problems
can
also
be
used
as
a
means
of
learning
and
growing
by
actively
engaging
challenges
and
putting
effort
towards
their
solutions
we
learn
invaluable
lessons
about
ourselves
and
the
world
around
us
we
may
come
to
trust
our
own
resilience
or
perhaps
understand
our
position
in
society
a
bit
better
even
when
the
immediate
outcome
of
solving
a
problem
is
not
what
we
had
originally
hoped
for
the
process
itself
can
produce
insight
into
our
strategies
and
approaches
that
can
be
useful
in
furthering
our
personal
development
both
good
and
bad
problems
are
vital
to
our
journey
of
self discovery
by
embracing
what
may
initially
appear
to
be
unpleasant
tasks
challenges
or
experiences
we
can
use
these
difficulties
to
our
advantage
we
can
choose
to
see
adversity
as
an
opportunity
to
grow
and
become
the
best
version
of
ourselves
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
people
interact
and
communicate
with
each
other
on
one
hand
it
has
allowed
people
to
connect
with
one
another
across
greater
distances
and
in
new
ways
with
the
invention
of
text
messaging
video
calls
and
social
networks
it
is
now
easier
than
ever
for
people
to
remain
in
contact
with
those
they
love
from
wherever
they
may
be
on
the
other
hand
technology
has
also
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
amount
of
physical
contact
that
people
have
with
each
other
with
so
many
different
methods
of
communication
available
many
of
which
are
digital
it
can
be
easy
to
forgo
face to face
contact
with
family
and
friends
this
lack
of
physical
contact
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
our
emotional
wellbeing
and
can
lead
to
feelings
of
isolation
and
loneliness
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
technology
has
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
human
contact
it
has
enabled
us
to
stay
connected
in
new
and
exciting
ways
while
at
the
same
time
leading
some
of
us
to
bypass
the
importance
of
physical
contact
to
make
the
most
out
of
modern
technology
it
is
essential
that
we
place
a
premium
on
physical
communication
as
well
so
that
our
emotional
connections
with
others
can
be
strengthened
one
example
of
an
inspiring
individual
who
has
used
failure
as
a
way
to
become
successful
is
the
entrepreneur
was
famously
fired
from
the
company
he
founded
in
in
he
returned
to
with
a
renewed
sense
of
ambition
and
drive
and
made
the
decisions
which
turned
the
company
around
and
made
it
the
international
success
it
is
today
himself
stated
that
being
fired
from
his
own
company
forced
him
to
push
himself
and
think
differently
than
before
stating
getting
fired
from
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
ever
happened
to
me
the
heaviness
of
being
successful
was
replaced
by
the
lightness
of
being
a
beginner
again
less
sure
about
everything
it
freed
me
to
enter
one
of
the
most
creative
periods
of
my
life
experience
with
failure
ultimately
inspired
him
to
become
even
more
successful
thus
demonstrating
the
beneficial
effects
that
failure
can
have
in
inspiring
people
to
become
successful
when
exploring
the
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
it
is
clear
that
there
are
many
advantages
to
engaging
in
collaborative
work
projects
can
provide
a
diverse
mix
of
ideas
skills
and
perspectives
that
can
enhance
the
output
of
the
task
working
in
a
team
also
allows
for
strong
communication
skills
to
be
honed
which
can
be
beneficial
in
both
an
academic
and
professional
setting
group
work
can
also
be
more
efficient
as
tasks
can
be
delegated
among
team
members
and
achieved
faster
than
working
alone
however
there
are
also
disadvantages
to
working
in
a
team
due
to
conflicting
opinions
or
lack
of
clear
communication
it
is
therefore
important
to
familiarize
oneself
with
successful
techniques
for
group
work
such
as
properly
outlining
the
task
understanding
the
strengths
of
each
group
member
setting
clear
goals
and
creating
guidelines
for
communication
by
following
these
techniques
you
can
ensure
that
the
collaborative
work
experience
is
successful
and
that
the
group
can
achieve
their
shared
goals
one
of
the
biggest
problems
that
students
across
face
is
not
enjoying
the
school
lunch
offered
in
the
cafeteria
many
students
become
unenthused
with
the
same
meals
and
it
affects
their
performance
in
school
after
conducting
research
it
is
evident
that
there
are
several
underlying
reasons
why
students
do
n t
like
school
lunch
firstly
the
quality
and
the
presentation
of
the
food
are
often
subpar
moreover
many
school
cafeterias
lack
variety
and
offer
the
same
selections
of
meals
every
day
causing
students
to
develop
an
aversion
to
the
food
additionally
the
taste
is
often
an
issue
as
the
cafeteria
food
is
usually
not
very
flavorful
and
for
many
students
it
is
not
enjoyable
to
eat
many
students
are
concerned
with
the
nutrition
and
safety
of
the
cafeteria
food
to
make
the
school
cafeteria
more
appealing
to
students
the
first
step
is
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
food
the
menus
should
be
regularly
reviewed
and
changed
to
make
sure
that
there
is
enough
variety
for
the
students
should
also
invest
in
hiring
experienced
chefs
to
provide
meals
that
are
both
nutritious
and
tasty
additionally
schools
should
focus
on
improving
the
presentation
of
the
food
as
this
may
make
them
more
attractive
and
more
appetizing
to
students
schools
should
also
introduce
alternative
options
such
as
healthier
protein
bars
and
smoothies
finally
parents
should
be
actively
involved
in
the
choices
being
made
as
their
input
is
necessary
to
make
the
school
cafeteria
more
appetizing
and
appealing
to
students
staying
active
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
for
our
physical
and
mental
health
as
it
helps
reduce
fatigue
and
stress
while
also
strengthening
the
body
physical
benefits
of
staying
active
include
reduced
risk
of
heart
disease
diabetes
and
stroke
improved
balance
coordination
and
posture
stronger
bones
and
muscles
increased
flexibility
and
improved
aerobic
capacity
additionally
mentally
and
emotionally
staying
active
can
help
reduce
stress
improve
cognitive
function
reduce
anxiety
and
improve
sleep
however
there
are
also
drawbacks
to
staying
active
overexerting
the
body
can
lead
to
overworked
muscles
joint
injuries
fatigue
and
exhaustion
additionally
environmental
and
temperature
extremes
can
exacerbate
physical
health
issues
on
the
other
hand
can
also
be
beneficial
in
the
right
circumstances
depending
on
the
situation
inactivity
can
aid
in
the
healing
of
injuries
such
as
sprains
strains
and
fractures
also
short
periods
of
inactivity
can
help
balance
hormonal
and
metabolic
systems
such
as
improving
focus
during
the
day
or
helping
get
a
restful
night
s
sleep
overall
staying
active
and
inactivity
both
have
benefits
and
drawbacks
and
which
option
is
better
depends
on
the
individual
and
their
specific
needs
for
instance
staying
active
is
recommended
for
physical
health
but
inactivity
will
be
beneficial
for
rest
and
recovery
ultimately
engaging
in
both
physical
activity
and
periods
of
rest
throughout
the
day
can
lead
to
a
healthier
lifestyle

excerpt
high
school
is
often
seen
as
the
launching
point
for
students
to
start
exploring
different
career
paths
without
access
to
career
guides
many
students
feel
at
a
loss
unsure
of
what
they
should
pursue
after
high
school
or
how
they
can
best
prepare
for
their
future
having
a
career
guide
can
be
especially
beneficial
in
helping
students
to
feel
excited
to
come
to
school
and
get
the
most
out
of
their
education
not
only
can
a
career
guide
help
students
explore
and
find
opportunities
that
align
with
their
interests
and
goals
but
they
can
also
provide
guidance
on
cheaper
academic
alternatives
to
college
it
is
important
to
research
how
students
with
and
without
access
to
career
guides
have
experienced
different
outcomes
in
their
lives
and
explore
how
schools
can
give
more
students
the
opportunity
to
pursue
the
careers
they
want
additionally
examining
examples
of
people
who
have
been
successful
despite
limited
access
to
career
guides
can
also
provide
important
insights
into
how
students
can
find
a
successful
career
path
when
faced
with
a
problem
it
is
important
to
remember
that
underestimating
any
issue
regardless
of
size
can
be
detrimental
instead
individuals
should
try
their
best
to
assess
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
proceed
with
a
peaceful
and
positive
approach
for
problems
that
involve
multiple
parties
it
may
be
beneficial
to
utilize
a
mix
of
psychological
strategies
such
as
incorporating
active
communication
active
listening
and
understanding
different
points
of
view
it
is
important
to
remember
that
striving
for
effective
problem solving
often
brings
us
closer
to
finding
the
best
possible
solution
additionally
mistakes
should
not
be
seen
as
shameful
or
embarrassing
but
rather
enable
us
to
gain
valuable
insight
and
understanding
although
some
problems
may
appear
daunting
one
must
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
supportive
people
and
resources
to
turn
to
so
one
is
never
alone
when
it
comes
to
problem solving
the
development
of
technology
and
its
implementation
in
society
has
revolutionized
the
way
humans
live
beginning
in
the
late

began
to
introduce
radical
new
ideas
that
would
change
the

one
of
the
most

by
italian
physicist
and
inventor

of
airwaves
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
legendary
entrepreneurs
such
as
and
paved
the
way
for
the
development
of
electrical
power
introducing
the
concept
to
the
world
this
breakthrough
allowed
for
the
invention
of
other
technologies
we
use
today
such
as
computers
furthermore
inventors
such
as
and
worked
hard
to
create
computers
and
programs
that
could
handle
large
amounts
of
data
and
be
useful
for
everyday
tasks
these
advancements
in
technology
fundamentally
changed
the
way
people
live
their
lives
it
has
allowed
people
to
access
information
from
all
over
the
world
form
meaningful
relationships
and
become
more
productive
in
various
areas
of
life
has
also
enabled
us
to
communicate
with
people
from
across
the
globe
and
even
create
artificial
intelligence
to
help
us
complete
jobs
and
tasks
that
would
otherwise
take
much
longer
to
do
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
the
developments
of
technology
have
completely
revolutionized
the
way
humans
live
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
it
has
made
a
lasting
impact
on
society
without
the
determination
and
vision
of
the
inventors
and
engineers
who
helped
create
and
develop
these
remarkable
technologies
the
world
would
not
be
the
same
place
it
is
today
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
success
in
any
aspect
of
life
including
job
searching
developing
interpersonal
relationships
and
personal
development
to
better
understand
the
importance
of
having
a
positive
attitude
let
me
use
my
own
story
as
an
example
i
was
recently
laid
off
from
my
job
but
i
refused
to
let
it
define
or
dampen
my
outlook
on
life
instead
i
decided
to
take
it
as
an
opportunity
to
find
my
true
passion
and
use
it
to
build
the
life
i
had
always
wanted
the
knowledge
and
skills
i
gained
from
my
past
job
proved
to
be
advantageous
i
was
able
to
use
these
assets
to
find
a
job
that
i
truly
enjoyed
one
that
would
challenge
and
reward
me
with
my
new
job
came
an
entirely
new
set
of
opportunities
having
a
positive
attitude
also
helped
me
develop
stronger
relationships
with
my
co workers
by
staying
optimistic
i
was
more
likely
to
approach
each
of
them
with
an
open mind
and
a
good
sense
of
humour
this
type
of
attitude
helped
to
foster
a
sense
of
mutual
trust
amongst
us
as
well
as
a
willingness
to
work
together
furthermore
having
a
positive
attitude
has
also
impacted
my
personal
development
it
has
enabled
me
to
approach
each
situation
with
an
optimistic
outlook
even
if
times
get
tough
i
know
that
i
can
rely
on
my
own
inner
strength
and
resilience
to
get
through
it
focusing
on
the
positive
and
looking
for
the
good
in
every
situation
has
allowed
me
to
learn
from
each
experience
enabling
me
to
constantly
grow
and
further
my
personal
development
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
has
enabled
me
to
achieve
success
in
life
particularly
in
job
search
interpersonal
relationships
and
personal
development
it
has
helped
me
to
better
understand
how
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
come
my
way
create
meaningful
relationships
with
others
and
continuously
challenge
and
grow
myself
groups
can
be
great
for
getting
work
done
faster
and
learning
new
things
working
with
a
group
gives
people
the
opportunity
to
find
help
and
support
from
others
whereas
working
alone
can
often
be
overwhelming
and
difficult
one
of
the
benefits
of
working
with
a
group
is
that
it
can
reduce
the
pressure
that
individuals
in
the
group
may
feel
as
it
is
easier
to
divide
the
tasks
and
responsibilities
between
the
members
can
also
help
with
grades
and
learning
new
things
since
people
can
typically
learn
from
one
another
more
easily
in
a
group
setting
in
order
for
groups
to
maximize
their
productivity
teachers
need
to
structure
groups
in
ways
that
are
most
effective
for
the
students
for
example
teams
may
benefit
from
having
a
clear
leader
and
consistent
goals
teachers
can
also
assign
certain
tasks
to
certain
individuals
to
ensure
the
team
is
on
track
and
working
in
a
collaborative
way
implementing
a
program
in
a
high
school
that
allows
students
to
complete
their
course
classes
ahead
of
the
regular
schedule
could
be
a
great
benefit
to
students
this
program
could
help
students
prepare
for
college
by
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
become
familiar
with
the
college
setting
and
academic
expectations
it
could
also
give
students
more
time
to
spend
with
their
families
and
explore
interests
outside
of
school
and
further
it
could
give
students
extra
time
to
work
which
could
help
them
learn
the
importance
of
hard
work
and
build
valuable
experiences
such
as
financial
responsibility
for
their
futures
work
is
a
key
factor
to
success
and
a
program
like
this
could
be
a
blessing
in
teaching
students
this
concept
it
could
allow
students
to
understand
the
long term
rewards
of
putting
in
the
effort
for
short term
goals
learning
to
prioritize
responsibilities
and
balance
academic
and
personal
passions
is
something
that
can
aid
students
throughout
their
lives
with
the
implementation
of
this
program
a
high
school
could
provide
these
valuable
life
lessons
to
their
students
helping
them
to
reach
their
goals
and
create
rewarding
futures
from
the
invention
of
the
telegraph
to
the
endless
notifications
coming
from
our
phones
it
s
clear
to
see
that
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
way
that
people
interact
with
one
another
with
the
advent
of
the
internet
communication
has
become
almost
instantaneous
and
now
conversations
can
be
held
with
anyone
in
the
world
with
ease
social
media
platforms
have
given
us
an
easier
way
to
share
our
thoughts
feelings
opinions
and
even
pictures
with
our
networks
however
technology
can
also
have
a
more
detrimental
effect
on
social
interaction
anonymity
on
the
can
make
people
more
likely
to
say
things
they
would
n t
normally
say
in
person
on
social
media
platforms
people
are
often
judged
by
their
posts
and
likes
and
this
creates
a
false
sense
of
security
in
interactions
people
can
also
become
overly
reliant
on
technology
for
interaction
leading
to
fewer
face to face
conversations
in
daily
life
this
can
have
an
isolating
effect
and
can
lead
to
decreased
social
skills
and
inability
to
connect
with
people
in
more
meaningful
ways
the
increasing
presence
of
technology
in
our
lives
has
both
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
technology
has
certainly
made
it
easier
to
stay
in
touch
with
people
but
it
has
also
made
it
more
difficult
for
people
to
really
connect
with
one
another
it
s
important
to
take
time
to
engage
in
meaningful
conversations
with
one
another
in
order
to
understand
each
other
better
and
forge
lasting
relationships
distance
learning
is
becoming
a
valuable
option
for
many
students
it
provides
students
with
the
freedom
and
flexibility
to
learn
from
wherever
they
are
at
a
pace
that
suits
them
for
students
who
are
not
socially
adept
or
have
had
bad
experiences
at
school
the
ability
to
learn
without
the
pressure
of
peer
judgment
or
the
fear
of
stigma
can
be
a
lifeline
not
being
in
a
physical
classroom
setting
can
help
them
to
feel
more
in
control
of
their
environment
and
can
allow
them
to
focus
on
learning
without
the
distractions
and
anxieties
of
the
typical
school
setting
learning
can
also
be
beneficial
for
students
who
feel
more
comfortable
and
confident
in
their
own
space
as
opposed
to
a
classroom
with
other
students
students
can
learn
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
and
on
their
own
schedule
allowing
them
to
customize
their
learning
experience
and
make
it
unique
to
their
needs
and
preferences
this
can
lead
to
greater
engagement
in
the
learning
material
as
the
student
is
in
a
setting
that
is
familiar
to
them
distance
learning
is
an
invaluable
tool
for
students
helping
them
to
learn
without
the
stresses
of
a
traditional
classroom
setting
it
has
the
potential
to
create
a
more
comfortable
and
safe
learning
environment
that
can
help
all
types
of
students
gain
the
knowledge
and
skills
they
need
for
success
s
quote
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
is
an
insightful
statement
with
imagination
we
are
able
to
think
outside
the
box
and
explore
possibilities
that
may
not
be
immediately
obvious
provides
us
with
the
facts
and
imagination
gives
us
the
power
to
use
them
in
creative
and
innovative
ways
combining
the
two
together
can
lead
to
discoveries
and
solutions
that
are
otherwise
unattainable
for
example
imagine
a
scenario
in
which
you
are
trying
to
solve
a
math
problem
without
the
knowledge
of
basic
mathematics
you
may
be
able
to
use
your
imagination
to
come
up
with
a
creative
solution
but
without
the
knowledge
of
basic
mathematics
it
is
unlikely
that
you
will
be
able
to
come
up
with
the
correct
answer
in
this
case
not
having
knowledge
can
get
you
in
trouble
developing
a
positive
attitude
is
a
key
factor
in
achieving
success
in
life
there
are
countless
successful
people
who
testify
to
this
fact
for
example
the
co founder
of
is
a
famous
example
of
someone
who
used
his
positive
attitude
to
propel
him
to
success
his
strategy
was
to
stay
focused
and
to
have
faith
in
himself
and
the
projects
he
was
working
on despite
facing
many
obstacles
along
the
way
work
and
perseverance
are
also
essential
to
success
setting
goals
and
developing
a
plan
to
reach
them
is
a
great
way
to
stay
committed
and
motivated
after
identifying
their
goal
individuals
should
break
it
into
smaller
achievable
goals
and
create
a
timeline
or
roadmap
finally
it
s
important
to
stay
positive
as
having
a
positive
outlook
makes
it
easier
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
the
school
system
is
the
foundation
on
which
society
bases
its
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
world
it
is
therefore
important
to
ensure
that
schools
have
an
appropriate
amount
of
time
to
adequately
pass
on
knowledge
and
skills
to
students
the
importance
of
this
issue
is
heightened
when
considering
the
causes
and
effects
of
global
energy
and
resource
consumption
the
benefits
of
allowing
for
more
school
days
are
obvious
the
extended
time
gives
students
access
to
more
information
to
better
equip
them
with
the
skills
they
will
need
to
tackle
the
challenges
of
the
future
it
also
has
the
benefit
of
helping
students
develop
their
critical
thinking
and
problem solving
abilities
and
enabling
them
to
explore
a
wider
range
of
topics
and
ideas
increased
school
days
also
means
more
rest
for
students
which
can
help
promote
better
physical
and
mental
health
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
drawbacks
to
having
too
many
school
days
students
will
find
it
difficult
to
juggle
their
academic
commitments
with
their
other
obligations
such
as
social
and
family
responsibilities
they
may
also
become
over burdened
with
the
amount
of
work
that
they
must
complete
leading
to
fatigue
and
potentially
even
lower
grades
overall
there
needs
to
be
a
balance
between
the
importance
of
providing
adequate
time
for
school
and
the
need
to
conserve
energy
and
resources
finding
this
balance
can
be
difficult
but
it
is
essential
in
order
to
ensure
that
students
receive
all
of
the
benefits
of
learning
without
becoming
overwhelmed
ultimately
the
key
is
to
ensure
that
students
are
given
enough
time
to
learn
while
also
respecting
their
other
responsibilities
we
all
know
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
positive
outlook
on
life
a
positive
attitude
has
the
power
to
encourage
us
through
the
difficult
times
to
obtain
better
results
and
to
achieve
our
goals
having
a
healthy
attitude
helps
us
to
make
more
meaningful
connections
in
our
personal
and
professional
lives
it
is
no
surprise
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
to
tackle
many
of
life
s
tricky
situations
from
job
interviews
to
managing
relationships
to
simply
navigating
through
life
it
gives
us
strength
and
helps
us
remain
focused
on
the
big
picture
even
when
faced
with
adversity
and
setbacks
one
example
of
having
a
positive
attitude
leading
to
success
is
after
initial
failure
from
whiskey making
he
didn
t
give
up
he
believed
in
himself
and
his
skills
and
was
able
to
persistently
work
on
a
new
recipe
he
initially
believed
had
no
chance
of
succeeding
it
eventually
led
to
his
family
s
creation
of
s
one
of
s
most
popular
brands
of
whiskey
no
matter
how
hard
life
may
seem
at
times
having
a
positive
attitude
and
believing
in
yourself
can
make
all
the
difference
it
helps
us
to
break
down
obstacles
to
stay
motivated
to
reach
our
goals
and
to
trust
in
ourselves
and
our
journey
having
the
right
attitude
is
key
to
making
great
connections
in
life
and
increasing
our
chances
of
success
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
be
incredibly
helpful
in
living
an
easier
and
more
fulfilled
life
to
illustrate
this
point
i
ll
share
two
true
stories
the
first
story
is
from
my
own
experience
when
i
was
struggling
with
a
mental
health
issue
i
decided
to
reach
out
to
a
professional
counselor
for
help
through
talking
with
the
counselor
i
was
able
to
identify
unhealthy
patterns
of
thinking
that
were
holding
me
back
with
the
help
of
the
counselor
s
guidance
i
was
able
to
let
go
of
many
of
these
patterns
and
move
forward
with
more
confidence
the
second
story
comes
from
my
family
recently
my
father
encountered
a
difficult
financial
situation
he
was
getting
nowhere
trying
to
solve
the
problem
on
his
own
however
when
my
father
sought
advice
from
a
financial
expert
he
was
able
to
come
up
with
an
effective
plan
to
get
back
on
track
my
father
was
eventually
able
to
overcome
this
obstacle
with
the
help
of
the
financial
expert
s
advice
these
two
stories
clearly
demonstrate
the
importance
of
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
to
live
an
easier
and
more
fulfilled
life
it
s
important
to
be
open
to
seeking
help
from
those
who
have
more
knowledge
and
experience
in
many
cases
this
advice
can
be
the
key
to
unlocking
greater
success
and
happiness
asking
multiple
people
for
advice
can
be
a
beneficial
decision making
strategy
by
doing
this
one
can
gain
perspectives
from
a
more
diverse
range
of
sources
allowing
for
a
more
balanced
and
informed
decision
this
could
lead
to
a
better
choice
than
what
might
be
derived
from
a
single
opinion
furthermore
by
listening
to
a
variety
of
counsel
one
may
be
exposed
to
new
ideas
and
solutions
to
a
problem
reaffirming
convictions
or
allowing
for
a
more
personalized
solution
this
method
can
also
provide
an
individual
with
a
more
in depth
understanding
of
the
situation
as
each
party
usually
provides
their
personal
perspective
that
can
contextually
provide
more
information
in
addition
this
individual
can
learn
how
to
analyze
a
situation
from
multiple
points
of
view
allowing
this
person
to
make
more
informed
choices
beyond
the
dilemma
in
question
overall
seeking
advice
from
different
people
can
be
an
invaluable
asset
that
can
help
someone
greatly
in
life
both
in
the
short term
and
long term
with
a
broad
range
of
experiences
and
perspectives
gathering
advice
from
multiple
people
is
a
tool
with
great
potential
to
help
someone
make
more
thoughtful
and
sound
decisions
that
can
have
a
lasting
and
positive
impact
our
understanding
of
the
world
is
never
static
and
is
constantly
shifting
and
evolving
and
s
quote
reflects
this
he
argues
that
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
suggesting
changes
in
order
to
fit
in
being
true
to
one
s
own
self
is
an
incredibly
difficult
yet
highly
rewarding
accomplishment
one
real life
example
that
serves
as
an
embodiment
of
s
quote
is
despite
immense
pressure
to
conform
to
the
oppressive
colonial
rule
of
the
british
chose
to
stay
true
to
his
beliefs
and
values
leading
to
independence
without
any
bloodshed
even
in
the
toughest
of
circumstances
stayed
true
to
his
convictions
which
is
a
strong
reflection
of
s
sentiment
another
example
would
be
the
renowned
scientist
despite
living
in
a
society
that
championed
men
s
scientific
contributions
over
those
of
women
continued
to
follow
her
passion
for
science
and
influenced
many
modern
discoveries
she
was
incredibly
successful
in
her
field
and
gained
recognition
in
a
time
where
women
were
largely
underrepresented
in
the
field
of
science
and
were
actively
discouraged
to
explore
their
true
potential
these
examples
demonstrate
the
strength
of
s
quote
as
both
and
succeeded
despite
the
attempts
of
the
outside
world
to
shape
and
mould
them
into
something
they
were
not
it
is
through
the
accomplishments
of
these
inspiring
individuals
as
well
as
countless
others
that
we
can
understand
the
truth
of
s
quote
that
to
be
yourself
despite
any
obstacles
that
may
arise
is
truly
the
greatest
accomplishment
technology
has
had
a
profound
effect
on
almost
every
aspect
of
modern
life
it
has
helped
us
to
stay
connected
with
our
loved
ones
around
the
world
expand
our
knowledge
and
make
tasks
easier
and
faster
but
it
has
also
come
with
its
own
share
of
drawbacks
in
this
essay
i
will
explore
both
the
positive
and
negative
aspects
of
technology
on
the
positive
side
technology
has
allowed
us
to
be
more
productive
than
ever
before
we
are
able
to
access
vast
amounts
of
information
in
a
matter
of
seconds
we
can
communicate
and
connect
with
people
faster
and
easier
than
ever
before
allowing
us
to
stay
in
touch
with
friends
and
family
spread
around
the
globe
also
makes
it
easier
to
automate
tedious
tasks
allowing
us
to
work
more
efficiently
however
there
are
some
possible
drawbacks
to
technology
as
well
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
is
the
distraction
that
technology
can
provide
as
people
become
easily
distracted
by
their
devices
or
the
various
forms
of
media
available
online
it
can
also
be
an
isolating
force
causing
people
to
become
more
disconnected
from
real life
interactions
another
issue
is
cyber
security
as
hackers
and
malicious
software
can
put
our
personal
information
and
data
at
risk
in
conclusion
the
development
of
technology
has
had
both
positive
and
negative
impacts
on
our
lives
despite
the
possible
drawbacks
technology
can
be
used
as
a
powerful
tool
to
increase
productivity
connectivity
and
knowledge
as
long
as
we
are
mindful
of
how
we
use
technology
we
can
reap
the
benefits
while
avoiding
the
pitfalls
when
making
decisions
it
can
be
beneficial
to
seek
multiple
opinions
in
order
to
ensure
the
best
possible
outcome
doing
so
can
help
prevent
poor
choices
by
giving
a
person
multiple
perspectives
to
consider
collecting
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
seeking
multiple
opinions
can
help
someone
make
better
decisions
is
important
in
order
to
clearly
identify
the
benefits
it
can
provide
after
researching
and
analyzing
the
evidence
it
becomes
clear
that
seeking
multiple
opinions
can
help
someone
make
better
decisions
by
preventing
poor
choices
determining
which
advice
is
accurate
and
helping
to
ensure
comfort
with
decisions
by
having
a
range
of
people
provide
their
opinions
and
insights
on
a
situation
one
can
often
identify
opportunities
or
identify
potential
pitfalls
in
a
decision
that
wouldn
t
have
been
identified
if
a
single
opinion
was
relied
on
ultimately
seeking
multiple
opinions
provides
the
opportunity
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
situation
and
make
an
informed
decision
with
regards
to
whatever
the
issue
may
be
the
debate
over
whether
or
not
smartphones
are
a
positive
or
negative
addition
in
the
classroom
has
been
going
on
for
some
time
there
are
arguments
to
be
made
for
both
sides
each
with
their
own
arguments
for
and
against
their
usage
in
school
on
one
hand
cell
phones
offer
students
many
advantages
such
as
the
ability
to
access
a
vast
amount
of
information
quickly
and
efficiently
additionally
using
a
smartphone
gives
students
more
flexibility
when
it
comes
to
accessing
their
course
materials
and
can
also
allow
for
increased
collaboration
among
students
on
the
other
hand
there
are
negatives
associated
with
using
a
cell
phone
in
the
classroom
including
distractions
increased
potential
for
cheating
or
sharing
answers
and
a
lack
of
focus
on
the
lesson
when
compared
to
using
computers
in
the
classroom
cell
phone
use
offers
a
different
set
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
instance
using
a
smartphone
may
offer
the
same
ability
to
access
a
large
amount
of
information
quickly
and
efficiently
but
there
may
be
fewer
distractions
additionally
smartphones
are
much
more
affordable
and
accessible
than
computers
unfortunately
smartphones
also
often
have
more
limitations
than
computers
on
what
kind
of
tasks
can
be
done
the
effects
of
using
phones
in
the
classroom
can
be
wide ranging
and
depend
largely
on
how
phones
are
used
if
students
are
using
their
phones
during
class
time
for
learning
purposes
it
can
be
beneficial
however
if
they
are
using
it
for
social
purposes
such
as
texting
or
checking
social
media
this
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
focus
and
engagement
it
can
also
lead
to
an
increase
in
cheating
or
sharing
information
during
tests
or
exams
ultimately
while
smartphones
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
in
the
classroom
there
are
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
manage
their
use
schools
can
implement
policies
that
limit
the
types
of
activities
that
students
can
do
on
their
phones
such
as
prohibiting
social
media
use
or
restrict
their
use
to
certain
times
during
the
day
additionally
schools
can
educate
students
on
responsible
phone
use
and
provide
resources
for
academic
support
these
steps
can
help
ensure
that
students
are
using
their
phones
in
a
responsible
way
that
will
still
allow
them
access
to
the
resources
they
need
to
succeed
i
walked
up
to
the
stranger
sitting
alone
at
lunch
and
asked
if
they
d
like
to
join
me
and
my
friends
over
lunch
we
introduced
ourselves
and
i
noticed
how
excited
they
were
to
have
a
new
group
of
people
to
talk
to
after
lunch
i
offered
to
give
them
a
tour
of
our
school
and
introduce
them
to
some
of
the
clubs
and
activities
as
we
walked
around
the
school
i
pointed
out
all
the
different
opportunities
available
and
how
much
fun
they
can
be
after
the
tour
we
said
our
goodbyes
and
i
walked
away
feeling
good
about
my
gesture
when
i
returned
to
my
friends
i
listened
to
them
talk
about
their
day
and
their
issues
i
provided
them
with
helpful
advice
when
they
needed
it
showing
them
that
i
cared
about
them
i
was
glad
that
i
was
able
to
help
them
even
in
such
a
small
way
studies
have
shown
that
enforcing
curfews
for
teenagers
can
help
reduce
the
likelihood
of
them
getting
into
trouble
can
help
to
keep
young
people
in
a
safe
environment
and
help
to
provide
structure
in
their
lives
in
addition
research
has
also
found
that
curfews
can
provide
parents
with
peace
of
mind
knowing
that
their
children
are
safe
there
are
also
activities
and
resources
that
teenagers
can
participate
in
that
will
help
to
keep
them
out
of
trouble
examples
of
these
include
sports
community
volunteering
after school
programs
and
even
mentoring
schemes
which
can
provide
young
people
with
an
outlet
for
their
emotions
and
involvement
in
constructive
activities
these
resources
can
help
to
divert
teenagers
attention
away
from
criminal
activities
that
could
lead
to
trouble
is
arguably
one
of
the
greatest
soccer
players
of
all
time
his
success
is
a
testament
to
the
power
of
determination
and
the
belief
that
with
enough
grit
and
perseverance
anything
is
possible
s
story
serves
as
an
example
of
how
persistence
and
hard
work
can
lead
to
unimaginable
success
in
a
similar
vein
the
technological
advances
of
the
past
two
hundred
years
have
showcased
the
human
race
s
ability
to
persevere
and
strive
for
greatness
from
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
to
the
launch
of
the
first
artificial
intelligence
program
humankind
has
proven
time
and
time
again
that
dedication
and
resilience
can
lead
to
tremendous
progress
this
rings
true
today
more
than
ever
as
technology
continues
to
expand
evolve
and
revolutionize
every
aspect
of
our
lives
the
strength
of
the
human
will
to
persevere
has
been
highlighted
exquisitely
by
and
the
technological
advances
of
the
past
two
hundred
years
through
these
examples
it
is
clear
that
no
matter
how
daunting
the
path
ahead
may
seem
with
enough
dedication
and
commitment
anything
is
possible
in
the
modern
age
technology
has
had
a
simultaneously
beneficial
and
damaging
effect
on
social
relations
media
platforms
have
provided
opportunities
to
stay
connected
with
acquaintances
and
make
new
friends
while
at
the
same
time
making
it
easier
to
live
alone
and
engage
in
cyberbullying
this
is
especially
the
case
for
young
people
who
are
heavily
influenced
by
the
media
they
are
exposed
to
in
day to day
life
while
technology
can
be
used
as
a
tool
for
self expression
and
productivity
there
are
also
serious
risks
associated
with
the
misuse
of
this
power
parents
have
a
responsibility
to
ensure
their
children
are
developing
essential
social
skills
such
as
communication
and
problem solving
and
to
limit
the
use
of
technology
in
order
to
benefit
their
children
in
the
long
run
when
said
determine
never
to
be
elderly
he
likely
meant
that
we
should
never
stop
learning
and
striving
no
matter
our
age
it
is
especially
important
to
never
give
up
because
this
can
lead
to
new
opportunities
personal
growth
and
a
renewed
sense
of
purpose
for
example
my
grandmother
despite
being
in
her
decided
to
learn
to
use
the
computer
with
some
initial
support
from
my
family
she
not
only
mastered
the
basics
of
computer
use
but
found
an
online
library
of
books
she
could
borrow
this
newfound
knowledge
and
access
to
books
allowed
her
to
explore
new
topics
and
ideas
and
gave
her
an
air
of
independence
and
accomplishment
another
example
is
a
ministry
partner
of
ours
who
was
faced
with
a
health
challenge
that
threatened
her
mobility
this
did
n t
stop
her
from
starting
a
new
organization
though
and
today
her
hard
work
perseverance
and
never say die
attitude
have
resulted
in
a
thriving
business
that
uplifts
and
nourishes
many
people
in
her
community
in
my
own
life
i
ve
found
that
when
i
face
adversity
and
choose
to
power
through
it
i
always
end
up
with
a
greater
sense
of
accomplishment
and
self worth
in
each
case
it
s
only
through
remaining
steadfast
in
my
efforts
that
i
have
been
able
to
move
past
the
challenge
and
embrace
the
rewards
that
come
from
never
giving
up
when
it
comes
to
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
like
sports
and
yearbook
work
at
school
there
are
a
variety
of
potential
explanations
as
to
why
some
students
may
choose
to
opt
out
high
levels
of
stress
and
anxiety
a
lack
of
access
to
resources
or
a
feeling
that
they
do
n t
fit
in
can
all
lead
to
students
avoiding
extracurriculars
being
unable
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
can
have
long term
negative
effects
these
activities
often
present
important
opportunities
for
students
to
interact
with
each
other
and
learn
important
skills
like
teamwork
cooperation
and
communication
all
of
which
can
become
important
tools
for
long term
success
without
opportunities
to
learn
and
practice
these
skills
students
may
struggle
to
function
comfortably
in
both
college
and
the
workplace
additionally
students
may
miss
out
on
potential
college
invitations
or
job
offers
due
to
a
deficiency
in
these
crucial
abilities
the
organization
i
am
applying
for
offers
numerous
opportunities
to
those
seeking
to
gain
new
skills
and
experience
in
a
vibrant
learning
environment
this
organization
allows
for
up
to
participants
in
each
class
and
uses
a
number
of
different
teaching
methods
to
ensure
the
most
effective
learning
outcome
is
achieved
by
actively
incorporating
different
methods
the
organization
rewards
active
and
engaged
participants
with
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
material
my
previous
experience
of
collaborating
with
a
wide
variety
of
people
coupled
with
my
interest
in
learning
new
concepts
and
skills
makes
me
an
ideal
participant
in
the
program
i
understand
the
importance
of
working
collaboratively
and
also
how
to
remain
focused
in
a
productive
learning
environment
i
have
a
strong
work
ethic
and
am
able
to
remain
motivated
to
reach
my
goals
offering
a
consistent
effort
and
dedication
i
am
also
self motivated
and
not
afraid
to
take
initiative
often
finding
creative
solutions
to
problems
or
taking
the
lead
during
group
tasks
and
activities
i
believe
my
experience
and
qualities
make
me
an
ideal
candidate
for
the
position
and
am
excited
to
take
part
in
such
a
varied
and
stimulating
environment
every
day
we
come
into
contact
with
a
variety
of
people
whether
it
s
a
stranger
on
the
street
or
a
potential
new
boss
as
humans
we
often
make
snap
judgments
that
are
based
on
first
impressions
and
it
s
no
secret
that
these
initial
impressions
can
have
a
lasting
impact
on
relationships
both
personally
and
professionally
the
significance
of
a
first
impression
is
relevant
in
a
myriad
of
situations
as
it
has
the
potential
to
shape
the
way
one
is
perceived
the
way
one
presents
themselves
and
their
immediate
attitude
and
behavior
are
some
of
the
biggest
factors
in
leaving
a
good
first
impression
depending
on
the
situation
it
s
a
good
idea
to
be
aware
of
body
language
and
practice
exhibiting
respect
and
kindness
towards
others
as
these
behaviors
can
assist
in
creating
a
favorable
first
impression
although
the
impact
of
first
impressions
can
be
notable
it
may
not
be
possible
to
change
the
impression
someone
has
of
you
after
the
first
meeting
this
can
be
especially
true
in
cases
when
an
individual
has
a
knee jerk
reaction
to
a
situation
as
these
types
of
initial
reactions
can
be
difficult
to
alter
it
is
important
to
remember
that
despite
the
fact
that
some
first
impressions
may
be
impossible
to
change
everyone
is
deserving
of
kindness
and
respect
attending
classes
online
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
students
who
are
looking
for
an
alternative
to
traditional
schooling
many
students
find
that
they
can
benefit
from
the
increased
flexibility
that
online
schools
provide
allowing
them
to
fit
their
educational
pursuits
into
their
work
and
family
life
additionally
online
schools
can
offer
access
to
a
wider
range
of
courses
and
subject
areas
providing
more
specific
focus
for
students
and
enabling
parents
to
tailor
their
child
s
syllabus
in
addition
to
offering
a
more
flexible
approach
online
schools
may
also
provide
opportunities
for
individuals
wishing
to
return
to
education
later
in
life
without
having
to
attend
physical
classes
busy
working
adults
can
pursue
their
studies
at
their
own
pace
allowing
them
to
take
time
to
explore
new
topics
and
learn
at
a
rate
which
suits
them
when
weighing
up
the
pros
and
cons
of
attending
an
online
school
it
is
important
to
consider
the
costs
associated
with
these
types
of
educational
programs
although
costs
may
be
reduced
in
comparison
with
traditional
settings
many
online
schools
still
require
students
to
purchase
textbooks
or
other
learning
materials
which
could
increase
the
overall
financial
burden
additionally
the
lack
of
face to face
interaction
with
instructors
can
make
it
difficult
to
ask
questions
and
get
feedback
in
time sensitive
situations
overall
online
schools
can
provide
a
valuable
alternative
to
traditional
institutions
despite
the
potential
drawbacks
online
schooling
can
offer
more
flexible
schedules
greater
access
to
course
material
and
improved
access
to
education
for
adults
when
people
feel
the
need
to
always
be
working
they
can
easily
become
overwhelmed
and
suffer
from
burnout
taking
breaks
not
only
provides
a
physical
and
mental
respite
but
can
also
lead
to
a
more
positive
outcome
for
the
quality
of
one
s
work
allow
for
moments
of
quiet
contemplation
and
reflection
helping
to
fuel
creativity
they
can
also
help
to
reduce
stress
levels
and
improve
concentration
on
a
personal
level
i
can
attest
that
taking
breaks
can
be
a
great
support
in
an
always working
mentality
i
often
take
breaks
during
the
day
to
distract
myself
from
the
work
allowing
me
to
come
back
with
a
renewed
clarity
and
focus
i
find
that
not
only
do
i
work
more
efficiently
but
i
also
have
more
solutions
and
ideas
for
the
tasks
and
projects
that
i
am
working
on
overall
committing
to
taking
breaks
on
a
regular
basis
not
only
allows
for
increased
focus
and
productivity
but
also
adds
to
improved
physical
and
mental
health
when
making
decisions
individuals
can
either
rely
on
their
own
understanding
and
judgment
or
seek
out
guidance
from
those
with
superior
expertise
and
experience
each
approach
has
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
making
self made
decisions
is
generally
quicker
and
requires
less
effort
the
individual
has
direct
control
of
the
decision making
process
self made
decisions
may
also
provide
an
individual
with
a
greater
sense
of
accomplishment
the
result
of
their
choices
and
understanding
are
directly
tangible
however
this
approach
has
the
potential
to
be
more
error prone
as
there
is
a
lack
of
the
experience
and
knowledge
that
others
can
provide
additionally
individual
biases
can
mean
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
informed
decisions
with
the
best
interests
of
everyone
in
mind
seeking
out
advice
from
those
with
expertise
and
experience
can
be
beneficial
in
terms
of
access
to
valuable
knowledge
and
understanding
furthermore
the
collective
wisdom
of
experts
can
provide
a
balance
to
personal
biases
however
this
approach
can
often
be
more
time consuming
and
costly
additionally
it
may
be
difficult
to
find
the
appropriate
expert
and
to
trust
that
their
advice
is
unbiased
in
conclusion
both
self made
decisions
and
those
made
with
the
help
of
a
person
with
more
expertise
and
experience
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
each
individual
needs
to
consider
their
specific
situation
and
resources
in
order
to
decide
which
approach
is
most
suitable
for
them
after
completing
research
on
careers
related
to
the
automotive
industry
i
discovered
multiple
paths
to
pursue
mechanics
mechanics
for
self driving
vehicles
electricians
and
jobs
at
companies
such
as
and
all
offer
a
wide
range
of
opportunities
education wise
most
positions
require
a
technical
college
degree
although
there
are
apprenticeship
and
internship
options
for
those
with
only
a
high
school
degree
in
addition
many
of
these
positions
require
experience
in
the
field
and
significant
technical
know how
as
part
of
my
action
plan
i
will
begin
by
exploring
apprenticeship
and
internships
options
in
the
industry
i
will
also
investigate
other
avenues
for
stepping
into
an
automotive
career
without
attending
an
expensive
and
time consuming
technical
college
finally
i
will
research
what
technical
skills
are
essential
for
a
given
role
refocusing
my
attention
on
gaining
more
knowledge
and
experience
in
these
areas
is
an
important
factor
in
any
student
s
academic
success
and
overall
well being
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
help
encourage
the
development
of
strong
self esteem
in
students
focusing
on
effort
rather
than
results
can
be
a
key
factor
in
fostering
a
growth
mindset
and
helping
students
to
value
themselves
even
during
difficult
learning
experiences
setting
reasonable
goals
and
breaking
down
larger
tasks
into
smaller
more
achievable
components
is
an
important
part
of
the
process
in
order
for
students
to
continue
to
work
hard
and
measure
their
own
progress
praise
and
encouragement
from
teachers
family
and
peers
can
be
a
great
way
to
celebrate
a
student
s
successes
and
foster
self belief
self esteem
also
has
a
range
of
benefits
such
as
improved
mental
health
resilience
and
general
motivation
believing
in
one
s
own
capabilities
is
an
essential
part
of
the
journey
towards
success
and
should
be
part
of
every
student
s
journey
the
ancient
storyteller
is
remembered
for
his
saying
act
of
kindness
no
matter
how
small
is
ever
wasted
this
quote
reminds
us
of
the
power
of
even
the
smallest
acts
of
kindness
it
encourages
us
to
make
a
positive
difference
in
the
world
no
matter
how
insignificant
it
may
seem
i
once
witnessed
an
example
of
this
while
on
a
bus
a
man
who
had
gotten
on
the
bus
at
an
earlier
stop
quietly
took
out
a
package
of
snacks
he
had
brought
and
began
to
offer
them
to
the
other
passengers
this
small
act
of
kindness
left
a
lasting
impression
on
me
as
it
highlighted
the
power
of
kindness
acts
of
kindness
are
rooted
in
empathy
they
are
motivated
by
an
inherent
need
to
do
something
good
for
another
person
as
well
as
a
desire
to
make
them
feel
better
when
we
perform
an
act
of
kindness
we
can
feel
rewarded
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
the
recipient
of
the
act
is
also
filled
with
a
sense
of
wellbeing
and
joy
has
the
power
to
form
connections
and
restore
morale
in
both
parties
pairing
older
and
younger
students
together
can
have
a
plethora
of
educational
benefits
for
both
parties
not
only
does
it
give
younger
students
a
chance
to
learn
from
more
experienced
peers
but
it
also
allows
older
students
to
gain
experience
in
leadership
for
example
older
students
can
teach
younger
students
essential
academic
skills
such
as
problem solving
and
critical
thinking
while
younger
students
can
help
the
older
students
stay
up to date
on
the
latest
trends
in
technology
and
social
media
both
students
can
benefit
from
the
social
aspect
of
partnering
together
the
younger
student
can
gain
a
role
model
to
emulate
and
a
strong
positive
influence
from
the
older
student
the
older
student
can
hone
their
leadership
skills
by
encouraging
the
younger
student
to
do
their
best
and
stay
engaged
in
addition
to
these
academic
and
social
benefits
the
students
can
enhance
their
emotional
intelligence
by
learning
to
express
and
accept
emotions
in
healthy
ways
overall
pairing
older
and
younger
students
together
can
result
in
many
positive
outcomes
both
academically
and
socially
the
combined
knowledge
and
experience
from
both
sets
of
students
can
develop
an
environment
of
learning
and
exploration
that
can
be
immensely
beneficial
to
both
parties
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
debate
centered
around
whether
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
famously
stated
that
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
while
it
is
certainly
important
to
foster
creativity
and
cultivate
imagination
i
believe
that
knowledge
is
actually
more
valuable
and
should
be
given
greater
precedence
is
the
accumulation
of
facts
and
information
that
has
been
learned
through
experience
and
study
it
provides
us
with
a
base
of
facts
from
which
we
can
draw
conclusions
and
extrapolate
information
helps
us
make
decisions
and
offers
us
a
reliable
foundation
from
which
to
build
upon
while
imagination
is
a
tool
which
allows
us
to
take
what
we
already
know
and
use
it
to
create
something
entirely
new
an
example
of
the
differences
between
imagination
and
knowledge
can
be
seen
in
the
case
of
a
scientist
mistakenly
believing
that
knowledge
and
imagination
are
mutually
exclusive
some
may
think
that
a
scientist
s
goal
is
simply
to
possess
lots
of
knowledge
however
this
is
not
the
case
as
a
scientist
s
job
is
actually
to
use
what
they
already
know
to
come
up
with
new
ideas
and
solutions
in
this
way
imagination
and
knowledge
are
integrated
and
both
used
to
further
scientific
research
the
importance
of
imagination
and
knowledge
may
be
more
balanced
than
what
initially
implied
serves
as
the
foundation
for
creative
ideas
and
imagination
is
the
key
that
makes
these
ideas
a
reality
together
knowledge
and
imagination
have
the
ability
to
shape
the
world
in
ways
that
would
otherwise
not
be
possible
ultimately
both
imagination
and
knowledge
are
essential
components
for
meaningful
discovery
and
it
is
important
to
employ
both
in
our
day to day
lives
learning
classes
allow
students
to
receive
education
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
however
there
are
some
arguments
to
consider
when
debating
whether
or
not
such
classes
are
an
appropriate
substitute
for
traditional
schooling
the
most
notable
drawbacks
of
distance
learning
classes
are
issues
with
distractions
homework
struggles
and
financial
hardship
there
are
a
higher
number
of
potential
distractions
for
students
attending
distance
learning
classes
from
home
common
distractions
can
include
siblings
pets
television
computers
and
mobile
phones
these
distractions
can
be
difficult
to
ignore
and
may
lead
to
a
lack
of
time
spent
focused
on
their
studies
these
instances
of
distraction
and
procrastination
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
academic
performance
homework
struggles
can
be
more
present
in
virtual
classrooms
compared
to
traditional
classrooms
this
is
due
to
students
being
unable
to
ask
their
teacher
for
help
in
real time
without
the
more
immediate
help
assignments
such
as
homework
and
projects
may
become
more
difficult
for
students
to
complete
as
a
result
they
could
fall
behind
other
students
and
find
it
more
difficult
to
keep
up
with
their
studies
finally
distance
learning
classes
could
potentially
increase
financial
difficulties
for
students
with
students
already
facing
tuition
and
book
costs
the
lack
of
assistance
provided
by
distance
learning
classes
may
lead
to
less
economic
support
aid
and
scholarships
would
be
much
less
beneficial
to
distance
learning
students
who
don
t
attend
an
in person
class
and
student
loan
guidelines
are
often
inflexible
this
could
lead
to
additional
stress
and
further
strain
on
a
student
s
budget
in
conclusion
distance
learning
classes
are
not
the
ideal
learning
environment
for
students
considering
factors
such
as
distractions
homework
struggles
and
financial
issues
as
such
students
should
carefully
consider
all
of
the
drawbacks
associated
with
distance
learning
classes
before
making
the
decision

attend
such
classes

and

offering
a
safe
platform
for
collaboration

working
in
a

provides
many
advantages
such
as
increased
coordination
and

to
create

productive
and
cooperative

immigrants
coming
to
a
new
country
often
face
many
challenges
but
can
also
receive
many
benefits
they
come
with
new
skills
fresh
ideas
and
a
deep
appreciation
of
different
cultures
this
provides
an
opportunity
for
increased
cultural
understanding
and
more
vibrant
communities
learning
a
new
language
can
be
difficult
and
overwhelming
it
requires
time
and
dedication
as
well
as
the
ability
to
practice
and
apply
language
skills
to
everyday
activities
it
can
help
to
limit
new
vocabulary
and
concepts
to
what
can
be
easily
used
in
conversation
and
create
opportunities
to
practice
writing
speaking
and
listening
additionally
everyday
activities
such
as
shopping
going
for
a
walk
and
listening
to
music
can
foster
creative
and
interactive
ways
for
language
learning
and
teachers
play
a
key
role
in
helping
immigrants
adjust
to
a
new
environment
they
offer
a
variety
of
resources
to
help
immigrants
with
language
skills
and
cultural
understanding
experienced
educators
also
provide
mentorship
support
and
guidance
which
are
invaluable
tools
in
aiding
a
smoother
transition
period
ultimately
teachers
and
programs
help
to
set
immigrants
up
for
long term
success
and
help
to
create
a
more
diverse
and
involved
community
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
understood
the
importance
of
seeing
failure
not
as
a
sign
of
defeat
but
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
he
viewed
failure
as
a
necessary
step
en
route
to
success
without
failure
there
would
be
no
progress
in
contrast
my
own
view
on
failure
is
one
of
resilience
and
acceptance
i
believe
that
failure
should
be
embraced
as
an
inherent
part
of
one
s
journey
towards
success
i
do
n t
believe
that
failure
is
something
that
should
bring
shame
or
guilt
but
rather
something
that
should
be
viewed
as
an
opportunity
for
growth
and
development
i
believe
that
failure
can
be
used
to
further
one
s
learning
as
we
can
always
learn
from
our
mistakes
ultimately
failure
should
be
accepted
as
an
inevitable
part
of
life
and
the
resilience
to
keep
trying
and
trying
again
is
the
only
true
measure
of
success
when
considering
the
pros
and
cons
of
deciding
on
a
career
before
high
school
there
are
a
variety
of
factors
to
consider
on
the
one
hand
deciding
on
a
career
path
before
high
school
can
help
students
to
develop
a
sense
of
direction
and
motivation
as
they
become
more
focused
on
the
studies
and
experiences
which
will
aid
them
in
achieving
their
goals
with
early
career
focus
they
can
better
plan
their
coursework
and
extracurricular
activities
to
gain
the
skills
and
credentials
needed
to
enter
the
desired
field
on
the
other
hand
having
a
fixed
career
plan
in
high
school
can
be
limiting
young
adults
are
still
developing
and
may
discover
a
passion
for
a
new
field
or
gain
a
different
perspective
on
their
future
path
by
committing
to
one
career
choice
before
exploratory
experiences
students
might
decide
against
a
field
that
they
eventually
discover
to
be
a
perfect
fit
additionally
since
career
paths
are
constantly
changing
what
seems
like
a
sensible
decision
at
one
moment
in
time
may
no
longer
be
applicable
a
few
years
in
the
future
overall
there
are
both
reasonable
arguments
for
and
against
deciding
on
career
paths
before
high
school
while
there
is
a
certain
utility
to
early
focus
there
is
also
benefit
to
leaving
room
for
exploration
and
change
ultimately
the
decision
rests
with
the
individual
and
the
best
choice
is
likely
to
vary
on
a
case by case
basis
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
achieving
success
in
any
area
of
life
having
a
positive
outlook
not
only
helps
you
stay
motivated
and
work
hard

it
also
helps
you
to
develop
the
right
mindset
needed
for
successful
outcomes
with
a
positive
attitude
you
can
focus
on
solutions
instead
of
obstacles
you
can
also
develop
small
achievable
goals
that
will
create
momentum
and
give
you
greater
enthusiasm
for
your
efforts
a
positive
attitude
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
our
success
in
life
people
who
take
on
challenges
with
an
optimistic
outlook
and
look
for
opportunities
in
difficult
situations
are
more
likely
to
succeed
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
become
more
creative
and
resourceful
enabling
us
to
work
through
challenges
and
find
solutions
it
also
helps
us
to
overcome
fear
and
take
risks
knowing
that
our
actions
are
in
the
right
direction

there
is
something
to

stay
resilient
in
times
of
difficulty
it
encourages
us
to
take

and
opportunities
people
who
possess
a
positive
attitude
are
more
likely
to
reach
their
goals
and
have
a
greater
success
in
life
before
the
invention
and
widespread
use
of
technology
finding
a
job
shopping
and
communication
between
people
took
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
people
had
to
manually
search
for
job
postings
travel
to
physical
stores
to
purchase
items
and
wait
for
weeks
or
months
for
a
letter
or
package
to
arrive
however
with
the
introduction
of
technology
all
of
these
tasks
have
become
much
easier
it
is
now
possible
to
find
job
postings
online
and
submit
applications
with
just
the
click
of

shopping
can
be
done
with
the

of
digital
stores

improved
by
technology
allowing

much
simpler

more
efficient
than
it
was
before

the
impact
of
technology
on
society
has
been
profound
and
its
advantages
can
be
seen
in
almost
every
aspect
of
our
lives
older
students
within
a
school
system
have
the
opportunity
to
be
extremely
helpful
to
the
younger
generations
coming
up
from
their
experience
knowledge
and
wisdom
they
can
provide
support
to
those
who
are
just
starting
out
these
students
can
be
mentors
helping
to
provide
guidance
when
it
comes
to
school
and
social
matters
they
can
take
the
time
to
explain
topics
that
may
be
difficult
to
understand
they
can
help
younger
students
assess
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
allowing
them
to
understand
what
subjects
they
excel
in
and
may
need
extracurricular
assistance
in
older
students
can
also
offer
support
in
a
more
subtle
way
by
simply
being
a
positive
influence
in
the
school
even
the
smallest
action
such
as
smiling
and
nodding
at
a
shy
younger
student
in
the
hallway
can
go
a
long
way
they
can
set
a
great
example
for
the
student
body
demonstrating
qualities
such
as
respect
and
courtesy
in
the
end
older

have
the
power
to
be
an
essential
asset
to
the
younger

in
their
school
through
mentorship
guidance
and
a

a
park
also
provides
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
sights

many
people
find
working
in
groups
to
be
a
beneficial
experience
through
collaborating
with
others
one
can
gain
valuable
knowledge
while
having
a
blast
working
in
groups
gives
the
opportunity
for
individual
members
of
the
group
to
specialize
in
certain
topics
leading
to
a
wealth
of
collected
knowledge
taking
breaks
allows
for
the
group
to
relax
and
process
what
they
have
already
learned
as
well
as
giving
the
opportunity
for
new
ideas
to

groups
provides
the
incentive
for
members
to
stay
motivated
and
finish
assignments
faster
with
the
collective
effort
and
energy
of
a
group
tasks
can
be
completed
much
more
quickly
than
when
one
is
working
on
their
own
in
conclusion
working
in
groups
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
in
terms
of
having
more
knowledge
taking
breaks
to
relax
and
finishing
tasks
faster
is
a
key
factor
in
a
person
s
success
in
life
a
positive
attitude
can
be
cultivated
from
a
young
age
in
order
to
foster
resilience
and
grit
both
of
which
are
essential
tools
towards
achieving
success
those
with
a
positive
attitude
are
more
likely
to
continue
pushing
despite
setbacks
or
difficult
circumstances
this
can
be
particularly
helpful
during
times
of
high
stress
or
when
faced
with
obstacles
on
the
other
hand
those
with
a
negative
attitude
may
find
it
harder
to
cope
with
challenges
that
arise
ultimately
leading
to
lower
chances
of
success
moreover
negative
attitude
keeps
people
from
taking
risks
and
trying
new
things
whereas
a
positive
attitude
encourages
curiosity
and
action taking
which
can
move
a
person
closer
to
their
goals
the
effects
of
a
person
s
upbringing
on
their
attitude
and
how
this
affects
their
success
in
life
can
not
be
understated
those
who
are
raised
in
an
environment
of
positivity
support
and
love
are
likely
to
have
a
better
outlook
on
life
on
the
contrary
those
who
were
raised
in
an
environment
of
neglect
or
criticism
may
more
readily
adopt
negative
attitudes
thinking
that
their
efforts
will
not
lead
to
anything
positive
however
this
can
be
counteracted
through
motivation
exercises
and
encouraging
words
from
supportive
figures
as
well
as
creating
a
positive
environment
for
growth
and
achievement
in
conclusion
attitude
is
an
important
component
of
success
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
a
person
face
challenges
and
achieve
their
goals
additionally
a
person
s
upbringing
can
shape
their
attitude
making
it
important
to
build
a
supportive
and
encouraging
environment
for
those
around
us
one
success
story
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
of
my
cousin
she
has
always
faced
hardship
in
her
life
from
struggling
with
a
learning
disability
to
experiencing
health
problems
despite
this
she
has
always
had
a
positive
attitude
in
one
of
her
most
difficult
times
she
was
dealing
with
a
major
health
issue
and
was
feeling
very
discouraged
in
the
face
of
this
struggle
she
decided
to
keep
her
spirits
up
by
sharing
her
experiences
with
her
friends
and
family
online
she
would
write
blog
posts
and
update
her
social
media
with
words
of
encouragement
and
positivity
this
made
her
realize
that
despite
her
struggles
she
had
the
power
to
bring
hope
and
joy
to
the
lives
of
those
around
her
this
experience
taught
her
and
the
rest
of
us
the
importance
of
having
a
good
attitude
even
during
difficult
times
staying
positive
even
in
the
face
of
adversity
can
be
incredibly
empowering
and
can
generate
feelings
of
hope
and
strength
it
can
also
help
to
put
our
own
challenges
into
perspective
and
can
often
open
the
door
to
new
opportunities
having
a
good
attitude
even
when
times
are
tough
can
bring
light
and
harmony
to
our
lives
there
is
no
definitive
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
attending
classes
in
school
or
from
home
is
the
better
choice
each
method
of
learning
comes
with
its
own
advantages
and
drawbacks
attending
classes
in
person
has
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
socialize
and
network
with
peers
in
addition
to
the
formal
education
it
can
also
be
easier
to
understand
complex
concepts
via
direct
instruction
from
an
experienced
teacher
as
well
as
the
ability
to
get
immediate
responses
to
any
questions
asked
on
the
other
hand
school based
learning
can
be
time
consuming
and
costly
additionally
it
can
be
difficult
to
stay
focused
when
learning
in
a
classroom
setting
due
to
the
distractions
of
other
students
on
the
other
hand
attending
classes
virtually
can
offer
more
flexibility
and
convenience
students
can
learn
at
their
own
pace
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
as
well
as
from
various
locations
furthermore
because
virtual
classes
are
more
cost
effective
they
may
also
offer
the
chance
to
save
money
on
tuition
and
transportation
costs
on
the
downside
it
can
be
more
challenging
to
stay
motivated
without
the
in person
energy
and
capacity
for
interaction
with
a
teacher
and
peers
in
addition
technical
issues
may
arise
during
virtual
classes
such
as
low quality
audio
or
video
in
the
end
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
attend
classes
in
person
or
virtually
will
depend
on
the
individual
s
preference
and
lifestyle
both
methods
of
learning
come
with
their
own
benefits
and
drawbacks
and
it
is
important
to
consider
both
before
making
a
decision
graduating
high
school
a
year
early
can
be
an
attractive
option
for
some
students
on
one
hand
it
can
represent
a
unique
opportunity
to
gain
a
head
start
on
college
or
other
post secondary
pursuits
such
as
joining
the
workforce
or
travel
however
taking
this
route
may
entail
certain
sacrifices
for
the
student
there
can
be
fewer
opportunities
to
explore
clubs
sports
or
extracurricular
activities
than
would
be
available
by
staying
all
four
years
the
fast tracked
schedule
might
also
make
it
more
difficult
to
build
long term
relationships
and
gain
a
strong
sense
of
community
within
their
high
school
for
parents
there
may
be
more
financial
stress
associated
with
their
child
finishing
school
earlier
they
may
also
have
to
find
more
creative
ways
to
structure
the
remainder
of
their
child
s
teen
years
for
teachers
the
loss
of
a
student
a
year
ahead
of
their
peers
can
have
a
disruptive
effect
they
may
need
to
modify
their
teaching
to
bridge
the
gap
finally
the
school
itself
may
be
affected
if
the
structure
of
the
student
s
curriculum
along
with
the
selection
of
courses
in
which
the
student
participates
can
not
be
replaced
on
short
notice
in
general
graduating
high
school
a
year
early
will
require
individuals
and
the
school
to
do
thoughtful
planning
with
potential
benefits
and
disadvantages
it
s
time
to
start
my
journey
into
i
ve
downloaded
the
game
and
sent
friend
requests
to
all
my
classmates
so
that
we
can
compete
with
each

and
learn
from
each

i
m
exploring
the
in game
mechanics
and
tactics
by
observing
other
players
and
experimenting
in
mode
with
different
strategies
like
building
to
defend
against
opponents
forming
teams
and
challenging
others
in
free for all
battles
to
further
enhance
my
skills
i
m
watching
tutorials
to
gain
tips
and
tricks
i
m
starting
to
understand
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
good
at
without
practicing
retakes
something
i
m
definitely
going
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
administrators
have
proposed
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
and
having
a
four
day
school
week
if
implemented
this
change
could
have
several
potential
consequences
for
students
teachers
and
schools
and
foremost
most
students
would
likely
oppose
this
idea
due
to
the
extended
time
spent
in
school
each
day
along
with
the
weekends
no
longer
being
a
block
of
days
to
catch
up
on
assignments
and
prepare
for
tests
the
extra
time
might
place
more
stress
on
students
negatively
affecting
their
mental
health
in
addition
this
might
lead
to
more
absences
from
school
due
to
fatigue
and
poorer
academic
performance
as
a
result
of
the
extended
day
for
teachers
this
type
of
schedule
could
mean
that
more
planning
and
preparation
for
classes
would
need
to
be
done
to
make
the
two
extra
hours
meaningful
and
worthwhile
this
additional
planning
might
pose
a
challenge
for
some
teachers
and
could
lead
to
burnout
the
additional
time
for
instruction
might
lead
to
more
frequent
lesson
plans
and
the
need
for
additional
grading
and
feedback
from
the
teachers
in
terms
of
schools
implementing
a
four day
week
and
extended
day
schedule
could
have
some
potential
logistical
issues
would
need
to
ensure
that
enough
buses
are
available
for
the
extended
route
times
along
with
the
management
of
cafeteria
routines
student
drop off
and
pick up
times
and
the
coordination
of
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
extending
the
school
day
to
two
more
hours
and
having
a
four
day
school
week
could
have
significant
consequences
for
students
teachers
and
schools
although
there
could
be
some
advantages
to
this
type
of
scheduling
change
school
administrators
need
to
carefully
consider
all
of
the
potential
issues
before
moving
forward
i
have
always
agreed
with
s
statement
that
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
losing
enthusiasm
and
i
stand
by
that
sentiment
failure
is
a
natural
and
inevitable
part
of
life
and
no
journey
of
success
can
be
made
without
encountering
failure
along
the
way
in
fact
learning
from
our
mistakes
is
one
of
the
most
important
components
of
success
through
our
failures
we
find
the
strength
and
determination
to
keep
pushing
forward
towards
our
goals
with
enthusiasm
rather
than
let
failure
be
a
source
of
discouragement
we
must
use
it
as
a
stepping
stone
towards
greater
success
i
strive
to
stay
enthusiastic
even
in
the
face
of
difficulty
because
i
understand
that
i
am
growing
and
learning
in
the
process
this
positive
attitude
allows
me
to
take
risks
and
try
new
approaches
which
can
ultimately
lead
to
great
success
in
conclusion
was
right
when
he
said
that
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
losing
enthusiasm
by
viewing
failure
not
as
an
obstacle
but
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
we
can
find
the
courage
and
perseverance
necessary
to
stay
on
the
course
of
success
making
a
good
first
impression
is
incredibly
important
in
many
aspects
of
life
it
can
have
an
immense
impact
on
the
way
people
perceive
us
and
how
we
feel
about
ourselves
it
is
often
said
that
you
never
get
a
second
chance
to
make
a
first
impression
by
making
a
good
first
impression
we
can
gain
respect
and
trust
from
others
make
new
friends
and
even
open
up
opportunities
for
ourselves
a
good
first
impression
could
also
help
to
create
a
lasting
impression
that
could
benefit
us
in
the
future
for
instance
in
any
job
interview
you
will
have
one
shot
to
make
your
first
impression
count
and
if
successful
can
lead
to
a
great
job
opportunity
in
addition
to
helping
in
professional
contexts
making
a
good
first
impression
will
also
have
a
great
impact
on
our
personal
lives
it
could
be
the
difference
in
someone
wanting
to
be
our
friend
or
not
talk
to
us
again
it
can
also
make
us
more
confident
in
social
situations
and
give
us
better
self esteem
all
in
all
first
impressions
are
vital
and
making
a
good
one
can
have
great
impacts
on
our
lives
from
job
opportunities
to
relationships
a
good
first
impression
is
the
key
to
success
advocates
of
outdoor
activities
argue
that
there
are
countless
physical
and
mental
health
benefits
to
be
found
in
taking
part
in
activities
such
as
riding
a
bicycle
playing
sports
or
going
for
a
walk
studies
show
that
active
outdoor
exercise
releases
endorphins
improving
our
mood
and
reducing
feelings
of
depression
additionally
regular
cardiovascular
activities
such
as
cycling
and
jogging
can
reduce
the
risk
of
both
heart
disease
and
diabetes
even
something
as
simple
as
a
brisk
walk
can
help
reduce
stress
and
promote
better
sleep
ultimately
outdoor
activities
can
help
us
lead
healthier
happier
lives
break
is
an
important
part
of
the
educational
system
students
receive
a
much
needed
break
from
their
hectic
schedules
and
have
the
opportunity
to
spend
quality
time
with
family
and
friends
yet
there
are
some
who
believe
this
break
should
be
shorter
to
maximize
learning
opportunities
however
i
believe
that
summer
break
should
remain
as
it
is
and
this
essay
will
explain
why
currently
summer
break
lasts
about
to
weeks
beginning
in
and
ending
in
for
students
who
have
had
to
work
hard
in
school
throughout
the
year
this
break
provides
a
chance
to
rest
and
recharge
it
allows
students
to
rest
after
a
stressful
year
and
enjoy
the
summer
months
with
family
and
friends
additionally
if
the
summer
break
is
preserved
students
can
also
have
more
time
to
pursue
personal
interests
and
relax
as
well
as
engage
in
activities
that
can
help
them
stay
engaged
and
healthy
aside
from
providing
physical
rest
keeping
the
length
of
summer
break
as
it
is
gives
students
more
time
to
nurture
their
social
relationships
during
this
period
students
can
build
and
strengthen
family
and
peer
relationships
studies
show
that
strong
family
and
friend
relationships
are
essential
to
better
mental
health
with
more
time
over
the
summer
months
students
can
explore
different
interests
and
volunteer
in
the
community
in
conclusion
summer
break
should
remain
in
its
current
length
with
longer
breaks
students
can
benefit
from
getting
much
needed
rest
from
a
long
academic
year
and
also
foster
strong
family
and
friend
connections
additionally
they
can
explore
their
interests
and
volunteer
in
the

purposes
comes
with
both
pros

cons
on
the
positive
side
cell
phones
provide
students
with
instant
access
to
the

allowing
them
to
easily
search
for

additionally
many
online
educational
resources
can

hand
cell

can
be
a
major
distraction
pulling
students
attention
away
from
the

at
hand
additionally
they
can
be
used
for
cyberbullying
contributing
to
an

computers
offer
a

however
they
may
not

can
lead
to
disruption
distractions
and
even
misuse
of
technology
leading
to
a
decline
in
educational
outcomes
respect
is
a
fundamental
part
of
building
strong
relationships
and
something
that
should
be
demonstrated
in
our
everyday
interactions
here
are
three
ways
to
demonstrate
respect
listen
actively
and
without
judgment
is
a
sign
of
respect
because
it
shows
you
are
interested
in
and
value
the
other
person
s
opinion
treat
everyone
equally
this
means
having
no
double
standards
and
treating
people
with
the
same
level
of
politeness
and
courtesy
regardless
of
their
position
or
status
empathy
it
is
important
to
take
the
time
to
show
understanding
for
the
feelings
and
emotions
of
others
even
if
you
don
t
necessarily
agree
with
them
demonstrating
respect
is
important
because
it
not
only
strengthens
relationships
but
also
makes
a
person
more
self aware
and
helps
build
confidence
in
a
work
or
school
environment
respect
can
lead
to
a
more
positive
and
productive
atmosphere
and
establishes
trust
amongst
colleagues
respect
for
others
leads
to
respect
for
ourselves
turning
into
a
virtuous
cycle
recent
research
has
shown
that
the
academic
performance
of
students
using
off campus
education
has
generally
been
less
than
students
in
an
on campus
environment
education
homeschooling
and
video
conference
classes
all
have
been
shown
to
cause
a
greater
likelihood
of
cheating
and
distraction
students
who
learning
off campus
have
rarely
gained
the
same
kind
of
socialization
benefits
that
an
in person
setting
can
impart
all
of
these
factors
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
when
it
comes
to
achieving
the
best
academic
results
an
on campus
environment
is
generally
more
effective
than
remote
learning
attending
classes
from
home
online
or
by
video
conference
has
many
potential
benefits
for
example
it
eliminates
the
need
for
students
to
physically
attend
a
class
on
campus
saving
time
and
money
associated
with
traveling
and
living
on
campus
it
also
gives
students
more
flexibility
as
lectures
and
course
materials
can
be
accessed
and
reviewed
at
any
time
rather
than
conforming
to
the
constraints
imposed
by
physical
class
schedules
however
online
or
video
conference
classes
come
with
some
limitations
for
one
it
can
be
more
difficult
to
stay
engaged
and
attentive
when
classes
are
held
in
a
non traditional
environment
additionally
students
may
find
it
more
difficult
to
connect
and
collaborate
with
peers
as
there
is
no
face to face
interaction
overall
i
believe
that
classes
from
home
online
or
by
video
conference
should
be
available
for
all
students
even
though
there
are
some
minor
drawbacks
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
access
classes
on
their
own
schedule
and
in
their
own
space
makes
this
an
ideal
option
for
students
who
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
latest
educational
opportunities
in
recent
years
many
high
schools
and
education
programs
have
been
created
with
the
aim
of
helping
students
find
a
career oriented
path
and
set
them
up
for
a
successful
future
making
a
commitment
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
have
some
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
one
hand
having
a
plan
in
place
for
what
you
want
to
do
for
a
living
can
provide
focus
and
drive
for
young
students
as
they
complete
their
high
school
studies
having
the
structure
and
guidance
to
decide
on
a
future
career
can
give
young
people
the
tools
they
need
to
ensure
a
successful
outcome
on
the
other
hand
making
a
commitment
to
a
particular
career
at
a
young
age
can
limit
a
person
s
options
and
be
restrictive
in
terms
of
open
exploration
and
research
the
greatest
advantage
of
career oriented
programs
and
high
schools
is
that
it
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
better
prepare
for
life
after
graduation
it
allows
them
to
explore
potential
career
paths
and
gain
experience
and
knowledge
in
their
chosen
field
which
can
dramatically
increase
their
chances
of
finding
a
job
and
achieving
their
future
goals
additionally
these
schools
and
programs
can
also
provide
valuable
connections
and
networking
opportunities
which
can
be
invaluable
to
young
people
seeking
employment
in
recent
years
technology
has
made
a
major
impact
on
our
lives
in
some
ways
it
has
been
a
blessing
allowing
us
to
stay
connected
with
friends
and
family
from
around
the
world
while
also
increasing
our
access
to
knowledge
and
resources
however
there
have
been
some
downside
effects
too
has
been
linked
to
loneliness
and
isolation
as
people
use
it
to
replace
face to face
interactions
in
addition
some
worry
that
an
over reliance
on
technology
has
made
us
lazy
and
less
capable
of
making
decisions
for
ourselves
technology
has
also
had
a
major
impact
on
employment
with
some
jobs
becoming
automated
due
to
advances
in
technology
and
the
development
of
this
has
created
economic
volatility
as
jobs
become
more
scarce
and
wages
become
harder
to
come
by
the
use
of
technology
while
driving
can
also
prove
to
be
a
dangerous
prospect
distraction
caused
by
cell
phones
and
navigation
systems
which
have
become
more
integrated
into
cars
can
lead
to
serious
accidents
technology
has
also
had
a
big
impact
on
warfare
in
recent
years
advances
in
drone
and
satellite
technology
have
allowed
militaries
to
better
identify
targets
and
direct
troops
in
the
battlefield
this
has
given
them
a
tactical
advantage
when
engaging
enemies
on
the
modern
battlefield
since
becoming
a
freshman
i
have
been
aware
of
the
importance
of
my
education
i
have
worked
hard
to
complete
the
required
course
work
each
year
while
at
the
same
time
reviewing
the
classes
i
would
be
taking
i
have
kept
in
close
contact
with
my
counselor
discussing
my
class
load
and
whether
or
not
i
could
take
on
any
additional
classes
during
all
of
my
classes
i
have
worked
hard
to
pay
attention
and
take
notes
to
ensure
that
i
understand
the
material
being
taught
overall
i
have
strived
to
complete
any
assigned
work
outside
of
class
and
to
turn
it
in
on
time
if
there
has
been
any
confusion
or
question
i
have
been
proactive
in
visiting
my
teachers
during
their
office
hours
to
get
the
additional
help
i
needed
in
the
modern
era
the
advent
of
technology
has
seen
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
ease
and
prevalence
of
human
contact
we
now
have
the
ability
to
connect
with
people
in
a
matter
of
seconds
at
any
time
of
the
day
from
any
corner
of
the
world
on
the
one
hand
this
has
been
highly
beneficial
in
areas
such
as
work
relationships
learning
media
health
care
and
security
in
work
it
allows
us
to
interact
with
coworkers
better
with
relationships
it
has
made
communication
simpler
and
learning
has
been
enhanced
through
the
use
of
online
tools
in
media
technology
has
provided
us
with
an
increased
variety
of
ways
to
connect
with
one
another
while
in
health
care
it
has
enabled
us
to
access
medical
information
and
treatments
more
quickly
and
securely
however
technology
has
also
had
a
somewhat
paradoxical
effect
on
human
contact
it
has
caused
people
to
become
dependent
on
it
leading
to
decreased
physical
interaction
and
even
an
increase
in
social
isolation
technology
can
also
be
used
in
dishonest
ways
to
spread
misinformation
and
even
cyber attacks
as
technology
continues
to
advances
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
the
positive
and
negative
implications
of
increased
use
on
our
lives
humans
are
by
nature
inquisitive
and
independent
and
the
ability
to
make
their
own
decisions
is
essential
to
growth
and
development
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
key
to
developing
a
sense
of
self efficacy
and
internal
locus
of
control
when
we
make
our
own
decisions
we
become
responsible
for
their
consequences
both
positive
and
negative
and
the
lessons
that
we
can
learn
from
them
remain
with
us
also
requires
us
to
weigh
the
consequences
of
different
options
in
order
to
choose
the
one
that
is
most
advantageous
this
helps
foster
logical
and
rational
thinking
problem solving
skills
and
the
ability
to
make
objective
decisions
which
are
all
important
steps
for
personal
growth
additionally
our
own
decisions
allow
us
to
understand
how
we
are
in
control
of
our
own
destiny
and
to
learn
the
importance
of
taking
responsibility
for
what
we
do
by
embracing
autonomy
complexity
and
responsibility
we
become
better
able
to
use
our
own
judgment
and
creativity
to
solve
challenges
identify
goals
and
set
achievable
objectives
this
is
how
we
truly
start
to
take
control
of
our
lives
and
reach
our
potential
as
self fulfilled
independent
individuals
ultimately
the
power
of
taking
our
own
decisions
gives
us
a
greater
sense
of
confidence
strength
and
individualism
and
is
essential
for
becoming
mentally
and
emotionally
healthy
as
well
as
achieving
our
personal
goals
achieving
goals
is
a
crucial
component
of
building
self esteem
when
we
set
and
achieve
goals
we
gain
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
confidence
that
encourages
us
to
strive
for
more
this
builds
our
self respect
which
in
turn
strengthens
our
sense
of
self worth
striving
for
meaningful
goals
and
having
the
desire
to
challenge
ourselves
can
also
help
us
build
self esteem
it
s
important
to
be
realistic
and
to
strive
for
reasonable
goals
for
which
the
odds
of
success
are
high
for
example
if
your
goal
is
to
become
a
doctor
but
you
don
t
have
the
right
background
or
financial
resources
to
pursue
the
necessary
medical
training
then
you
may
want
to
consider
setting
smaller
goals
such
as
completing
a
degree
in
a
health related
field
in
any
case
the
key
is
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
on
achieving
the
goal
this
will
give
you
the
confidence
boost
needed
to
go
after
bigger
goals
in
the
future
at
the
same
time
it
is
important
to
set
goals
that
reflect
your
own
values
and
interests
this
helps
build
inner
strength
and
resilience
that
will
enable
you
to
cope
with
life
s
inevitable
setbacks
additionally
it
is
important
to
remember
that
even
if
you
don
t
reach
your
goal
it
is
ok
to
recognize
and
celebrate
your
individual
efforts
reaching
for
goals
and
seeing
our
progress
is
a
great
way
to
boost
self esteem
ultimately
if
you
strive
to
achieve
goals
while
maintaining
a
high
level
of
confidence
and
self respect
you
will
be
able
to
build
your
own
self esteem
this
in
turn
can
help
you
create
a
strong
sense
of
identity
open
up
new
opportunities
and
lay
the
foundation
for
long term
success
and
happiness
distance
learning
has
been
gaining
traction
in
recent
years
as
an
alternative
to
traditional
in person
classes
for
students
while
distance
learning
certainly
has
its
advantages
such
as
the
ability
to
learn
from
the
comfort
of
home
and
increased
flexibility
with
time
management
there
are
also
disadvantages
which
inevitably
come
with
it
one
of
the
primary
downsides
is
the
lack
of
the
social
aspect
of
traditional
schooling
which
can
lead
to
increased
stress
levels
and
a
lack
of
motivation
for
many
students
fortunately
there
are
ways
which
educators
can
accommodate
different
types
of
learners
for
instance
breaking
up
lectures
with
virtual
online
room
discussions
is
an
effective
way
to
promote
collaboration
and
communication
between
students
furthermore
introducing
more
interactive
elements
such
as
small group
presentations
could
help
reduce
the
stress
of
distance
learning
and
help
motivate
students
to
stay
committed
to
their
courses
overall
both
distance
learning
and
in person
classes
have
their
share
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
in
order
to
find
the
best
option
for
any
particular
student
it
s
important
to
carefully
consider
the
available
options
the
proposed
p m
weekday
and
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
has
the
potential
to
have
far reaching
implications
for
their
freedom
safety
and
well being
restricting
their
movements
after
a
certain
time
of
day
can
reduce
their
opportunities
for
participating
in
constructive
leisure
activities
and
introduce
the
risk
of
harm
to
their
safety
without
the
freedom
to
stay
out
late
during
the
weekdays
teenagers
may
experience
a
sense
of
restriction
in
regard
to
their
mobility
and
a
perceived
lack
of
trust
from
their
parents
to
make
safe
and
responsible
decisions
passing
such
a
law
could
also
have
negative
effects
on
the
public
safety
of
their
community
as
teens
may
feel
compelled
to
break
the
law
and
engage
in
risky
behavior
a
recent
study
conducted
by
the
analyzed
the
impact
of
curfews
on
teenagers
and
revealed
that
although
reduced
crime
was
seen
in
areas
with
curfews
a
sense
of
mistrust
between
parents
and
their
teenagers
was
also
observed
furthermore
it
was
found
that
teens
reported
feeling
less
supported
and
respected
when
their
parents
imposed
a
curfew
on
them
it
is
clear
that
there
are
both
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
introducing
a
p m
weekday
and
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
while
a
curfew
may
result
in
decreased
crime
it
is
important
to
consider
the
long term
effects
of
such
a
policy
to
ensure
the
welfare
and
safety
of
teenagers
it
is
essential
to
weigh
all
factors
carefully
before
deciding
to
pass
a
law
with
potentially
long lasting
repercussions
on
their
freedom
safety
and
well being
when
a
student
chooses
to
attend
classes
from
home
they
can
reap
a
variety
of
benefits
these
benefits
can
range
from
more
leisure
time
the
opportunity
to
sleep
longer
and
the
elimination
of
a
daily
commute
for
example
consider
a
student
who
is
attending
classes
from
home
due
to
the
current
pandemic
by
staying
home
they
are
able
to
sleep
in
longer
and
eliminate
the
need
to
take
a
bus
or
walk
to
and
from
school
with
more
time
to
sleep
a
student
can
stay
healthier
with
sufficient
rest
and
more
time
for
exercise
and
healthy
meals
additionally
with
the
distractions
of
school
removed
the
student
has
an
improved
focus
and
can
better
plan
their
time
of
course
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
attending
classes
from
home
like
the
potential
for
distractions
from
family
and
friends
as
well
as
feelings
of
isolation
from
classmates
but
with
the
right
balance
a
student
can
make
the
most
of
online
classes
and
find
success
cellphone
usage
in
school
can
introduce
a
variety
of
risks
for
students
with
access
to
phones
students
may
be
more
likely
to
engage
in
cyberbullying
as
it
is
easier
to
hide
and
spread
hurtful
comments
online
in
addition
the
risk
of
cheating
can
increase
as
students
can
access
answers
from
the
internet
or
exchange
information
among
themselves
quickly
and
discreetly
moreover
cellphones
can
be
a
distraction
making
it
harder
for
students
to
pay
attention
in
class
and
complete
their
work
with
all
of
these
risks
in
mind
it
is
clear
why
schools
should
not
allow
the
use
of
cellphones
allowing
for
such
an
activity
in
the
classroom
not
only
compromises
students
safety
and
attentiveness
but
also
encourages
a
culture
of
cheating
and
bullying
in
today
s
world
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
important
to
consider
our
identity
in
different
situations
the
concept
of
being
somebody
else
can
be
a
useful
tool
in
many
aspects
of
life
such
as
accomplishing
goals
avoiding
conflicts
and
even
adapting
to
different
environments
for
instance
in
the
political
unrest
between
the
current
and
the
democrats
changing
identities
could
help
to
increase
understanding
and
foster
relationships
we
can
also
look
at
the
example
of
service
agents
disguising
themselves
as
this
could
be
useful
in
diffusing
dangerous
situations
since
they
would
be
able
to
gain
insights
into
the
culture
of
the
environment
they
are
in
and
therefore
be
better
equipped
to
handle
and
work
around
such
conflicts
moreover
in
everyday
settings
changing
identities
could
help
us
to
adapt
to
different
environments
as
it
allows
us
to
gain
new
experiences
that
can
contribute
to
our
personal
growth
or
to
reach
our
goals
for
example
with
the
ability
to
become
somebody
else
we
are
able
to
open
ourselves
up
to
new
possibilities
and
meet
others
with
open
minds
as
such
there
are
many
benefits
of
being
somebody
else
at
times
we
can
use
this
to
our
advantage
to
reach
our
goals
avoid
conflicts
and
gain
insights
into
different
cultures
and
environments
it
is
important
to
consider
how
this
practice
can
help
us
to
foster
relationships
and
potentially
increase
understanding
in
a
world
of
instant
digital
connection
and
interaction
it
is
more
difficult
than
ever
to
remain
true
to
oneself
with
each
new
advancement
in
technology
social
norms
and
cultural
expectations
shift
alongside
it
forcing
us
to
constantly
adjust
to
the
influences
around
us
social
media
can
be
especially
challenging
as
users
are
often
encouraged
to
present
the
best
version
of
themselves
to
the
world
at
the
cost
of
authentically
expressing
their
true
feelings
and
beliefs
it
can
become
tiresome
to
constantly
keep
up
with
the
trends
and
comparing
ourselves
to
our
peers
can
begin
to
affect
our
self confidence
and
well being
this
need
to
appear
perfect
and
accepted
by
society
can
have
lasting
effects
on
our
self perception
and
can
impede
our
journey
to
discovering
our
true
identity
it
is
essential
to
take
time
away
from
the
chaos
of
the
world
and
to
remember
to
breathe
reflect
and
to
embrace
being
our
genuine
selves
the
key
to
facing
our
difficulties
head on
and
staying
centred
during
this
time
of
great
change
is
to
remember
that
despite
the
shifting
of
norms
it
s
completely
okay
to
be
ourselves
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
rather
than
four
has
numerous
advantages
that
should
be
explored
and
encouraged
for
many
students
graduating
high
school
early
not
only
reduces
the
amount
of
tuition
costs
required
but
also
provides
them
with
an
opportunity
to
get
a
jumpstart
on
their
college
education
or
pursue
a
job
in
their
desired
field
of
study
by
beginning
college
or
a
career
early
these
students
have
the
opportunity
to
start
growing
professionally
and
financially
sooner
giving
them
a
competitive
advantage
for
students
struggling
with
social
or
personal
issues
graduating
early
can
provide
them
with
an
opportunity
to
get
away
from
what
could
be
a
difficult
or
unfulfilling
four
year
high
school
experience
finally
leaving
high
school
early
also
provides
students
the
opportunity
to
explore
and
develop
new
interests
or
travel
abroad
which
can
be
a
very
beneficial
experience
in
terms
of
self discovery
and
personal
growth
at
the
same
time
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
can
also
come
with
significant
challenges
for
one
thing
graduating
early
requires
hard
work
and
dedication
and
high
achieving
students
may
have
to
work
hard
to
maintain
good
grades
and
stay
on
track
with
their
classes
additionally
since
three
year
graduation
is
not
as
common
as
four
year
graduation
those
looking
for
scholarships
or
other
forms
of
financial
aid
may
find
it
more
difficult
to
find
adequate
resources
additionally
students
may
feel
unprepared
for
the
world
that
awaits
them
upon
graduating
high
school
early
because
these
students
graduate
without
having
experienced
all
the
traditional
four
year
high
school
activities
they
may
miss
out
on
a
crucial
part
of
a
high
school
experience
despite
these
challenges
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
should
still
be
encouraged
due
to
the
numerous
benefits
associated
with
the
process
by
starting
college
or
a
career
early
students
can
get
a
competitive
edge
make
social
or
personal
progress
or
explore
new
opportunities
as
long
as
students
are
prepared
to
face
the
challenges
ahead
graduating
high
school
early
can
be
an
extremely
beneficial
decision
as
students
it
is
our
responsibility
to
give
back
to
our
community
this
is
why
i
advocate
for
the
requirement
to
perform
community
service
in
elementary
school
service
not
only
builds
character
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
but
also
provides
meaningful
life
experiences
that
will
stay
with
us
as
we
grow
and
pursue
our
goals
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
students
can
volunteer
at
a
shelter
help
with
food
drives
participate
in
neighborhood
clean up
days
or
mentor
younger
students
service
teaches
us
important
values
such
as
cooperation
teamwork
and
selflessness
it
helps
us
develop
leadership
skills
and
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
our
place
in
the
world
for
example
in
a
small
village
in
a
group
of
elementary
students
got
together
to
start
a
compost
bin
project
they
created
a
composting
system
that
was
easier
to
maintain
and
more
effective
than
anything
the
village
had
previously
done
through
their
actions
the
students
showed
leadership
and
inspired
others
to
help
make
their
community
a
better
place
this
real life
example
proves
that
community
service
not
only
benefits
the
community
but
also
strengthens
the
lives
of
elementary
school
students
who
take
part
in
it
in
conclusion
i
believe
that
making
community
service
a
requirement
within
the
school
curriculum
is
an
important
step
in
teaching
our
youth
invaluable
lessons
that
will
help
them
become
positive
contributors
to
our
society
by
investing
our
time
and
energy
in
community
service
we
can
bring
a
wealth
of
new
opportunities
to
our
communities
and
foster
a
greater
sense
of
belonging
my
personal
experience
with
self reliance
relates
to
my
college
decision
at
the
beginning
of
my
senior
year
in
high
school
i
had
to
decide
where
i
wanted
to
go
to
college
i
wanted
to
make
the
decision
on
my
own
without
relying
too
much
on
expert
advice
after
spending
months
doing
my
own
research
i
ultimately
decided
to
attend
my
dream
school
it
should
not
be
understated
how
important
self reliance
is
when
making
important
decisions
if
i
had
relied
too
heavily
on
the
advice
of
others
i
would
have
had
to
take
their
opinions
into
account
and
could
have
ended
up
attending
a
college
that
was
not
originally
my
first
choice
self reliance
gave
me
the
confidence
and
drive
to
make
the
best
decision
for
myself
at
the
same
time
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
pros
and
cons
of
making
decisions
independently
versus
relying
on
expert
advice
it
is
often
beneficial
to
seek
expert
opinions
when
making
decisions
as
they
may
be
able
to
provide
insights
and
resources
that
i
may
not
have
considered
on
my
own
overall
it
is
important
for
individuals
to
research
and
consider
the
facts
before
making
important
decisions
and
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
between
self reliance
and
seeking
expert
advice
my
personal
experience
in
relation
to
self reliance
is
evidence
of
how
it
can
play
an
important
role
in
life
decisions
first
impressions
are
a
vital
part
of
the
social
experience
people
often
draw
conclusions
about
each
other
from
first
encounters
in
some
cases
a
negative
first
impression
can
cause
a
person
to
be
viewed
in
a
less
than
favorable
light
and
can
lead
to
false
assumptions
about
one
s
character
fortunately
individuals
who
are
faced
with
a
negative
first
impression
can
take
conscious
steps
to
turn
things
around
one
way
to
improve
a
negative
first
impression
is
to
be
friendly
and
engaging
even
when
the
other
party
may
not
be
this
often
helps
to
break
the
ice
and
can
create
a
sense
of
trust
between
both
parties
additionally
it
is
important
to
remain
aware
of
one
s
body
language
and
facial
expressions
confident
body
language
can
help
demonstrate
openness
to
engaging
in
conversation
while
a
sour
or
displeased
demeanor
can
give
off
a
negative
impression
lastly
a
person
can
display
an
understanding
and
consideration
through
their
words
and
actions
to
help
move
away
from
a
negative
first
impression
this
can
involve
actively
listening
and
responding
honestly
and
genuinely
take
the
case
of
who
was
viewed
as
gruff
and
abrasive
upon
his
first
introduction
to
the
team
through
actively
engaging
with
his
team
members
and
displaying
a
more
understanding
attitude
in
conversations
eventually
became
well
liked
and
respected
by
everyone
ultimately
it
is
possible
to
transfer
a
negative
first
impression
through
conscious
effort
and
dedication
people
should
approach
these
situations
with
self awareness
and
a
willingness
to
make
a
genuine
effort
to
break
the
ice
and
come
to
mutual
understanding
with
the
right
perspective
and
actions
any
negative
first
impression
can
be
turned
around
in
recent
years
the
question
of
whether
students
should
be
allowed
to
use
cellphones
in
the
classroom
has
become
increasingly
prominent
has
shown
that
when
used
responsibly
and
in
moderation
cellphones
can
benefit
students
in
their
education
by
providing
easy
access
to
online
resources
facilitating
collaboration
and
helping
students
remember
tasks
and
deadlines
additionally
studies
have
shown
that
students
are
more
engaged
and
have
higher
levels
of
satisfaction
when
their
teachers
utilize
technology
in
the
classroom
however
cellphones
can
also
be
a
distraction
in
the
classroom
environment
leading
students
to
check
their
social
media
play
games
and
text
message
instead
of
paying
attention
to
the
teacher
furthermore
the
privacy
risks
associated
with
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
in
class
are
a
matter
of
great
concern
as
such
it
is
important
for
teachers
and
administrators
to
take
into
account
the
implications
of
allowing
student
to
use
their
phones
during
class
and
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
doing
so
on
the
one
hand
it
can
be
beneficial
if
used
appropriately
on
the
other
it
can
be
disruptive
if
abused
ultimately
it
is
up
to
each
school
to
determine
if
allowing
student
to
use
cellphones
during
class
is
beneficial
or
detrimental
to
the
learning
environment
distance
learning
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
recent
years
with
students
relying
on
technology
to
attend
classes
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
while
this
offers
many
advantages
such
as
the
increased
flexibility
for
students
living
far
away
from
a
school
there
are
also
some
potential
drawbacks
one
issue
is
that
students
may
have
difficulty
paying
attention
and
understanding
their
lessons
when
they
are
learning
remotely
additionally
many
students
experience
increased
stress
due
to
the
lack
of
assistance
from
teachers
in
the
online
environment
ultimately
the
pros
and
cons
need
to
be
weighed
in
order
to
determine
whether
distance
learning
is
the
best
option
for
the
student
using
cellphones
in
the
classroom
is
often
discouraged
due
to
the
high
risk
of
distraction
and
cheating
when
students
are
distracted
by
their
cellphones
they
lack
focus
on
the
lesson
and
struggle
to
engage
with
the
material
cellphones
have
the
potential
to
allow
students
to
make
inappropriate
comments
share
inappropriate
images
and
participate
in
inappropriate
behaviors
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
in
order
to
use
cellphones
responsibly
in
the
classroom
students
should
come
up
with
a
set
of
rules
outlining
how
and
when
cellphones
can
be
used
to
benefit
learning
by
establishing
clear
boundaries
and
expectations
for
cellphones
in
the
classroom
students
can
help
create
a
safe
and
distraction free
environment
that
enhances
learning
one
of
the
major
benefits
of
being
able
to
attend
school
from
home
is
the
increased
convenience
for
students
who
would
otherwise
find
it
difficult
to
find
the
time
to
attend
a
traditional
educational
setting
schooled
students
can
often
take
courses
at
their
own
pace
and
structure
their
daily
schedules
however
they
choose
without
the
need
to
be
tied
to
a
specific
school
day
or
class
hours
additionally
students
who
are
home
schooled
are
often
able
to
learn
in
an
environment
free
of
external
distractions
which
can
help
them
to
better
focus
on
their
work
however
home
schooling
can
create
some
potential
drawbacks
as
well
schooled
students
may
lack
the
in person
social
interactions
of
traditional
education
or
the
structure
of
the
school
day
which
can
lead
to
decreased
motivation
and
attendance
issues
additionally
home
schooled
students
may
also
struggle
to
gain
the
job
preparation
skills
that
come
from
a
more
traditional
learning
environment
such
as
becoming
comfortable
in
a
professional
atmosphere
building
good
interview
skills
or
networking
overall
there
are
both
clear
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
being
able
to
attend
school
from
home
it
is
important
for
potential
students
to
consider
these
before
making
a
decision
about
how
to
best
pursue
their
educational
goals
the
debate
as
to
whether
people
choose
their
own
character
traits
or
are
shaped
by
outside
influences
has
raged
on
for
centuries
on
the
one
hand
many
people
believe
that
individual
character
is
predetermined
and
largely
shaped
by
factors
such
as
family
upbringing
education
economic
status
and
other
societal
influences
on
the
other
hand
those
who
hold
that
people
can
choose
their
own
character
traits
point
to
free
will
and
personal
choice
as
the
deciding
factors
of
which
side
of
the
debate
you
end
up
on
one
thing
is
certain
the
interplay
between
the
environment
and
the
individual
is
complex
and
shaped
by
a
multitude
of
factors
genetics
family
society
and
culture
are
all
powerful
factors
in
shaping
a
person
s
character
and
some
researchers
have
taken
these
factors
into
account
in
their
studies
however
it
is
also
true
that
people
can
make
conscious
choices
that
affect
the
development
of
their
character
therefore
choice
also
plays
a
role
in
the
overall
formation
of
one
s
character
at
the
end
of
the
day
whether
people
choose
their
own
character
traits
or
they
are
shaped
by
external
influences
is
a
complex
question
with
no
definitive
answer
has
shown
that
both
factors
play
a
part
in
the
development
of
character
and
only
by
taking
into
account
both
environmental
and
individual
factors
can
we
fully
understand
the
role
each
plays
one
of
the
most
effective
ways
to
influence
others
is
to
set
a
good
example
by
one
s
own
behavior
having
the
right
attitude
and
exhibiting
the
right
behavior
can
go
a
long
way
in
influencing
those
around
us
it
is
also
important
to
be
sure
to
provide
accurate
information
when
providing
examples
as
this
will
help
to
build
trust
with
those
that
we
are
trying
to
influence
finally
face to face
communication
when
done
in
a
respectful
manner
can
be
a
great
way
to
provide
a
good
example
that
other
people
can
follow
by
setting
a
good
example
by
our
own
behavior
we
can
go
a
long
way
in
helping
to
positively
influence
those
around
us
over
the
past
year
many
students
have
shifted
their
learning
from
traditional
school
settings
to
distance
learning
from
home
while
there
can
be
benefits
to
this
new
setup
such
as
avoiding
the
hassles
of
a
daily
commute
and
allowing
students
to
pursue
activities
at
their
own
pace
there
are
also
drawbacks
the
effectiveness
of
learning
from
home
can
be
questionable
as
the
lack
of
direct
interaction
with
teachers
peers
and
the
campus
community
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
maintain
their
focus
on
their
education
parents
have
expressed
mixed
opinions
on
the
effectiveness
of
distance
learning
while
some
are
happy
with
the
convenience
of
at home
learning
others
believe
that
the
lack
of
personal
interaction
with
teachers
and
classmates
can
be
detrimental
to
their
children
s
overall
growth
and
development
ultimately
it
is
important
to
consider
that
distance
learning
may
not
be
the
best
option
for
students
in
all
cases
while
some
students
may
be
able
to
excel
in
a
remote
learning
environment
others
may
find
it
difficult
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
due
to
the
lack
of
direct
classroom
engagement
as
such
it
is
essential
for
parents
educators
and
students
to
carefully
evaluate
the
various
pros
and
cons
of
distance
learning
and
make
decisions
based
on
individual
needs
and
circumstances
extending
the
school
day
is
something
that
many
students
and
parents
alike
believe
would
benefit
education
however
there
is
an
equal
amount
of
evidence
to
suggest
that
it
is
ineffective
and
detrimental
to
the
quality
of
students
lives
increasing
the
amount
of
time
students
spend
in
class
could
cause
them
to
become
exhausted
and
resentful
of
their
education
for
starters
many
students
already
struggle
to
stay
awake
during
the
current
school
day
not
to
mention
trying
to
pay
attention
and
learn
if
the
school
day
was
lengthened
students
would
find
themselves
even
more
sleep
deprived
likely
leading
to
a
decrease
in
academic
performance
due
to
lack
of
focus
and
energy
in
addition
a
longer
school
day
also
limits
the
time
for
physical
activity
and
extracurricular
activities
which
can
have
profound
and
positive
effects
on
students
academic
and
social
development
another
cause
for
concern
is
that
it
may
lead
to
students
hating
school
many
teenagers
already
view
school
as
a
chore
that
needs
to
be
completed
without
clear
direction
adding
more
time
to
an
already
long
school
day
could
make
them
resent
it
even
more
thus
creating
a
negative
attitude
towards
it
in
conclusion
while
many
may
believe
that
increasing
the
amount
of
time
students
spend
in
school
can
benefit
their
education
the
facts
suggest
otherwise
it
can
lead
to
exhaustion
decreased
motivation
and
an
overall
hatred
of
the
educational
system
as
such
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
students
to
keep
the
school
day
as
is
in
today
s
world
where
early
career
development
is
essential
to
success
schools
are
being
tasked
to
provide
a
way
to
help
their
students
explore
the
different
career
options
out
there
having
the
access
to
local
companies
and
organizations
allows
students
to
engage
with
the
curriculum
in
a
meaningful
way
create
meaningful
connections
with
teachers
and
learn
important
problem
solving
skills
it
is
clear
that
having
these
resources
is
essential
in
the
development
of
every
student
s
career
path
introducing
students
to
local
companies
and
organizations
offers
a
real world
hands on
experience
for
them
to

the
opportunity
to
explore
the
different
professions
available
and
provide
them
with
important
problem solving
skills
it
is
essential
that
schools
think
carefully
about
how
they
can
provide
their
students
with
access
to
this
invaluable
resource
first
impressions
can
be
a
valuable
insight
into
someone
s
life
by
observing
how
someone
interacts
within
a
space
their
general
demeanor
and
attitude
and
how
they
present
themselves
one
can
immediately
begin
to
guess
at
their
personality
their
approach
to
life
and
even
their
living
circumstances
such
an
impression
of
another
person
could
provide
an
understanding
of
how
they
think
act
and
are
overall
comfortable
with
themselves
and
the
idea
of
responsibility
all
invaluable
information
that
can
be
gleaned
solely
through
the
first
glimpse
of
the
person
in
question
taking
those
observations
and
truly
understanding
them
can
be
the
first
step
in
forming
a
meaningful
connection
with
someone
living
an
active
life
and
a
lazy
life
provide
drastically
different
experiences
an
active
lifestyle
gives
the
individual
opportunities
to
experience
new
and
exciting
activities
going
to
the
gym
hiking
biking
joining
a
club
or
sport
and
providing
volunteering
services
are
some
of
the
many
experiences
one
can
gain
from
living
an
active
life
additionally
an
active
life
style
has
the
benefit
of
improving
physical
and
mental
health
as
well
as
establishing
a
strong
social
circle
on
the
other
hand
living
a
lazy
lifestyle
can
provide
the
individual
with
experiences
such
as
unwinding
and
spending
more
time
alone
binge watching
television
spending
time
gaming
and
sleeping
in
are
some
of
the
likely
activities
found
in
a
lazy
lifestyle
while
this
type
of
lifestyle
can
be
relaxing
it
often
does
not
provide
the
same
energy
levels
and
sense
of
accomplishment
that
living
an
active
lifestyle
can
provide
an
active
lifestyle
can
provide
more
diverse
experiences
while
a
lazy
lifestyle
can
provide
more
relaxing
and
less
active
experiences
however
both
lifestyles
have
advantages
and
disadvantages
active
lifestyles
often
require
more
energy
commitment
and
potentially
money
while
lazy
lifestyles
require
less
effort
overall
and
less
planning
ultimately
the
decision
of
what
type
of
lifestyle
to
pursue
is
up
to
the
individual
and
it
s
important
to
consider
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
each
before
making
a
decision
was
an
american
statesman
diplomat
and
founding
whose
meticulous
planning
and
diligence
were
hallmarks
of
his
successes
he
understood
that
careful
planning
and
taking
initiative
could
lead
to
greater
accomplishments
though
dedication
and
diligence
played
a
large
part
in
his
success
also
believed
that
experiences
shape
us
into
more
successful
knowledgeable
people
experiences
can
challenge
us
refine
our
capabilities
and
help
us
become
more
valuable
and
proficient
the
debate
between
whether
living
diligently
or
more
opportunistically
leads
to
greater
happiness
has
been
discussed
for
centuries
while
some
may
favour
the
latter
believing
that
open mindedness
and
curiosity
can
lead
to
greater
growth
as
individuals
the
former
may
argue
that
having
a
plan
and
executing
it
carefully
can
make
us
more
successful
independent
and
secure
ultimately
it
all
comes
down
to
individual
responsibility
as
to
which
approach
is
taken
and
that
diligence
is
important
to
strive
for
success
i
have
always
been
a
firm
believer
that
when
you
have
a
goal
no
matter
how
large
or
ambitious
it
may
seem
it
is
always
possible
to
accomplish
it
through
hard
work
and
dedication
this
is
something
i
have
seen
through
my
own
experiences
as
well
as
through
others
around
me
by
taking
small
but
consistent
steps
every
day
i
have
achieved
things
that
i
thought
were
impossible
when
i
first
set
out
to
accomplish
them
this
same
notion
can
also
be
applied
to
the
work
of
combating
racism
every
day
we
can
put
in
the
effort
and
take
small
steps
to
move
towards
our
goals
all
while
creating
lasting
change
that
can
be
done
by
attending
and
supporting
protests
for
reform
engaging
in
conversations
that
challenge
our
unconscious
biases
investing
in
black owned
businesses
and
educating
ourselves
on
the
histories
and
literature
of
different
cultures
all
these
small
efforts
can
go
a
long
way
in
creating
the
change
and
progress
we
so
badly
need
in
our
society
through
grit
and
commitment
towards
our
goals
amazing
things
can
be
achieved
even
if
it
may
take
some
time
whether
it
s
creating
a
more
equal
and
just
society
or
accomplishing
a
personal
ambition
each
and
every
day
offers
us
the
opportunity
to
work
towards
building
a
better
future
classes
provide
many
distinct
advantages
over
traditional
schooling
particularly
for
those
with
unique
family
circumstances
safety
concerns
or
medical
conditions
for
parents
who
travel
frequently
for
example
online
classes
give
their
children
the
opportunity
to
continue
their
education
while
on
the
road
in
addition
online
classes
allow
students
to
manage
schoolwork
in
a
safe
and
secure
environment
away
from
potential
threats
that
can
occur
in
traditional
classroom
settings
finally
for
students
with
medical
conditions
such
as
chronic
pain
due
to
autoimmune
diseases
online
classes
provide
a
more
comfortable
way
to
learn
as
they
can
be
adjusted
as
needed
for
increased
comfort
and
accessibility
in
conclusion
online
classes
offer
a
unique
opportunity
for
students
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
from
the
safety
of
their
own
homes
and
with
the
added
convenience
of
making
accommodations
for
medical
or
family
needs
as
they
happen
in
recent
years
the
use
of
online
and
video
conferencing
to
facilitate
education
has
become
increasingly
popular
this
type
of
learning
provides
students
with
the
ability
to
attend
classes
from
the
comfort
of
their
home
allowing
them
to
learn
in
an
environment
that
is
more
comfortable
and
suited
to
their
individual
needs
and
preferences
while
this
type
of
learning
can
be
advantageous
in
certain
ways
it
can
also
present
drawbacks
that
should
be
considered
one
of
the
primary
benefits
of
learning
from
home
is
the
flexible
nature
of
the
learning
environment
students
can
complete
their
work
when
and
where
it
is
convenient
for
them
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
develop
their
own
schedules
and
manage
their
time
more
effectively
additionally
online
courses
provide
students
with
greater
accessibility
to
materials
classes
and
educational
resources
than
would
be
available
without
online
learning
this
provides
students
with
the
ability
to
further
their
understanding
of
topics
and
stay
up
to
date
with
new
information
on
the
other
hand
learning
from
home
eliminates
many
opportunities
that
students
would
otherwise
have
when
attending
classes
in
person
students
may
struggle
to
maintain
their
focus
and
develop
connections
with
their
teachers
or
peers
due
to
the
lack
of
physical
presence
in
the
classroom
without
direct
human
interaction
there
can
be
reduced
understanding
or
even
confusion
in
regard
to
certain
topics
additionally
there
can
be
a
lack
of
motivation
and
drive
in
completing
work
or
engaging
with
tasks
schools
should
offer
this
type
of
learning
as
an
option
as
it
allows
students
to
engage
in
the
material
in
an
accessible
and
flexible
way
while
there
are
drawbacks
to
learning
from
home
the
advantages
far
outweigh
the
disadvantages
and
with
careful
guidance
from
educators
students
can
still
have
successful
and
beneficial
educational
experiences
recent
studies
suggest
that
providing
healthier
options
for
school
lunches
can
have
immense
benefits
for
students
replacing
the
burgers
fries
and
pizza
currently
offered
with
more
nutritious
meals
such
as
salads
protein rich
dishes
and
fresh
fruit
can
significantly
improve
the
concentration
focus
and
motivation
of
students
this
increase
in
energy
would
likely
lead
to
improved
academic
success
however
there
can
be
great
difficulty
in
getting
students
to
choose
the
healthier
options
many
students
may
prefer
the
regular
school
food
such
as
pizza
since
it
is
familiar
and
tasty
some
students
may
even
feel
that
the
healthier
food
choices
are
less
satisfying
and
require
additional
effort
to
find
the
ingredients
nevertheless
there
are
still
many
potential
benefits
of
providing
healthier
school
lunch
options
such
as
socialization
by
replacing
the
regular
options
with
healthier
more
nutritious
meals
students
can
also
socialize
with
their
peers
while
still
mastering
new
healthier
habits
lastly
healthier
meals
often
do
n t
cause
the
crash
that
can
result
from
sugary
fatty
meals
reducing
the
likelihood
of
students
feeling
sleepy
in
the
classroom
in
conclusion
switching
to
healthier
school
lunch
options
could
have
a
multitude
of
benefits
for
both
the
students
and
the
school
it
can
improve
academic
performance
lay
the
groundwork
for
healthier
habits
and
reduce
feelings
of
sleepiness
in
the
classrooms
as
such
it
is
highly
recommended
that
schools
consider
making
the
switch
to
healthier
options
doing
something
in
order
to
accomplish
one
s
goals
is
infinitely
better
than
doing
nothing
taking
action
however
small
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
grow
learn
and
become
more
capable
of
tackling
more
significant
challenges
by
strategizing
we
can
create
a
step by step
plan
designed
to
make
our
dreams
a
reality
stakes
become
more
manageable
and
our
options
become
clearer
opportunities
both
tangible
and
intangible
become
available
from
taking
some
steps
towards
achieving
our
desired
end
goal
these
opportunities
serve
to
further
our
ambitions
by
exposing
us
to
new
knowledge
and
networks
that
could
n t
be
gained
otherwise
by
doing
something
we
put
our
best
foot
forward
and
showcase
our
level
of
commitment
to
those
around
us
possibly
leading
to
new
and
exciting
opportunities
not
available
if
we
simply
stayed
still
ultimately
doing
something
also
aids
our
decision making
process
we
become
clear
on
what
we
want
and
the
steps
needed
to
get
there
over
analyzing
different
situations
can
be
overwhelming
and
paralyzing
but
by
taking
action
we
can
move
forward
and
gain
momentum
we
can
carry
with
us
all
in
all
doing
something
is
far
better
than
doing
nothing
as
it
allows
us
to
grow
and
capitalize
on
chances
to
further
our
ambitions
and
build
a
successful
future
attending
school
in
person
provides
students
with
a
variety
of
advantages
that
can
not
be
achieved
in
an
online
learning
setting
for
starters
attending
school
allows
for
the
development
of
key
social
skills
that
are
important
in
one
s
daily
life
such
as
communication
collaboration
and
problem
solving
in
a
physical
school
setting
students
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
these
skills
through
direct
interactions
with
their
peers
and
teachers
furthermore
the
face to face
classroom
setting
allows
students
to
actively
engage
with
the
material
in
a
meaningful
way
creating
a
memorable
environment
where
learning
can
take
root
in
contrast
online
classes
are
generally
viewed
as
a
solitary
learning
experience
with
no
physical
interaction
between
teacher
and
student
it
follows
that
without
direct
participation
in
the
classroom
setting
it
is
more
difficult
for
students
to
fully
understand
and
retain
the
material
additionally
students
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
understanding
of
the
material
through
in person
activities
such
as
group
projects
class
presentations
and
discussions
all
of
which
can
contribute
to
their
overall
success
in

provides
students
with
a
supportive
and
interactive
learning
environment
that
helps
lay
the
groundwork
for
a
strong
academic
career
for
these
reasons
traditional
school
settings
tend
to
be
more
beneficial
for
students
than
online

it
s
time
for
the

at
to

graduating
high
school
early
is
an
increasingly
common
option
for
students
with
an
advanced
academic
track
record
early
grads
are
faced
with
a
number
of
benefits
and
drawbacks
that
are
unique
to
their
situation
for
example
early
grads
often
get
more
homework
and
less
downtime
than
their
traditional
four year
graduation
counterparts
they
must
also
balance
increased
coursework
with
prestigious
higher
education
opportunities
as
well
as
other
life
commitments
graduating
early
also
comes
with
its
consequences
depression
and
a
sense
of
disconnection
from
friends
and
family
are
some
of
the
most
frequently
cited
drawbacks
of
graduating
early
furthermore
those
who
graduate
early
may
have
to
move
away
from
home
when
they
head
off
to
college
ultimately
the
pros
and
cons
of
graduating
early
should
be
evaluated
and
analyzed
on
a
case by case
basis
to
make
the
right
decision
it
s
essential
to
consider
the
student
s
individual
academic
and
career
goals
some
students
may
find
graduating
early
advantageous
but
others
may
realize
that
sticking
with
a
traditional
four year
high
school
experience
is
in
their
best
interest
when
it
comes
to
making
a
large
important
decision
there
are
a
plethora
of
resources
to
turn
to
for
advice
consider
consulting
with
close
family
members
trusted
friends
or
knowledgeable
mentors
these
people
may
have
already
gone
through
similar
situations
and
can
provide
insights
from
their
own
experiences
additionally
you
can
also
reach
out
to
peers
or
colleagues
perhaps
in
the
same
industry
or
who
simply
share
the
same
values
and
interests
finally
don
t
forget
to
tap
into
the
timeless
wisdom
of
personal
advisors
or
professionals
such
as
lawyers
counselors
or
financial
planners
they
can
provide
practical
guidance
and
advice
on
how
to
make
the
best
decision
for
you
studies
have
shown
that
first
impressions
can
vary
considerably
depending
on
the
context
for
example
in
a
job
interview
a
candidate
may
initially
make
a
strong
impression
due
to
their
impressive
qualifications
but
further
questioning
may
reveal
the
candidate
is
not
as
competent
as
originally
thought
in
comparison
the
first
day
of
school
may
be
less
about
the
competence
of
the
students
and
more
about
the
interaction
between
them
studies
show
that
first
impressions
on
this
day
are
heavily
based
on
non verbal
interactions
such
as
body
language
and
facial
expressions
therefore
while
initial
opinions
of
someone
may
be
based
on
appearance
and
behavior
first
impressions
can
quickly
change
based
on
the
context
of
the
situation
this
suggests
that
contextually based
first
impressions
should
always
be
considered
with
a
degree
of
nuance
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
is
a
feat
that
is
not
for
everyone
while
it
has
the
potential
to
save
time
and
money
it
requires
strong
planning
commitment
and
discipline
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
should
be
carefully
weighed
when
making
the
decision
to
graduate
in
three
years
the
key
to
successful
completion
is
making
wise
choices
in
elective
classes
as
they
can
help
students
become
more
creative
and
better
prepared
for
their
postsecondary
studies
and
future
job
opportunities
however
it
is
also
important
to
assess
the
impact
that
graduating
in
three
years
may
have
on
knowledge
retention
a
lack
of
knowledge
in
certain
areas
could
hinder
postsecondary
success
or
job
opportunities
planning
and
making
wise
decisions
in
the
early
stages
of
high
school
is
essential
to
help
ensure
a
successful
transition
into
postsecondary
studies
and
the
workplace
s
quote
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
can
be
applied
to
life
s
goals
by
setting
the
bar
high
we
can
exceed
expectations
and
achieve
our
goals
successful
people
set
goals
with
higher
standards
and
work
towards
achievement
those
who
struggle
often
have
a
negative
mindset
or
take
short
cuts
positive
thinking
can
be
an
important
step
in
helping
to
achieve
difficult
goals
focusing
on
the
end
result
and
having
a
strong
network
of
support
helps
individuals
to
persevere
one
important
technique
for
developing
the
traits
necessary
for
reaching
one
s
goals
is
to
form
a
plan
and
break
down
the
tasks
necessary
into
achievable
steps
the
practice
of
delivery
management
will
help
to
stay
on
course
and
focus
on
the
goal
additionally
having
a
clear
vision
of
what
success
looks
like
is
important
all
of
these
elements
help
to
create
a
positive
environment
where
one
can
focus
on
reaching
their
goals
overall
setting
the
bar
high
is
an
important
aspect
of
reaching
one
s
goals
with
the
right
environment
and
mindset
it
is
possible
to
achieve
one
s
greatest
ambitions
when
aiming
for
success
one
must
decide
whether
to
aim
high
or
to
aim
low
on
the
one
hand
aiming
high
can
give
people
the
ambition
and
motivation
to
work
hard
and
become
the
best
they
can
be
if
they
succeed
they
will
likely
gain
satisfaction
recognition
and
self esteem
however
this
method
may
lead
to
disappointment
and
discontent
if
the
aspirations
are
not
achieved
on
the
other
hand
aiming
low
may
lead
to
a
sense
of
comfort
and
complacency
in
reaching
more
attainable
goals
but
these
successes
will
not
be
as
significant
as
when
one
has
taken
a
risk
with
more
challenging
targets
in
conclusion
it
is
important
to
determine
a
reasonable
balance
between
aiming
high
and
aiming
low
having
ambitious
goals
encourages
us
to
challenge
ourselves
and
strive
for
better
while
aiming
low
enables
us
to
be
mindful
of
our
limits
in
order
to
set
achievable
goals
that
we
can
be
proud
of
facing
challenges
in
life
and
maintaining
enthusiasm
are
essential
for
success
challenges
are
often
seen
as
obstacles
and
can
become
discouraging
however
by
looking
at
them
in
a
different
way
they
can
become
interesting
and
exciting
facing
failures
can
also
lead
to
success
allowing
us
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
better
ourselves
however
giving
up
on
difficult
challenges
brings
the
risk
of
missing
out
on
potential
success
and
stunting
our
growth
maintaining
enthusiasm
and
striving
towards
success
despite
challenges
is
key
talking
to
multiple
people
about
a
difficult
situation
is
often
the
best
course
of
action
when
you
speak
to
just
one
person
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
they
can
help
you
since
they
only
know
what
you
tell
them
additionally
having
a
conversation
with
more
than
one
person
can
provide
you
with
a
diverse
range
of
perspectives
on
the
situation
through
hearing
different
viewpoints
you
may
gain
insight
that
can
help
you
more
effectively
address
the
issue
speaking
to
multiple
people
also
allows
you
to
create
a
support
system
that
you
may
not
get
from
talking
to
a
single
person
each
person
can
offer
a
unique
style
of
comfort
or
advice
based
on
their
personal
experiences
that
can
be
beneficial
to
your
situation
this
can
help
bring
to
light
possible
solutions
which
you
may
have
never
considered
on
your
own
as
well
as
reinforce
the
idea
that
you
are
not
alone
in
tackling
the
issue
overall
it
is
better
to
talk
to
multiple
people
when
dealing
with
a
difficult
situation
doing
so
can
provide
you
with
a
range
of
perspectives
create
a
support
system
and
give
you
more
insight
to
the
problem
ultimately
this
can
help
ease
the
burdens
that
come
with
a
difficult
situation
while
allowing
you
to
better
address
it
technology
has
seamlessly
integrated
itself
into
our
lives
the
positive
effects
of
technology
are
far
reaching
allowing
us
to
connect
with
friends
and
family
around
the
world
quickly
and
efficiently
educate
ourselves
and
become
more
efficient
in
the
workplace
however
technology
is
also
being
used
for
more
sinister
purposes
scammers
target
vulnerable
citizens
and
steal
money
through
sophisticated
cyberattacks
and
bullies
can
spread
malicious
gossip
about
people
that
can
impact
lives
through
social
media
the
way
we
use
technology
to
read
books
watch
tv
shows
and
videos
and
shop
has
changed
dramatically
over
the
past
few
decades
we
now
have
access
to
endless
entertainment
options
and
are
able
to
shop
from
all
over
the
world
or
even
our
own
living
room
with
ease
but
it
s
also
worth
considering
how
technology
affects
students
in
the
classroom
as
virtual
learning
becomes
more
common
students
often
find
it
difficult
to
stay
focused
for
long
periods
of
time
and
may
not
receive
the
same
level
of
guidance
as
they
would
in
a
physical
classroom
although
technology
has
its
advantages
it
is
essential
that
we
learn
how
to
use
it
responsibly
and
ethically
discussions
about
technology
should
not
only
explore
its
positive
applications
but
also
how
it
can
be
used
to
harm
others
we
need
to
be
aware
of
the
risks
associated
with
technology
and
ensure
appropriate
safeguards
are
put
in
place
furthermore
it
s
important
to
understand
that
technology
can
be
used
for
both
positive
and
negative
purposes
by
being
mindful
of
the
implications
of
our
actions
we
can
ensure
that
technology
is
used
safely
and
responsibly
in
today
s
society
it
is
increasingly
common
for
individuals
to
follow
their
own
interests
and
passions
rather
than
following
what
their
peers
do
not
only
does
this
demonstrate
their
uniqueness
but
it
can
also
help
them
reach
their
goals
and
dreams
in
life
this
can
be
largely
attributed
to
the
fact
that
when
people
choose
activities
or
interests
that
they
prefer
they
are
more
motivated
and
energized
to
pursue
them
plus
they
often
feel
more
connected
to
and
passionate
about
the
subject
which
leads
to
more
enthusiasm
and
effort
in
the
long
run
therefore
by
indulging
in
such
personal
interests
people
are
able
to
pursue
their
goals
better
and
with
more
focus
ultimately
it
is
clear
that
interests
and
trends
can
heavily
influence
people
and
allow
them
to
go
further
in
life
than
if
they
were
to
simply
follow
what
their
peers
do
famously
said
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
this
statement
is
certainly
true
in
the
case
of
himself
he
is
well
known
for
his
groundbreaking
discoveries
and
inventions
from
developing
the
theory
of
relativity
to
his
winning
work
on
the
photoelectric
effect
however
these
inventions
and
accomplishments
weren
t
the
result
of
mere
knowledge
or
memorized
facts
instead
relied
on
his
imagination
and
ability
to
think
outside
the
box
he
was
able
to
draw
connections
between
different
lines
of
thought
and
concepts
that
had
been
previously
considered
unrelated
or
incongruous
a
feat
enabled
by
his
strong
and
creative
imagination
additionally
s
ideas
were
not
limited
to
scientific
discoveries
his
humanistic
views
and
philosophies
on
life
were
also
formed
and
expressed
through
his
imaginative
powers
ultimately
then
it
s
evident
from
the
life
and
work
of
that
imagination
is
indeed
more
important
than
knowledge
learning
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
choice
among
students
and
their
schools
in
recent
years
due
to
its
many
potential
benefits
one
main
benefit
to
attending
classes
from
home
is
convenience students
do
n t
have
to
commute
to
school
so
they
do
n t
have
to
worry
about
long
travel
times
traffic
or
inclement
weather
in
addition
students
have
more
flexibility
when
it
comes
to
scheduling
and
are
in
more
control
over
the
pace
of
their
learning
this
can
be
especially
helpful
for
those
who
are
juggling
competing
commitments
such
as
work
or
family
obligations
furthermore
students
may
have
more
consistent
access
to
digital
resources
and
technology
from
home
which
can
help
to
supplement
and
enhance
their
education
overall
remote
learning
could
be
beneficial
for
many
students
that
said
school
administrators
should
take
care
to
consider
the
potential
disadvantages
of
this
type
of
learning
such
as
reduced
social
engagement
and
quality
of
teaching
before
deciding
whether
or
not
to
implement
it
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
was
asked
to
deliver
a
speech
in
front
of
my
entire
class
i
was
so
nervous
that
i
was
sweating
my
hands
felt
numb
and
my
heart
felt
like
it
was
going
to
pop
out
of
my
chest
any
second
even
though
i
knew
my
speech
by
heart
i
could
only
manage
to
utter
a
few
chaotic
words
before
the
entire
class
erupted
with
laughter
this
humiliating
experience
was
my
first
failure
and
it
taught
me
an
important
lesson
it
is
through
failure
that
we
learn
to
appreciate
success
failure
is
one
of
the
most
important
ingredients
of
success
the
same
speech
that
i
failed
to
deliver
in
high
school
left
me
determined
to
approach
my
next
public
speaking
engagement
with
assurance
and
grit
with
enough
practice
i
was
eventually
able
to
master
my
craft
and
become
an
accomplished
public
speaker
failure
should
not
be
seen
as
a
deterrent
it
should
be
seen
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
it
is
through
failure
that
we
understand
our
weaknesses
and
gain
insight
on
how
to
turn
them
into
strengths
whenever
we
achieve
success
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
is
only
because
of
our
hard
work
and
determination
in
the
face
of
failure
that
we
were
able
to
make
it
happen
without
failure
success
would
have
no
meaning
had
been
feeling
stuck
in
her
life
for
years
unable
to
find
the
motivation
to
make
a
meaningful
change
that
all
changed
however
when
she
heard
about
a
person
who
had
faced
similar
struggles
but
had
managed
to
turn
their
life
around
and
achieve
their
dreams
hearing
their
story
inspired
to
go
out
and
make
the
changes
she
wanted
and
the
results
were
astonishing
she
was
suddenly
filled
with
newfound
confidence
and
self belief
and
was
able
to
make
astounding
progress
in
her
life
realized
that
anything
is
possible
with
dedication
and
perseverance
and
she
was
so
glad
she
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
the
experiences
of
others

the
best
time
to
visit
a
state

is
during
the

typically
the
most
enjoyable
and
the

the
presence
of
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
can
create
both
positive
and
negative
consequences
for
students
on
the
one
hand
using
a
cell
phone
for
educational
purposes
can
be
extremely
beneficial
as
students
are
able
to
more
quickly
access
online
resources
such
as
textbooks
and
lesson
plans
they
can
also
use
apps
to
help
with
their
academic
performance
by
reinforcing
the
material
they
learned
in
class
or
connecting
with
peers
and
teachers
to
discuss
difficult
topics
on
the
other
hand
students
may
be
tempted
to
use
their
phones
for
non educational
purposes
such
as
messaging
friends
or
surfing
the
this
can
lead
to
them
being
distracted
and
not
paying
attention
to
the
lessons
resulting
in
lower
grades
and
a
decrease
in
productivity
ultimately
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
school
to
set
clear
rules
and
regulations
around
the
use
of
cell

in
the

excerpt
once
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
these
words
echo
the
importance
of
resilience
of
never
giving
up
in
spite
of
failure
whenever
we
come
up
against
obstacles
in
life
it
can
be
easy
to
accept
defeat
or
to
take
the
path
of
least
resistance
however
s
advice
helps
to
remind
us
that
true
success
comes
from
the
courage
and
strength
that
is
required
to
persevere
through
hardships
attending
a
regular
school
as
opposed
to
taking
classes
from
home
through
online
or
video
conferencing
offers
numerous
benefits
for
students
firstly
regular
school
settings
provide
students
with
an
array
of
social
learning
opportunities
not
only
will
students
have
the
chance
to
interact
with
their
peers
they
will
also
benefit
from
having
mentors
such
as
teachers
and
guidance
counselors
who
can
offer
guidance
and
support
on
a
more
personal
level
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
attending
a
regular
school
means
having
access
to
a
greater
range
of
learning
materials
and
resources
not
only
will
students
have
access
to
a
wide
variety
of
textbooks
computers
and
materials
needed
for
class
they
are
also
more
likely
to
receive
assistance
from
librarians
and
other
student
organizations
who
can
further
help
them
with
their
educational
journey
finally
attending
a
regular
school
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
get
involved
in
a
range
of
extracurricular
activities
not
only
can
these
activities
help
to
build
teamwork
and
leadership
skills
they
can
also
provide
additional
motivation
for
students
to
perform
well
in
their
studies
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
some
students
may
prefer
the
convenience
and
flexibility
of
learning
from
home
through
online
or
video
conference
classrooms
these
students
may
feel
more
comfortable
learning
in
an
environment
that
is
away
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
a
traditional
school
setting
and
may
also
be
able
to
access
materials
and
resources
that
are
not
available
to
them
in
a
physical
classroom
additionally
online
classes
can
often
provide
a
more
tailored
learning
experience
allowing
students
to
complete
their
work
and
assignments
at
their
own
pace
and
in
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
my
essay
will
be
about
a
situation
two
years
ago
when
i
was
a
junior
in
high
school
i
had
been
very
interested
in
the
school
s
theater
department
but
i
was
too
intimidated
to
audition
for
any
shows
i
knew
that
if
i
auditioned
i
would
likely
be
cast
in
a
smaller
role
and
i
was
afraid
i
would
n t
do
well
enough
i
talked
to
a
close
friend
who
was
very
passionate
about
theater
and
i
could
see
that
they
wanted
to
encourage
me
to
audition
but
i
could
n t
work
up
the
courage
to
actually
do
it
i
believe
the
reason
i
was
unsuccessful
with
participating
in
the
school
theater
productions
was
because
i
was
afraid
of
failure
and
i
did
n t
have
enough
confidence
in
my
own
abilities
my
lack
of
self confidence
kept
me
from
taking
action
and
kept
me
from
fulfilling
a
potential
passion
if
i
had
pushed
myself
to
step
outside
my
comfort
zone
i
believe
i
could
have
achieved
success
if
i
had
made
a
different
decision
two
years
ago
and
taken
the
risk
of
auditioning
it
is
possible
that
i
could
have
gained
a
greater
understanding
of
theater
and
my
own
skillset
in
addition
my
friend
would
have
likely
been
proud
to
see
me
giving
it
my
all
and
succeeding
instead
i
remained
in
my
comfort
zone
and
my
hesitation
to
take
the
risk
caused
me
to
remain
inthat
area
and
to
miss
out
on
an
amazing
opportunity
one
effective
strategy
for
remembering
to
pass
the
ball
in
soccer
is
to
focus
on
your
teammates
both
while
playing
the
ball
and
when
you
don
t
have
it
during
games
be
aware
of
potential
passing
options
from
the
moment
the
ball
is
kicked
this
will
help
you
make
the
right
decision
quickly
and
not
miss
out
on
chances
to
connect
with
teammates
additionally
try
verbalizing
the
pass
you
plan
on
making
before
you
make
it
this
will
help
you
develop
a
sense
of
mental
discipline
which
in
the
heat
of
the
game
will
help
you
decide
when
the
best
time
to
pass
the
ball
is
finally
it
s
important
to
practice
passing
drills
in
training
and
games
as
this
will
help

wise
words
aptley
remarked
that
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
it
is
true
that
we
must
put
ourselves
into
positions
of
discomfort
and
challenge
to
be
able
to
grow
both
professionally
as
well
as
personally
necessitates
venturing
out
of
the
comfort
zone
and
pushing
one
s
boundaries
so
that
we
can
be
open
to
different
ideas
and
inspired
to
make
an
impact
as
an
example
take
a
person
who
is
a
professional
web
developer
to
grow
as
a
developer
and
stay
relevant
in
the
everchanging
technological
landscape
they
must
take
the
initiative
to
learn
new
development
languages
or
explore
emerging
technologies
only
in
doing
so
can
they
truly
make
an
impact
in
their
field
on
a
personal
level
an
individual
might
be
scared
to
start
a
conversation
with
a
stranger
for
fear
of
being
rejected
or
misunderstood
by
taking
small
steps
and
actively
engaging
in
new
conversations
their
confidence
is
boosted
and
they
become
more
outgoing
with
every
new
person
they
encounter
they
are
able
to
learn
new
perspectives
and
become
better
communicators
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
to
step
outside
the
comfort
zone
and
push
our
boundaries
from
time
to
time
taking
calculated
risks
helps
individuals
truly
grow
and
become
better
versions
of
themselves
my
name
is
and
i
m
from
i
speak
english
and
and
i
m
currently
attending
the
of
to
me
community
is
incredibly
important
as
it
helps
to
foster
growth
and
collaboration
among
different
people
who
are
striving
to
reach
the
same
goals
being
part
of
a
strong
community
makes
me
strive
to
always
be
the
best
version
of
myself
whether
it
s
in
class
or
in
any
other
subject
i
might
be
taking
i
believe
that
being
a
good
student
not
only
benefits
me
but
also
the
rest
of
my
community
and
i
m
committed
to
taking
on
the
responsibility
with
enthusiasm
technology
has
become
a
ubiquitous
part
of
our
day to day
lives
but
how
we
use
it
can
have
a
considerable
impact
on
our
lives
there
are
many
ways
that
we
can
use
technology
in
positive
beneficial
ways
that
enrich
our
lives
and
create
opportunities
and
conveniences
we
can
use
technology
to
stay
in
touch
with
family
and
friends
to
wrangle
our
schedules
and
even
to
conduct
our
work
it
can
also
be
used
to
help
us
stay
informed
about
current
events
and
even
explore
and
learn
new
skills
it
can
be
used
to
store
memories
inspire
creativity
or
plan
trips
technology
can
even
enable
us
to
pay
bills
online
or
send
money
to
others
however
when
technology
is
used
in
the
wrong
way
negative
effects
can
result
too
much
information
can
easily
be
shared
online
and
people
can
be
victims
of
cyberbullying
or
identity
theft
people
can
become
reliant
on
technology
at
the
expense
of
relationships
face to face
interactions
and
physical
activities
people
can
unknowingly
browse
and
access
websites
that
may
be
harmful
or
disrespectful
to
others
in
conclusion
people
can
use
technology
in
positive
ways
which
can
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
and
opportunities
however
it
is
important
to
use
it
in
the
right
way
responsibly
to
avoid
the
negative
effects
that
can
result
from
using
it
improperly
sports
provide
a
multitude
of
benefits
to
students
that
extend
far
beyond
physical
fitness
participating
in
school
sports
allows
students
to
develop
relationships
and
establish
communication
skills
that
are
beneficial
long
after
they
graduate
studies
have
also
shown
that
students
who
take
part
in
school
sports
are
more
likely
to
have
higher
self esteem
and
are
more
focused
academically
sports
also
provide
a
sense
of
community
and
unity
among
students
teachers
and
parents
normal
school
activities
may
not
allow
for
much
interaction
between
all
three
groups
but
school
sports
are
a
great
opportunity
for
all
stakeholders
to
come
together
players
spectators
teachers
and
administrators
all
become
part
of
the
same
team
in
conclusion
there
are
many
benefits
associated
with
participating
in
school
sports
programs
therefore
a
change
in
the
school
s
sports
policy
would
be
a
disservice
to
the
students
the
teachers
and
the
parents
after
spending
some
time
researching
my
own
skills
and
talents
i
have
identified
a
few
that
i
possess
and
have
determined
ways
that
i
could
improve
upon
them
one
particular
skill
i
have
is
public
speaking
to
improve
this
skill
i
plan
on
taking
a
speech
class
with
a
focus
on
communication
techniques
i
was
also
surprised
to
discover
that
there
could
be
a
world
record
associated
with
a
skill
i
possess
after
a
bit
of
research
i
found
that
there
is
a
world
record
for
holding
the
most
books
in
one
hand
which
i
am
pretty
sure
i
can
beat
i
have
also
looked
for
ways
to
combine
skills
or
talents
that
i
may
not
have
thought
of
before
such
as
combining
public
speaking
with
musical
performance
this
type
of
performance
could
lead
to
exciting
opportunities
for
me
in
the
future
i
have
also
researched
how
i
can
become
better
than
others
in
the
same
fields
as
me
after
researching
potential
avenues
for
doing
this
i
have
found
methods
that
could
help
me
to
become
the
expert
in
whichever
skills
or
talents
i
may
possess
i
have
also
looked
at
ways
to
develop
any
new
skills
or
abilities
that
i
may
not
currently
possess
by
doing
this
i
am
opening
myself
up
to
new
experiences
and
opportunities
that
i
may
not
have
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
otherwise
with
the
possibilities
being
endless
i
am
excited
to
start
exploring
the
ways
i
can
improve
upon
and
add
to
the
skill set
i
already
possess
sports
and
activities
are
some
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
a
student
s
education
part
of
a
team
sport
or
an
activity
at
school
teaches
students
invaluable
lessons
in
teamwork
and
can
provide
them
with
essential
outlets
for
stress
and
anxiety
it
also
helps
them
stay
engaged
in
their
academic
and
emotional
lives
therefore
s
school
should
be
open
to
the
idea
of
allowing
its
students
to
participate
in
sports
and
activities
even
if
their
grades
are
currently
below
a
if
students
are
barred
from
participating
in
sports
and
activities
solely
due
to
a
lower
grade
they
could
end
up
feeling
isolated
and
de motivated
to
get
back
their
grades
giving
students
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
these
activities
will
encourage
them
to
strive
for
academic
excellence
it
will
also
show
them
that
the
school
is
there
for
them
to
support
and
encourage
them
not
just
to
reprimand
them
fostering
this
sort
of
environment
in
the
school
will
give
students
a
sense
of
belonging
and
purpose
that
will
ultimately
help
them
get
back
on
track
with
their
studies
play
a
vital
role
in
helping
kids
develop
and
learn
not
just
academically
but
also
socially
emotionally
and
morally
allowing
students
the
chance
to
participate
in
sports
and
activities
even
when
their
grades
are
below
a
is
a
crucial
step
in
creating
an
environment
that
encourages
students
to
achieve
their
best
both
inside
and
outside
the
classroom
working
in
a
group
offers
the
advantage
of
increased
efficiency
and
faster
completion
of
tasks
when
compared
to
working
alone
with
multiple
brains
working
together
and
communicating
ideas
tasks
can
be
completed
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
than
when
relying
on
a
single
individual
this
makes
group
work
ideal
for
problem solving
and
brainstorming
additionally
working
in
a
group
can
create
an
efficient
an
effective
environment
that
produces
thoughtful
results
on
the
other
hand
when
completing
simple
tasks
or
those
that
require
little
collaboration
working
alone
can
be
beneficial
working
solo
allows
a
person
to
work
at
their
own
pace
with
no
distractions
allowing
for
more
focused
and
uninterrupted
work
additionally
working
alone
can
help
to
develop
greater
self discipline
and
productivity
as
there
can
be
a
significant
lack
of
accountability
when
working
in
a
group
the
communication
aspect
of
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
is
an
important
aspect
to
consider
working
in
a
group
encourages
more
open
communication
and
better
understanding
between
the
members
this
helps
to
ensure
that
all
ideas
are
discussed
and
considered
in
order
to
reach
the
best
possible
solution
conversely
working
alone
can
lead
to
misunderstanding
and
can
limit
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
opinions
in
conclusion
it
is
important
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
both
working
in
a
group
and
alone
in
order
to
determine
the
best
method
of
completing
tasks
each
brings
its
own
unique
advantages
and
disadvantages
so
the
decision
as
to
which
is
more
beneficial
should
be
based
on
the
specific
situation
and
task
at
hand
doing
your
best
is
an
important
part
of
life
it
s
not
just
about
getting
good
grades
or
obtaining
a
job it
s
about
having
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
have
reached
your
full
potential
when
you
do
your
best
you
can
be
proud
of
your
achievements
and
use
them
as
a
stepping
stone
to
greater
success
or
happiness
in
the
future
additionally
trying
to
reach
your
peak
performance
has
a
positive
effect
on
your
mental
and
physical
health
when
you
do
your
best
you
are
using
all
of
the
tools
available
to
you
this
includes
developing
creative
problem
solving
skills
and
learning
to
use
the
resources
available
to
you
to
complete
a
task
you
are
also
learning
to
experiment
and
take
risks
in
order
to
reach
your
goal
this
process
helps
you
build
self confidence
as
you
are
confident
that
you
are
doing
the
best
that
you
can
finally
it
is
important
to
always
do
your
best
because
it
sets
an
example
for
others
and
helps
to
create
a
positive
work
ethic
it
is
inspiring
to
watch
someone
put
in
maximum
effort
and
achieve
great
success
when
you
put
your
best
foot
forward
you
are
leading
by
example
and
showing
others
what
it
means
to
strive
for
greatness
all
of
these
benefits
come
together
to
make
a
strong
argument
for
why
you
should
always
make
an
effort
to
do
your
best
at
our
school
we
have
developed
a
mentorship
program
that
pairs
older
students
with
younger
ones
through
this
program
older
students
can
help
younger
students
get
situated
for
the
school
year
helping
them
identify
their
classes
and
assisting
them
in
completing
their
assignments
this
program
provides
a
great
opportunity
for
older
students
to
develop
their
leadership
skills
while
the
younger
students
benefit
from
the
support
and
guidance
of
their
peers
we
believe
that
fostering
these
kinds
of
supportive
relationships
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
both
student
s
school
experiences
completing
science
experiments
in
school
can
be
an
engaging
and
educational
experience
not
only
do
students
gain
hands on
knowledge
of
varying
scientific
concepts
but
they
also
discover
how
to
use
scientific
techniques
to
reach
a
goal
but
for
some
students
science
experiments
can
be
intimidating
and
can
lead
to
a
negative
outlook
on
science
and
the
laboratory
it
s
essential
for
students
to
remember
to
follow
safety
rules
and
protocols
in
order
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
experiments
through
careful
observation
and
precise
measurements
students
can
gain
greater
awareness
of
the
scientific
process
far
from
simply
studying
the
facts
of
science
science
experiments
can
allow
students
to
understand
and
appreciate
scientific
relationships
in
a
deeper
way
not
only
can
science
enrich
a
student
s
intellectual
capacity
but
also
their
school
experience
working
in
a
group
has
many
benefits
that
can
outweigh
working
alone
firstly
collaboration
is
key
when
completing
a
task
having
different
ideas
from
other
members
of
the
group
provides
an
opportunity
to
explore
and
to
create
a
well rounded
outcome
working
in
a
group
allows
multiple
perspectives
and
approaches
to
be
discussed
and
weighed
up
the
range
of
knowledge
and
expertise
found
in
a
group
can
lead
to
better
decision
making
and
a
higher
quality
of
work
communication
is
also
improved
when
working
as
a
team
dialogue
and
discussion
can
ensure
that
everyone
is
kept
informed
and
that
any
misunderstandings
are
quickly
identified
working
in
a
group
also
allows
tasks
to
be
completed
at
a
faster
pace
with
people
able
to
specialise
in
certain
areas
or
to
take
on
specific
roles
finally
working
in
a
group
facilitates
understanding
in
ways
that
working
alone
does
not
members
of
the
group
can
provide
support
and
guidance
and
help
each
other
to
grow
in
knowledge
and
skills
working
together
can
also
create
a
sense
of
unity
and
solidarity
that
would
not
be
possible
in
an
individual
setting
in
conclusion
working
in
a
group
can
be
hugely
beneficial
for
many
reasons
including
collaboration
communication
faster
work
and
improved
understanding
with
the
rise
of
online
education
many
students
are
considering
taking
classes
online
instead
of
attending
traditional
classes
while
there
are
a
number
of
advantages
to
taking
online
classes
e g
the
ability
to
study
at
your
own
pace
and
the
convenience
of
not
having
to
physically
attend
classes
there
are
also
downsides
for
busy
students
having
the
freedom
of
self paced
learning
can
be
a
double edged
sword
since
it
requires
a
great
degree
of
discipline
and
self regulating
in
order
to
ensure
coursework
is
being
completed
in
a
timely
manner
additionally
for
students
hoping
to
enter
certain
professions
attending
traditional
classes
may
be
important
for
boosting
one
s
career
prospects
finally
while
there
may
be
time saving
benefits
associated
with
online
classes
students
may
miss
out
on
the
sense
of
community
and
social
activities
that
are
more
easily
available
by
attending
traditional
classes
ultimately
online
classes
may
provide
some
freedom
and
flexibility
to
students
but
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
tradeoffs
that
come
with
such
otherwise
convenient
learning
opportunities
according
to
recent
studies
allowing
students
to
bring
their
cell
phones
for
educational
purposes
in
the
classroom
can
have
detrimental
effects
on
their
learning
phones
often
become
a
distraction
leading
to
students
using
them
for
messaging
surfing
the
internet
and
accessing
social
media
instead
of
studying
this
behavior
can
lead
to
decreased
academic
performance
and
increased
time
needed
to
complete
assignments
additionally
bringing
cell
phones
into
the
classroom
can
disrupt
the
learning
environment
since
students
can
use
their
phones
to
document
the
lectures
classmates
can
be
concerned
by
privacy
issues
leading
to
feelings
of
mistrust
and
decreased
morale
phones
can
be
a
source
of
cyberbullying
even
if
students
do
n t
actively
use
their
phones
to
harass
their
peers
having
them
in
the
classroom
gives
people
the
tools
to
do
so
and
can
result
in
disruption
and
decreased
focus
on
learning
all
in
all
cell
phones
should
not
be
allowed
for
educational
purposes
in
the
classroom
the
potential
risk
of
decreased
educational
performance
decreased
learning
environment
and
cyberbullying
outweigh
the
potential
benefits
which
are
usually
quite
minimal
my
love
of
music
started
when
i
joined
the
school
choir
in
elementary
school
i
was
curious
about
different
types
of
instrument
and
soon
began
to
learn
the
recorder
xylophone
percussion
and
the
violin
as
i
practiced
and
explored
these
instruments
i
began
to
participate
in
musical
contests
concerts
and
any
other
opportunity
to
showcase
my
talents
my
hard
work
paid
off
when
i
became
the
leader
of
a
school
band
and
we
wrote
and
performed
a
song
for
an
important
event
i
was
proud
to
have
contributed
to
something
so
meaningful
has
been
a
passion
of
mine
ever
since
technology
has
become
an
inextricable
part
of
modern
life
and
its
implications
on
people
s
lives
have
been
both
positive
and
negative
on
one
hand
technology
has
enabled
us
to
connect
with
people
from
all
around
the
world
share
our
thoughts
learn
new
skills
acquire
new
knowledge
and
engage
in
a
variety
of
activities
that
were
once
considered
impossible
on
the
other
hand
this
heavy
reliance
on
technology
can
make
us
forget
how
to
truly
enjoy
life
for
example
many
people
feel
inadequate
because
of
the
curated
version
of
reality
presented
on
social
media
and
comparison
with
others
lifestyles
or
accomplishments
making
them
feel
disconnected
from
their
own
lives
potentially
leading
to
depression
and
other
forms
of
mental
illness
we
must
take
action
to
ensure
that
technology
is
used
in
a
productive
healthy
way
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
technology
can
have
an
adverse
effect
on
our
physical
and
mental
health
and
make
sure
to
take
regular
breaks
from
electronic
devices
in
order
to
relax
our
brains
we
should
also
make
conscious
efforts
to
understand
the
true
nature
of
reality
and
be
mindful
of
our
time
spent
on
technology
to
ensure
that
we
live
more
authentic
balanced
lives
famously
stated
that
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
this
idea
is
particularly
relevant
today
as
we
live
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
homogenize
individuals
and
force
them
to
fit
into
a
predetermined
mold
take
for
example
the
world
of
professional
sports
many
athletes
face
immense
pressure
from
the
industry
to
attain
a
certain
look
play
style
or
attitude
in
order
to
be
successful
there
is
a
pervasive
attitude
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
be
a
star
and
athletes
who
do
n t
fit
that
mold
can
be
easily
cast
aside
or
ignored
those
who
ultimately
succeed
are
those
who
have
managed
to
stay
true
to
themselves
and
their
unique
styles
despite
all
the
external
pressure
another
example
of
this
trend
can
be
seen
in
education
now
more
than
ever
before
young
people
are
placed
into
rigid
curriculums
and
systems
that
emphasize
conformity
and
orthodoxy
rather
than
individual
initiative
and
personal
growth
unfortunately
this
approach
often
leads
to
a
narrow
definition
of
success
and
achievement
that
fails
to
account
for
the
unique
qualities
of
each
individual
student
those
who
ultimately
succeed
in
this
system
are
those
that
have
managed
to
stay
true
to
their
own
passions
and
interests
regardless
of
what
standard
measures
of
success
may
dictate
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
s
idea
of
individuality
is
more
important
than
ever
and
that
success
depends
on
staying
true
to
yourself
rather
than
conforming
to
a
predetermined
mold
by
following
this
idea
individuals
can
achieve
greatness
and
make
meaningful
contributions
to
society
on
their
own
terms
growing
up
i
always
knew
i
had
to
be
my
own
person
my
parents
never
wanted
me
to
rely
too
much
on
them
or
on
others
so
they
taught
me
from
an
early
age
to
be
independent
and
self sufficient
i
learned
how
to
work
hard
and
take
responsibility
for
the
things
i
wanted
there
were
many
times
when
i
felt
like
giving
up
or
when
i
was
facing
a
difficult
challenge
but
i
learned
to
draw
strength
from
within
myself
when
it
came
to
the
challenges
of
being
myself
and
following
my
own
path
i
found
it
essential
to
practice
self care
this
included
getting
enough
rest
being
mindful
of
my
emotions
and
practicing
healthy
habits
i
also
leaned
on
the
support
of
my
friends
and
family
it
was
comforting
to
know
that
i
had
people
who
had
my
back
no
matter
what
path
i
chose
though
there
were
times
when
i
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
pressure
of
being
myself
i
eventually
found
the
strength
to
overcome
all
the
obstacles
through
dedication
and
hard
work
i
learned
to
accept
and
embrace
myself
for
who
i
am
i
realized
that
i
was
capable
of
facing
any
challenge
that
came
my
way
whether
it
was
the
challenge
of
striking
out
on
my
own
or
finding
a
career
path
of
my
own
choosing
i
learned
to
take
charge
of
my
life
and
be
independent
being
independent
gave
me
the
confidence
to
take
risks
and
go
after
what
i
wanted
in
the
end
learning
to
be
independent
and
following
my
own
path
has
been
one
of
the
best
decisions
i
have
ever
made
providing
students
with
the
option
to
complete
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
has
both
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
the
primary
motivation
for
this
type
of
program
is
to
give
students
an
academic
head
start
on
college
or
vocational
school
this
means
that
any
student
who
enters
the
program
with
the
necessary
qualifications
and
dedication
would
have
the
potential
to
graduate
from
college
faster
than
their
peers
on
the
other
hand
students
may
find
themselves
unprepared
for
the
speed
at
which
they
complete
their
education
and
may
have
difficulty
keeping
up
with
the
intensity
of
the
program
another
potential
disadvantage
is
that
the
year
program
limits
students
opportunities
to
explore
multiple
subject
areas
and
discover
their
interests
many
students
may
miss
out
on
learning
experiences
that
would
shape
their
further
education
or
life
paths
if
they
were
to
stay
in
school
for
the
full
four
years
the
modern
education
system
is
constantly
adapting
to
meet
the
changing
needs
of
students
with
a
greater
emphasis
on
student
outcomes
and
future
prospects
it
is
important
to
consider
the
impact
of
changes
to
school
hours
on
a
student
s
future
and
achievement
additionally
the
difficulty
which
some
students
may
have
in
adjusting
to
a
different
language
can
lead
to
bullying
in
school
and
consequently
result
in
a
lack
of
motivation
to
continue
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
students
are
provided
with
the
necessary
support
and
resources
to
begin
and
continue
their
education
while
also
being
able
to
study
and
work
concurrently
furthermore
the
effect
of
limiting
traditional
school
hours
needs
to
be
considered
by
conserving
energy
and
resources
such
an
approach
could
reduce
the
environmental
impact
of
education
though
the
consequences
of
such
a
shift
would
need
to
be
carefully
analyzed
when
it
comes
to
making
important
decisions
it
is
often
beneficial
to
seek
advice
and
ideas
from
many
different
people
sharing
ideas
with
others
can
open
us
up
to
different
perspectives
and
allow
us
to
think
outside
the
box
moreover
talking
to
people
can
provide
us
with
valuable
insight
from
various
perspectives
and
allow
us
to
make
more
informed
decisions
for
instance
research
has
suggested
that
taking
a
collaborative
approach
to
decision
making
can
help
to
create
greater
success
in
professional
settings
from
holding
team
meetings
to
encouraging
creative
dialogue
between
peers
seeking
various
ideas
and
opinions
can
prove
to
be
a
powerful
tool
in
helping
to
make
the
right
decision
among
the
most
famous
of
s
quotes
is
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
the
message
this
conveys
is
clear
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
one
s
life
it
is
important
to
stay
active
and
avoid
feelings
of
boredom
there
are
many
ways
to
stay
active
such
as
going
to
the
gym
those
who
attend
the
gym
regularly
enjoy
the
benefit
of
improved
health
increased
energy
and
better
cognitive
functioning
going
for
walks
is
another
way
to
get
moving
as
they
offer
an
opportunity
to
get
out
into
nature
and
get
the
blood
pumping
regular
walks
reduce
stress
and
increase
the
production
of
endorphins
giving
one
a
better
sense
of
wellbeing
finally
taking
on
a
job
is
a
great
way
to
fill
up
one
s
time
and
acquire
important
skills
getting
a
job
can
provide
important
skills
and
responsibilities
that
offer
a
sense
of
purpose
it
can
also
provide
money
to
pay
bills
as
well
as
the
means
to
enjoy
life
s
simple
pleasures
growing
up
my
family
would
constantly
encourage
me
to
reject
idleness
and
always
strive
to
be
productive
as
a
result
i
took
on
an
after school
job
and
loved
the
way
it
gave
me
purpose
and
allowed
me
to
still
have
time
for
my
hobbies
and
studies
i
also
started
playing
basketball
during
my
breaks
and
experienced
the
satisfaction
that
comes
from
dedicating
time
to
a
physical
activity
even
today
i
enjoy
going
for
long
walks
in
my
neighborhood
both
for
the
health
benefits
and
the
beauty
of
nature
graduating
early
from
high
school
can
provide
many
advantages
for
high
school
students
early
graduation
programs
allow
high
school
students
to
earn
their
high
school
diploma
in
less
time
and
free
up
space
in
their
schedule
for
more
rigorous
courses
allowing
students
to
get
into
college
more
quickly
additionally
summer
school
programs
such
as
or
courses
can
help
students
understand
their
courses
better
and
accelerate
their
high
school
graduation
timeline
however
there
are
some
potential
risks
associated
with
early
graduation
for
example
a
student
may
lack
the
knowledge
and
resources
needed
to
properly
prepare
for
college
and
could
find
themselves
lost
and
overwhelmed
in
college
courses
furthermore
a
student
who
graduates
early
may
encounter
difficulty
in
adapting
to
a
collegiate
atmosphere
where
social
status
is
more
important
than
academic
success
when
weighed
carefully
and
managed
correctly
graduating
early
can
help
a
student
have
a
better
future
an
early
graduate
can
enter
college
with
a
head
start
or
even
graduate
from
college
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
with
the
additional
free
time
after
graduation
students
may
pursue
their
interests
through
student
organizations
internships
or
jobs
or
prepare
for
graduate
school
by
graduating
early
a
student
can
give
themselves
an
opportunity
for
a
better
life
service
is
an
essential
way
to
keep
our
cities
clean
and
safe
not
only
does
it
promote
civic
responsibility
and
positive
values
in
our
society
but
it
also
directly
impacts
the
quality
of
life
in
our
cities
streets
provide
a
better
living
environment
for
our
citizens
reducing
garbage
and
potential
health
hazards
in
areas
where
there
is
a
lot
of
trash
and
debris
community
service
can
help
by
clearing
the
streets
of
rubbish
and
restoring
them
to
their
original
condition
by
working
together
citizens
can
do
their
part
to
ensure
that
their
city
looks
and
feels
better
additionally
community
service
can
also
play
a
role
in
keeping
our
cities
safe
projects
like
neighborhood
watch
programs
helping
to
repair
broken
streetlights
or
graffiti
removal
can
all
be
tackled
by
local
volunteers
the
increased
visibility
of
citizens
in
their
cities
sends
a
strong
signal
to
criminals
that
their
activities
will
not
go
unnoticed
by
working
together
to
keep
our
cities
safe
residents
can
get
a
sense
of
satisfaction
that
they
are
positively
contributing
to
their
communities
in
conclusion
community
service
is
a
key
method
to
help
keep
our
cities
clean
and
safe
it
allows
us
to
collectively
take
a
stand
against
littering
and
other
nuisances
that
can
detract
from
the
beauty
of
our
cities
at
the
same
time
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
citizens
to
come
together
and
make
a
positive
impact
on
the
safety
and
security
of
their
cities
after
careful
consideration
i
have
decided
that
a
career
in
medicine
is
the
best
fit
for
me
by
the
time
i
enter
high
school
i
have
already
begun
taking
a
number
of
courses
related
to
medicine
such
as
biology
chemistry
and
anatomy
and
i
have
also
been
researching
different
specialties
within
medicine
after
speaking
to
my
doctor
and
learning
more
about
the
different
sub fields
within
medicine
i
have
decided
that
i
would
like
to
pursue
a
career
in
neonatology
i
plan
to
increase
my
knowledge
of
this
field
by
taking
additional
courses
and
participating
in
internships
ultimately
i
am
determined
to
achieve
success
and
make
a
difference
in
this
field
high
school
is
an
important
milestone
in
a
young
person
s
life
and
it
is
generally
accepted
that
a
four year
program
is
the
appropriate
timeframe
for
most
students
to
achieve
the
necessary
skills
needed
for
college
and
to
prepare
for
adult
life
although
some
may
suggest
that
having
students
complete
their
high
school
education
in
three
years
instead
of
four
could
provide
cost
savings
and
reduce
the
number
of
dropouts
this
would
come
with
a
number
of
cons
to
begin
a
shorter
graduation
timeframe
could
lead
to
an
increased
number
of
unprepared
students
entering
college
without
a
full
four
years
of
high
school
students
would
miss
out
on
the
full
range
of
classes
and
experiences
that
are
part
of
a
standard
high
school
education
for
example
there
may
not
be
enough
time
to
take
the
full
sequence
of
math
classes
like
or
or
lab
science
classes
like
and
these
classes
are
essential
for
many
college
majors
and
without
them
students
would
not
be
adequately
prepared
to
take
on
the
coursework
for
college level
classes
additionally
reduced
opportunities
could
result
from
having
students
graduate
early
with
fewer
years
to
experience
high
school
students
may
not
have
enough
time
to
take
advantage
of
extracurricular
activities
and
clubs
such
as
student
government
or
volunteering
or
to
make
connections
with
teachers
and
classmates
that
could
be
used
as
references
for
college
or
job
applications
some
research
has
shown
that
coming
from
an
extended
high
school
experience
may
make
it
more
likely
for
students
to
successfully
finish
college
without
the
full
four
years
of
a
high
school
education
students
may
struggle
to
adjust
to
the
rigors
of
college
in
conclusion
although
there
may
be
initial
cost
savings
from
having
students
graduate
from
high
school
in
three
years
there
can
be
unintended
consequences
that
could
impede
the
success
of
students
both
in
college
and
in
their
later
careers
it
is
therefore
important
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
of
an
accelerated
high
school
experience
before
implementing
such
a
change
taking
your
own
path
and
self teaching
can
be
very
important
life
skills
as
they
can
lead
to
creative
problem
solving
and
a
more
independent
mindset
in
today
s
world
it
s
our
responsibility
to
adapt
and
grow
our
knowledge
on
our
own
as
the
world
keeps
changing
this
is
why
self teaching
is
more
important
than
ever
it
allows
us
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
take
things
into
our
own
hands
taking
your
own
path
can
lead
to
achieving
the
impossible
as
it
allows
you
to
think
unconventionally
and
explore
outside
the
box
for
example
famously
achieved
the
impossible
by
creating
the
lightbulb
something
that
was
thought
to
be
impossible
he
did
this
through
his
self teaching
willingness
to
explore
unknown
territory
and
refusal
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
challenge
knowing
where
you
want
to
go
in
life
and
taking
the
initiative
to
learn
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
is
necessary
to
achieve
your
goals
taking
your
own
path
encourages
self directed
learning
curiosity
and
development
of
transferable
skills
ultimately
taking
your
own
path
and
self teaching
are
key
life
skills
that
enable
us
to
think
beyond
what
we
already
know
and
take
matters
into
our
own
hands
my
first
experience
of
visiting
a
park
was
an
incredible
journey
through
a
variety
of
natural
and
man made
features
i
visited
a
in
the
city
i
lived
in
a
in
the
countryside
nearby
and
a
in
a
remote
region
when
i
stepped
into
the
i
was
overwhelmed
by
how
much
there
was
to
take
in
there
was
lush
grass
an
abundance
of
colourful
flowers
and
a
wide
range
of
trees
and
shrubs
around
the
area
the
park
was
also
filled
with
well maintained
walking
trails
playgrounds
for
children
and
even
a
few
ponds
for
wildlife
overall
i
was
in
awe
of
the
park
and
enjoyed
every
minute
of
my
exploration
the
i
visited
was
a
more
remote
location
yet
it
was
full
of
life
and
buzzing
with
activity
the
park
was
surrounded
by
thick
forests
tall
rolling
hills
and
sparkling
streams
i
was
surprised
by
how
huge
the
park
was
extending
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
were
wildlife
trails
wooden
bridges
and
plenty
of
picnic
spots
to
explore
i
was
in
awe
of
the
beauty
of
the
park
and
found
it
to
be
a
great
place
for
relaxing
my
last
stop
was
the
it
was
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
experienced
before
and
i
felt
like
i
had
stepped
into
a
dream
the
was
huge
and
it
was
filled
with
remarkable
sights
such
as
towering
waterfalls
snow peaked
mountains
and
crystal clear
lakes
it
was
a
refreshing
and
calming
experience
and
i
was
mesmerized
by
the
breathtaking
views
of
the
park
i
was
humbled
at
the
beauty
and
magnificence
of
the
parks
i
visited
every
experience
was
unique
and
special
in
its
own
way
and
all
of
them
have
left
me
with
a
deep
appreciation
for
nature
and
the
great
outdoors
taking
classes
from
home
has
become
more
popular
in
recent
years
due
to
many
benefits
for
starters
students
taking
online
classes
can
work
around
their
own
schedule
this
allows
for
flexibility
to
attend
classes
do
homework
and
participate
in
activities
without
having
to
leave
their
home
another
benefit
is
the
cost
savings
associated
with
online
courses
since
students
don
t
have
to
pay
for
transportation
or
for
food
at
cafeterias
they
can
save
money
on
the
overall
cost
of
the
class
parents
can
also
be
more
trusting
of
their
children
taking
classes
from
home
since
they
don
t
have
to
leave
their
house
and
their
attendance
is
monitored
many
online
courses
allow
students
to
interact
and
discuss
topics
with
their
peers
via
video
chat
or
instant
messaging
services
and
this
can
lead
to
a
more
engaged
learning
experience
furthermore
not
having
an
in person
instructor
means
that
students
can
t
be
absent
from
class
which
has
a
positive
effect
on
their
overall
course
grades
finally
if
any
issue
does
arise
with
an
online
class
more
often
than
not
there
is
a
helpdesk
or
online
resource
available
to
provide
support
and
answers
to
any
questions
as
long
as
students
are
following
course
instructions
taking
classes
from
home
can
be
a
great
way
for
them
to
learn
without
having
to
leave
the
house
my
life
has
always
been
dictated
by
my
dreams
and
ambitions
ever
since
i
was
young
i
was
encouraged
to
imagine
and
follow
through
on
my
goals
no
matter
how
difficult
or
improbable
they
seemed
obstacle
i
faced
was
an
opportunity
to
show
resilience
and
learn
from
any
mistakes
i
have
always
been
driven
by
the
belief
that
if
i
work
hard
then
i
can
achieve
whatever
i
set
my
mind
to
my
biggest
motivation
has
been
my
family
they
have
taught
me
that
no
matter
what
obstacles
i
may
face
i
can
always
pick
myself
up
and
keep
going
the
unfaltering
support
and
unconditional
love
they
have
shown
me
have
been
fundamental
in
my
journey
to
realize
my
dreams
i
have
made
numerous
sacrifices
to
work
towards
my
goals
i
have
persevered
through
the
times
of
struggle
and
silence
the
voices
of
doubt
that
try
to
get
in
the
way
i
have
chosen
to
take
risks
challenging
convention
and
pushing
the
boundaries
for
myself
i
have
refused
to
give
up
despite
any
opposition
and
i
see
this
as
a
personal
strength
that
i
will
carry
with
me
on
my
path
to
greatness
the
importance
of
persevering
and
not
giving
up
on
my
dreams
is
something
i
value
deeply
it
is
something
that
i
strive
to
remind
myself
of
every
day
regardless
of
the
situation
life
can
be
hard
and
there
will
always
be
setbacks
but
if
i
maintain
my
focus
and
continue
to
stay
on
course
i
know
i
can
fulfill
my
goals
and
achieve
success
phones
have
become
an
integral
part
of
our
daily
lives
with
an
ever increasing
penetration
in
our
schools
on
one
hand
cell
phones
offer
conveniences
such
as
access
to
online
resources
and
can
be
used
for
educational
tools
such
as
apps
as
well
as
an
outlet
for
reporting
instances
of
bullying
or
abuse
on
the
other
hand
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
school
can
be
distracting
to
students
and
their
misuse
can
result
in
cheating
on
exams
and
cyberbullying
the
debate
on
allowing
cell
phones
in
school
should
consider
the
respective
pros
and
cons
as
well
as
the
potential
solutions
to
effectively
manage
the
devices
use
in
an
educational
setting
cell
phones
completely
might
be
too
extreme
if
the
main
concern
is
misuse
as
confiscating
them
away
from
students
would
not
hold
oneself
accountable
to
foster
responsible
behaviors
an
alternate
approach
could
be
to
allow
the
use
of
cell
phones
under
teacher
supervision
emphasizing
the
importance
of
appropriate
usage
in
the
classroom
as
a
digital
literacy
skill
and
through
the
use
of
classroom
policies
the
prevalence
of
cell
phones
in
school
also
gives
rise
to
the
use
of
alternative
solutions
such
as
filtering
applications
and
messaging
services
that
limit
distractions
and
inappropriate
media
access
these
solutions
are
a
way
to
create
a
balance
between
the
potential
misuse
of
cell
phones
in
school
and
their
potential
benefits
as
learning
tools
it
is
also
important
to
consider
making
resources
available
for
students
to
learn
proper
internet
safety
and
for
teachers
to
understand
and
accommodate
the
devices
use
in
the
classroom
overall
we
can
not
deny
the
advantages
of
cell
phone
use
in
school
but
we
should
also
recognize
the
potential
risks
if
left
unmanaged
by
studying
how
to
effectively
manage
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
an
educational
setting
and
by
implementing
appropriate
policies
we
can
ensure
a
safe
and
responsible
learning
environment
for
our
students
parents
of
teenagers
often
have
to
juggle
conflicting
priorities
on
one
side
they
want
their
children
to
experience
the
freedoms
that
come
with
growing
up
on
the
other
they
need
to
ensure
their
children
are
making
good
choices
and
staying
safe
a
curfew
could
provide
a
balance
by
establishing
reasonable
expectations
for
when
teenagers
should
be
returning
home
adopting
a
weekday
curfew
and
a
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
would
help
lead
to
improved
responsibility
and
decreased
risk
of
late night
trouble
with
a
curfew
teenagers
would
be
less
likely
to
be
involved
in
risky
activities
such
as
drinking
drug
use
or
criminal
behavior
this
could
easily
be
prevented
by
having
a
structured
time
for
when
they
should
be
returning
home
teens
would
be
better
able
to
plan
which
activities
they
could
attend
and
which
would
have
to
be
skipped
this
teaches
them
how
to
be
responsible
and
make
choices
within
the
given
time
and
boundary
constraints
receiving
adequate
rest
is
also
a
key
part
of
good
decision making
adolescents
need
hours
of
sleep
a
night
but
many
experience
sleep
deprivation
due
to
poor
sleep
hygiene
or
staying
up
late
on
school
nights
a
curfew
could
help
improve
sleep
and
focus
during
the
day
due
to
a
healthier
amount
of
rest
in
addition
the
adoption
of
a
curfew
could
encourage
families
to
spend
more
time
together
by
having
their
teenagers
home
by
an
early
evening
parents
would
have
the
opportunity
to
have
more
meals
together
engage
in
conversations
and
play
games
establishing
a
regular
curfew
could
help
foster
a
stronger
family
bond
during
these
critical
teenage
years
in
conclusion
implementing
a
weekday
and
a
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
is
beneficial
for
the
overall
physical
and
mental
health
of
teenagers
as
well
as
in
improving
their
responsibility
decreasing
their
risk
of
late night
trouble
and
increasing
family
time
when
faced
with
a
problem
it
s
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
or
to
give
up
too
quickly
however
this
quote
can
serve
as
a
reminder
that
every
problem
is
a
chance
for
you
to
do
your
best
to
become
a
better
version
of
yourself
for
example
in
school
you
could
use
a
difficult
homework
set
to
push
yourself
to
learn
the
material
more
thoroughly
rather
than
simply
trying
to
get
by
or
giving
up
in
sports
a
difficult
scrimmage
could
be
the
perfect
opportunity
to
practice
a
difficult
skill
or
to
work
on
endurance
and
in
personal
life
a
challenging
situation
such
as
a
conflict
with
a
friend
can
be
an
opportunity
to
practice
effective
communication
or
to
learn
more
about
how
to
peacefully
resolve
conflicts
the
quote
also
encourages
us
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
for
instance
if
you
fail
a
test
you
can
reflect
on
what
you
could
have
done
differently
and
strive
to
make
improvements
next
time
similarly
in
relationships
mistakes
are
inevitable but
rather
than
avoiding
them
use
mistakes
as
a
chance
to
grow
and
learn
how
to
be
a
better
friend
i
agree
with
this
quote
as
it
encourages
a
growth
mindset
and
emphasizes
the
importance
of
learning
from
mistakes
it
reminds
us
that
we
have
the
potential
to
become
better
and
that
mistakes
are
not
the
end
of
our
journey
choosing
to
follow
someone
else
s
agreement
when
it
comes
to
self growth
and
development
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
consequences
for
example
if
a
person
chooses
to
take
a
mentor
s
advice
and
apply
their
advice
to
their
decision making
process
it
can
lead
to
faster
personal
growth
and
achievement
of
long term
goals
on
the
other
hand
following
someone
else
s
agreement
can
also
have
detrimental
effects
such
as
blindly
accepting
advice
without
careful
consideration
and
analysis
this
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
personal
growth
as
the
individual
is
not
challenging
themselves
or
learning
new
skills
to
ensure
the
most
positive
outcome
when
following
someone
else
s
agreement
it
is
important
to
be
discerning
and
think
through
decisions
from
multiple
perspectives
the
renowned
essayist
and
poet
perhaps
best
summed
up
the
importance
of
pushing
ourselves
beyond
our
boundaries
with
his
quote
unless
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
done
this
sentiment
resonates
deeply
with
many
of
us
as
it
draws
attention
to
our
potential
for
growth
there
are
three
key
reasons
why
this
quote
is
so
valid
and
inspiring
firstly
as
we
try
something
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
it
allows
us
to
discover
new
skills
knowledge
and
passions
for
example
if
someone
has
traditionally
worked
in
finance
they
might
find
that
they
enjoy
and
have
an
aptitude
for
sales
or
marketing
secondly
by
expanding
our
repertoire
of
abilities
it
opens
up
more
opportunities
for
advancement
or
career
changes
meaning
our
future
prospects
are
increased
for
instance
if
someone
has
a
passion
for
counselling
they
may
find
that
their
experience
in
business
could
help
them
to
secure
the
role
lastly
pushing
ourselves
enables
us
to
build
our
self reliance
and
self belief
taking
on
a
challenge
or
exploring
a
new
area
can
help
us
to
trust
in
our
abilities
and
be
more
confident
in
difficult
situations
trying
something
beyond
what
we
have
already
done
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
our
lives
not
only
can
our
careers
be
boosted
but
we
also
gain
a
greater
understanding
of
our
capabilities
and
resources
going
beyond
our
limits
instils
courage
and
resolve
in
us
and
helps
us
to
move
forward
into
our
future
with
more
purpose
and
resilience
s
famous
quote
speaks
to
the
impact
that
our
behavior
can
have
on
the
attitudes
of
those
around
us
drawing
on
his
own
experience
as
a
philosopher
theologian
and
medical
doctor
believed
that
example
was
the
single
most
important
factor
in
influencing
the
attitudes
of
others
for
him
it
was
essential
to
lead
by
example
to
act
upon
what
we
preach
and
to
demonstrate
the
values
we
profess
only
then
argued
can
we
truly
have
an
impact
on
the
beliefs
and
convictions
of
others
this
is
why
s
quote
is
particularly
relevant
to
this
subject
as
it
offers
a
poignant
reminder
of
how
powerful
examples
can
be
in
setting
the
standard
for
how
others
act
and
think
being
true
to
oneself
is
incredibly
important
in
life
because
it
establishes
a
sense
of
inner
security
and
acceptance
by
staying
true
to
oneself
a
person
s
real
identity
and
purpose
can
be
realized
and
life
can
become
much
more
fulfilling
when
a
person
is
not
influenced
by
what
others
say
they
are
free
to
make
decisions
based
on
their
own
needs
beliefs
and
values
which
can
lead
to
a
greater
sense
of
happiness
and
fulfillment
being
true
to
oneself
can
also
be
beneficial
to
others
if
everyone
embraced
their
true
self
there
would
be
less
pressure
to
conform
to
certain
ideals
which
could
foster
greater
self confidence
and
courage
among
individual
being
true
to
oneself
is
also
a
sign
of
self respect
which
can
be
an
admirable
quality
that
encourages
others
to
appreciate
their
own
unique
qualities
losing
weight
has
been
a
goal
of
mine
for
some
time
however
it
is
important
for
me
to
identify
the
main
reasons
so
i
can
stay
focused
on
my
goal
the
three
main
reasons
for
wanting
to
lose
weight
are
to
improve
physical
health
increase
self confidence
and
reduce
the
risk
of
health
complications
to
improve
physical
health
weight
loss
can
help
to
reduce
the
risk
of
long term
health
complications
such
as
obesity
heart
disease
and
type
diabetes
by
maintaining
a
healthy
weight
i
can
reduce
the
strain
on
my
body
increasing
my
energy
levels
decreasing
risk
of
injury
and
improving
my
overall
physical
fitness
i
want
to
increase
my
self confidence
by
losing
weight
tracking
my
progress
and
seeing
the
results
of
my
hard
work
will
give
me
an
immense
sense
of
accomplishment
and
motivation
to
further
improve
knowing
i
am
taking
steps
to
improve
my
body
and
health
is
likely
to
improve
my
outlook
on
life
and
make
me
feel
more
positive
about
myself
finally
i
hope
to
reduce
the
risk
of
health
complications
caused
by
my
current
weight
being
overweight
or
obese
can
increase
the
risk
of
a
variety
of
health
conditions
reducing
my
weight
will
decrease
the
strain
on
my
body
helping
to
protect
me
from
certain
health
complications
in
the
future
overall
achieving
my
goal
of
losing
weight
would
help
me
to
improve
my
physical
health
increase
self confidence
and
reduce
the
risk
of
health
complications
additionally
achieving
this
goal
would
help
inspire
others
and
support
them
on
their
own
journey
of
achieving
positive
change
choosing
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
a
difficult
and
impactful
decision
making
a
commitment
to
a
particular
profession
can
open
exciting
doors
and
opportunities
but
it
can
also
lead
to
feelings
of
obligation
and
higher
stress
levels
it
s
important
to
consider
the
practicalities
of
the
job
such
as
the
level
of
education
required
and
potential
earnings
for
high
school
students
looking
to
start
down
a
career
path
course
selection
should
be
based
on
what
will
ultimately
lead
to
success
in
a
chosen
field
of
course
students
need
to
explore
all
of
their
options
and
understand
the
pros
and
cons
of
committing
to
a
particular
career
it
s
also
worth
taking
into
account
the
potential
emotional
and
financial
effects
of
such
a
commitment
on
both
the
student
and
their
family
it
s
important
to
maintain
a
sense
of
independence
and
autonomy
while
still
making
sound
decisions
for
the
future
throughout
history
many
great
thinkers
have
offered
the
advice
to
aim
high
is
one
of
the
most
renowned
artists
of
all
time
and
he
had
a
particularly
notable
opinion
on
setting
goals
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
acknowledged
that
not
successfully
achieving
a
goal
can
be
disheartening
but
it
does
not
compare
to
achieving
a
low
goal
and
being
underwhelmed
with
the
results
in
order
to
reach
a
high
goal
there
must
be
confidence
to
tackle
the
challenge
this
is
especially
true
when
it
involves
activities
or
professions
that
come
with
more
risk
of
failure
such
as
the
arts
or
science
innovators
challenges
arise
when
an
obstacle
is
encountered
and
confidence
will
help
foster
the
perseverance
needed
to
overcome
the
challenge
moreover
the
emotions
of
pride
and
accomplishment
will
ultimately
be
the
reward
for
all
the
hard
work
and
dedication
that
goes
into
achieving
a
challenging
goal
the
positive
effects
of
setting
high
goals
can
not
be
overlooked
even
if
those
goals
are
not
achieved
the
discipline
and
focus
needed
to
commit
to
challenging
goals
can
introduce
a
sense
of
purpose
and
provide
valuable
lessons
that
can
be
reapplied
in
similar
situations
many
great
people
have
failed
multiple
times
before
succeeding
therefore
taking
the
risk
and
recognizing
the
potential
of
what
can
be
accomplished
will
make
a
greater
impact
than
the
fear
associated
with
failure
overall
s
statement
encourages
us
to
challenge
ourselves
by
setting
high
expectations
despite
the
risk
of
failure
the
rewards
that
come
with
successfully
achieving
a
goal
far
exceed
any
disappointment
from
falling
short
the
confidence
challenge
and

reflection
on
failure
i
have
faced
failure
many
times
in
my
life
but
there
is
one
experience
that
stands
out
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
applied
to
a
soccer
academy
with
the
hope
of
playing
against
some
of
the
best
players
in
my
region
unfortunately
i
did
not
make
the
team
i
was
devastated
and
considered
giving
up
on
the
sport
but
i
realized
that
i
still
had
something
to
prove
and
my
determination
to
work
hard
and
succeed
kept
me
going
i
spent
the
whole
summer
practicing
every
day
and
by
the
end
of
the
season
i
became
one
of
the
top
players
in
my
city
this
experience
taught
me
that
success
comes
from
perseverance
and
hard
work
said
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
and
i
believe
this
statement
is
true
is
a
tough
pill
to
swallow
but
if
you
take
the
time
to
reflect
on
it
and
work
hard
to
reach
your
goals
success
can
be
right
around
the
corner

eating

interaction
many
people
have
decreased

their
family

friends
outside

feelings

isolation
and
disconnection
on
the
flip
side

people
in
different
locations
helping

build
closer
ties
with
people
who

otherwise
be
hard

to
be
picked
up

a
student

a
school
project
and

can
gain
a
boost
in
their
self esteem
that
student
may
then
set
larger
goals
for
themselves
in
the
future
and
feel
more

of
meeting
challenges
alternatively
a
worker
who
receives
a

can
feel
proud
of
their
success

recognition
of
their
achievement
can
boost
their

self esteem
for

a

for
life
and
can
lead
to
unhappiness
unrestrained
stress
and
difficulty
in
achieving
goals

is
easy
to
allow
negative
thoughts
to
take
control
and
to
become
consumed
by
them

a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
remain
conscious
and
aware
standing
strong
even
through
life
s
hardest
struggles

qualities
as

to
lead
a
constructive
life

on
solutions
not
problems
and

us
the
strength
to
stay
resilient

a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
living
a
successful
life
positive
thinking
can

us
resolve
any
situation
in
a
flexible
and
composed
manner
allowing

service
is
an
invaluable
tool
used
to
enhance
the
wellbeing
of
our
communities
and
our
planet
by
engaging
in
activities
such
as
volunteering
helping
others
and
cleaning
up
our
environment
we
can
work
collectively
to
make
a
positive
impact
in
our
world
despite
this
there
are
still
people
who
think
community
service
is
just
a
waste
of
time
these
people
likely
disregard
the
importance
of
taking
responsibility
for
our
waste
and
disposing
of
it
properly
not
only
is
this
irresponsible
but
it
can
also
have
negative
consequences
on
our
communities
and
environment
by
ensuring
that
we
dispose
of
our
waste
in
the
proper
ways
we
can
make
sure
to
protect
our
environment
and
avoid
additional
issues
fortunately
there
are
many
ways
that
we
can
make
our
community
and
world
a
better
place
we
can
volunteer
our
time
and
energy
to
help
those
in
need
participate
in
events
to
help
clean
up
our
environment
and
take
an
active
role
in
our
local
governments
to
promote
policies
that

the
well being
of
our
societies
in
conclusion
community
service
is
a
necessary
commitment
to
make
our

a
responsibility
to
take
care
of
our

those
in
need
and
find
ways
to
work
together
for
the

is
the

is
essential
in
everyday
life
it
s
the
foundation
of
any
healthy
relationship
be
that
with
your
family
friends
or
colleagues
is
an
important
factor
in
gaining
trust
from
others
as
it
shows
that
you
are
trustworthy
and
reliable
trying
to
cover
up
lies
can
be
damaging
to
relationships
as
it
erodes
trust
and
can
cause
considerable
distress
many
situations
demonstrate
when
honesty
is
the
best
policy
for
example
if
you
make
a
mistake
at
work
it
s
best
to
own
up
to
it
instead
of
trying
to
pass
the
blame
honest
about
your
shortcomings
demonstrates
integrity
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
it
also
shows
that
you
are
accountable
for
your
actions
and
is
far
more
likely
to
be
viewed
positively
by
colleagues
than
trying
to
save
face
of
course
there
can
be
serious
consequences
of
lying
breaching
somebody
s
trust
can
hurt
them
and
can
take
a
long
time
to
repair
after
an
act
of
dishonesty
if
you
are
caught
lying
even
once
it
will
be
incredibly
difficult
to
regain
someone
s
faith
in
you
and
the
truth
going
forward
ultimately
honesty
is
the
best
path
to
ensure
relationships
are
built
on
trust
working
in
the
food
industry
has
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
it
is
important
to
weigh
them
against
each
other
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
one
important
benefit
of
working
in
the
food
industry
is
that
it
can
provide
a
stable
income
and
the
potential
for
a
rewarding
career
on
the
other
hand
working
in
food
service
often
requires
long
hours
and
can
be
physically
and
emotionally
demanding
working
in
the
food
industry
can
have
an
impact
on
one
s
academic
performance
and
relationship
with
family
and
friends
so
it
is
important
to
consider
these
social
implications
there
are
a
variety
of
roles
in
the
food
industry
ranging
from
chef
and
restaurant
owner
to
food
delivery
driver
and
food
preparer
knowing
what
kind
of
work
is
available
in
the
food
industry
is
essential
in
selecting
the
perfect
job
taking
the
time
to
visit
and
observe
a
professional
kitchen
can
help
familiarize
oneself
with
the
atmosphere
and
potentially
provide
valuable
insight
into
the
career
finally
it
is
important
to
find
a
job
that
one
enjoys
since
it
can
make
the
work
more
enjoyable
and
rewarding
failure
is
an
undeniably
vital
part
of
success
as
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
that
failure
can
lead
to
success
and
not
believing
in
giving
up
is
an
essential
factor
in
achieving
our
goals
agreeing
with
s
attitude
resilience
is
required
when
pursuing
a
task
when
things
don
t
go
as
planned
it
can
be
disheartening
but
it
s
important
to
keep
pushing
through
and
keep
working
towards
the
desired
outcome
often
the
path
to
success
is
full
of
obstacles
and
failure
one
must
be
willing
to
view
these
challenges
as
bumps
in
the
road
and
opportunities
to
become
better
and
strive
towards
bigger
goals
encouraging
oneself
to
keep
going
even
after
making
mistakes
and
discouraging
situations
is
a
trait
that
can
be
learned
and
dedication
can
help
propel
even
the
hardest
tasks
and
being
open minded
and
understanding
that
it
takes
timing
and
dedication
is
important
for
success
the
importance
of
s
rhetoric
is
highlighted
in
numerous
success
stories
whether
it
s
entrepreneurs
athletes
or
artists
many
of
the
most
successful
people
have
endured
failure
and
persisted
until
they
have
achieved
their
goals
in
essence
showing
agreement
with
s
idea
of
failure
as
a
stepping
stone
is
integral
in
pushing
boundaries
and
achieving
success
to
create
a
character
of
your
own
design
the
first
step
is
to
determine
the
role
that
you
want
this
character
to
have
do
you
want
them
to
be
a
hero
or
a
villain
a
bystander
or
a
leader
once
you
have
established
their
role
you
can
then
begin
to
define
the
character
s
motivations
and
personality
traits
it
is
important
to
become
confident
in
the
decisions
that
you
make
and
try
to
plan
for
future
decisions
when
it
comes
to
your
character
furthermore
you
should
also
think
of
ways
to
reach
the
goals
that
you
set
for
your
character
what
steps
do
you
need
to
take
in
order
to
get
there
consider
how
your
character
s
choices
will
be
perceived
by
others
and
how
this
could
affect
the
success
of
reaching
their
goals
doing
research
into
the
challenges
they
may
face
and
how
to
become
the
person
you
envisioned
can
help
you
create
a
realistic
character
with
achievable
goals
after
carefully
considering
all
these
aspects
you
can
begin
to
draft
your
vision
for
the
character
is
a
powerful
indicator
of
success
many
successful
people
adopt
a
positive
attitude
to
maximize
their
opportunities
and
reach
their
goals
for
example
a
renowned
author
and
teacher
believes
that
the
most
crucial
ingredient
for
success
is
a
positive
attitude
she
asserts
that
attaining
a
successful
life
is
more
about
attitude
than
aptitude
and
encourages
people
to
live
every
moment
with
positivity
and
gratitude
other
successful
people
such
as
star
have
proven
that
a
positive
attitude
is
necessary
for
true
success
as
a
player
for
the
refused
to
give
in
to
adversity
and
continually
sought
to
remain
positive
in
order
to
lead
the
team
to
victory
among
the
greatest
talents
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
great
successes
a
positive
attitude
can
help
individuals
become
successful
by
teaching
them
to
focus
on
their
goals
leading
them
to
find
creative
solutions
to
problems
and
helping
them
stay
motivated
it
is
important
to
remember
that
success
is
not
a
destination
but
a
journey
with
the
right
attitude
success
can
be
achieved
despite
the
obstacles
therefore
attitude
should
always
be
considered
an
essential
part
of
the
success
equation
and
people
should
strive
to
remain
positive
in
all
situations
is
something
that
many
people
strive
for
but
few
actually
achieve
it
this
is
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
success
requires
hard
work
and
dedication
qualities
that
not
everyone
possesses
however
two
key
factors

get
better
with
each
attempt

a
sense
of
humility
is
just
as
important
in
the
pursuit
of
success
it
is
a
trait
that
keeps
us
grounded
and
realistic
it
reminds
us
not
to
get
too
caught
up
in
our
successes
or
failures
and
to
remember
that
no
one
ultimately
knows
what
the
future
holds
a
humble
frame
of
mind
also
encourages
us
to
always
be
open
to
learning
new
things
and
to
stay
determined
no
matter
how
long
the
road
ahead

of
a
person

and
humility
was

works
she
worked
tirelessly

and
dedicated
in
everything
she
did

the
bedrock
of
resilience
that
allows

to
endure
any
kind
of
failure
but
they
also
allow
us
to
remain
focused
and
motivated
on
our
goals
no
matter
the
challenges
with
the
right
attitude
and
an
open
heart
anyone
can
open
the
doors
leading
to
personal
success
distance
learning
can
be
an
incredibly
beneficial
tool
for
students
in
a
variety
of
situations
it
offers
the
unprecedented
convenience
of
being
able
to
access
classes
and
complete
coursework
from
the
comfort
of
your

home
providing
the
autonomy
to
structure
learning
around
existing
commitments
and
lifestyle
for
those
with
busier
schedules
distance
learning
can
be
a
great
way
to
work
through
schooling
without
sacrificing
work
or
other
commitments
similarly
distance
learning
can
provide
comfort
and
flexibility
for
those
who
want
to
learn
independently
or
take
their
time
to
reflect
on
the
material
at
hand
that
being
said
distance
learning
is
not
without
its
drawbacks
for
some
the
lack
of
motivation
or
focus
can
be
a
significant
hindrance
to
learning
additionally
the
distance
between
student
and
teacher
can
impede
the
quality
of
the
class
providing
less
of
an
interactive
learning
experience
than
being
physically
present
ultimately
distance
learning
is
best
suited
for
students
who
value
autonomy
organization
and
independent
thinking
those
who
want
to
stay
on
top
of
their
coursework
without
having
to
attend
physical
classes
are
ideal
candidates
it
s
important
to
be
honest
about
the
inherent
limitations
of
distance
learning
however
and
to
recognize
what
type
of
learner
will
be
the
best
suited
for
this
type
of
environment
attending
school
is
the
traditional
way
for
students
to
further
their
education
but
with
advancements
in
technology
distance
learning
and
school
at
home
programs
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
these
programs
allow
students
to
keep
up
with
their
studies
without
leaving
the
comfort
of
their
homes
but
there
are
several
pros
and
cons
to
consider
regarding
each
option
one
of
the
main
benefits
to
traditional
school
is
the
development
of
social
skills
students
gain
valuable
life
experiences
from
meeting
and
interacting
with
other
classmates
they
also
learn
to
work
together
to
complete
group
projects
develop
communication
skills
and
gain
essential
life
lessons
at
home
these
opportunities
do
not
always
present
themselves
as
easily
and
a
student
s
overall
development
of
skills
may
be
affected
the
traditional
school
system
also
prepares
students
for
their
adult
lives
offer
resources
such
as
guidance
counselors
college
prep
classes
and
résumé
and
job
skills
workshops
students
gain
technical
information
from
lectures
and
textbooks
but
the
one on one
interaction
and
collaboration
are
what
truly
prepares
them
for
the
real
world
for
students
that
are
motivated
organized
and
independent
learners
school
at
home
or
distance
learning
programs
are
a
great
option
but
it
is
not
the
right
fit
for
everyone
traditional
school
provides
the
social
interaction
resources
and
individualizing
instruction
that
is
essential
for
helping
children
grow
into
successful
confident
adults
it
is
for
this
reason
that
traditional
school
remains
a
better
option
than
school
at
home
or
distance
learning
for
students
distance
learning
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
recent
years
allowing
students
to
learn
in
a
convenient
and
flexible
way
the
advantages
of
distance
learning
for
students
are
numerous
ranging
from
increased
transportation
convenience
to
the
freedom
to
choose
between
activities
when
it
comes
to
transportation
distance
learning
removes
the
need
for
students
to
travel
to
a
physical
class
location
this
can
save
students
money
and
time
as
they
no
longer
have
to
allocate
resources
on
either
commuting
or
spending
hours
sitting
in
a
classroom
additionally
students
are
free
to
take
classes
from
anywhere
in
the
world
allowing
for
great
flexibility
regarding
learning
environments
learning
also
helps
students
streamline
their
study
time
as
they
don
t
have
to
factor
in
breaks
for
food
students
can
continue
working
for
extended
periods
without
the
distraction
of
meals
or
worries
about
getting
hungry
this
makes
learning
more
efficient
as
students
can
focus
for
longer
amounts
of
time
without
the
interruption
of
regular
meal
times
in
addition
students
are
given
more
autonomy
when
it
comes
to
choosing
activities
outside
of
studies
without
the
restriction
of
a
literal
school
time
bell
telling
them
when
to
start
and
stop
studying
students
can
adjust
their
work
schedules
to
suit
their
everyday
lives
whether
it
be
part
time
jobs
sports
or
other
hobbies
distance
learning
allows
students
to
make
the
most
of
their
free
time
in
conclusion
distance
learning
provides
countless
benefits
for
students
in
terms
of
transportation
food
and
flexible
activities
it
allows
for
a
more
convenient
and
personalized
learning
experience
allowing
students
to
tailor
their
studies
to
their
own
needs
first
impressions
can
be
formed
many
ways
whether
through
physical
and
emotional
events
such
as
the
way
a
person
looks
and
acts
or
through
various
environmental
factors
such
as
the
people
places
monuments
and
conversations
a
person
is
exposed
to
it
is
possible
for
the
past
experiences
or
environment
to
affect
first
impressions
for
example
if
someone
has
experienced
a
series
of
negative
events
they
may
be
more
likely
to
have
a
negative
outlook
on
life
and
be
less
likely
to
have
a
positive
initial
impression
the
conversation
between
two
people
is
a
big
factor
in
the
formation
of
first
impressions
plays
a
significant
role
here
as
people
who
are
able
to
empathize
and
understand
one
another
s
point
of
view
tend
to
form
more
positive
impressions
conversely
communication
that
lacks
agreement
can
lead
to
negative
impressions
although
the
past
and
environment
can
impact
first
impressions
it
is
possible
to
change
them
specific
examples
of
how
this
can
be
achieved
include
gaining
new
experiences
being
more
open minded
and
tolerant
to
new
ideas
and
forming
positive
relationships
it
is
worth
noting
however
that
first
impressions
are
not
always
accurate
and
getting
to
know
a
person
better
can
often
lead
to
more
positive
and
lasting
impressions
in
conclusion
first
impressions
can
be
impacted
by
a
person
s
past
or
environment
the
way
two
people
communicate
to
one
another
as
well
as
the
places
and
people
a
person
comes
in
contact
with
can
affect
initial
impressions
however
one
is
never
truly
stuck
with
their
first
impression
as
it
is
possible
to
change
them
by
having
new
experiences
being
open minded
and
forming
positive
relationships
life
can
be
a
roller
coaster
with
moments
of
joy
and
despair
it
can
be
easy
to
give
up
when
obstacles
present
themselves
but
it
s
important
to
remember
that
things
can
always
look
up
can
help
someone
during
tough
times
and
provide
tools
for
managing
difficult
situations
can
be
gained
from
personal
experiences
and
lessons
and
is
especially
helpful
when
it
comes
to
understanding
and
problem
solving
i
have
personally
seen
the
power
of
wisdom
in
my
life
growing
up
i
was
often
faced
with
difficult
experiences
and
conflicts
that
seemed
insurmountable
with
the
help
of
wisdom
i
was
able
to
emerge
from
these
hardships
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
world
and
how
to
handle
tough
situations
i
learned
to
take
a
step
back
and
view
the
situation
as
an
observer
allowing
me
to
more
clearly
see
the
solutions
and
paths
around
the
problem
this
wisdom
has
helped
me
to
continue
striving
forward
even
when
the
odds
seem
stacked
against
me
an
encouraging
word
or
gesture
can
make
all
the
difference
to
someone
who
is
having
a
bad
day
i
believe
it
is
important
to
share
wisdom
when
it
is
needed
the
most
offering
advice
or
a
listening
ear
to
those
who
are
suffering
can
be
immensely
helpful
everyone
has
their
own
journey
and
i
believe
it
is
important
to
be
there
to
provide
comfort
and
understanding
when
it
is
needed
sharing
wisdom
can
be
a
great
act
of
compassion
and
understanding
helping
others
to
learn
and
grow
from
difficult
experiences
the
creation
of
a
homework
club
has
been
proven
to
provide
students
with
additional
support
in
their
educational
pursuits
has
demonstrated
that
students
benefit
from
having
access
to
a
safe
and
structured
environment
in
which
to
complete
their
school
assignments
when
determining
the
best
time
to
host
the
homework
club
it
is
important
to
consider
the
students
academic
schedules
to
ensure
they
have
ample
time
to
finish
their
homework
to
successfully
host
a
homework
club
foundational
materials
such
as
books

access
to
the
internet
supplies
and
other
resources
should
be
made
available
to
promote
the
homework
club
to
students

flyers
distributing
announcements
and
holding
short
meetings
before
or

collect
data
on
student
grades

are
becoming
more
popular
for

there
are
some
risks
to
consider
the
lack
of

can
make
it
difficult
to
gauge
a
student
s
understanding
of
the
material
as
well
as
limit
the
effectiveness
of
corrective
learning
methods
additionally
there
is
the
potential
for
the
student
to
be
distracted
by
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
access
the
course
from
anywhere
for
college
students
there
is

provide
an

the
potential
for

be
overwhelmed
when
taking
multiple
classes
online
as
it
can
be
more
difficult
to
create
a
balance
between
work
assignments
and

offer
it
is
important
to

the
pros

support
during

and
in
science
technology
has
drastically
changed
how
people
live
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
has
a
plethora
of
benefits
it
s
often
said
that
a
positive
outlook
on
life
is
half
the
battle
and
it
can
be
incredibly
important
for
success
with
a
positive
attitude
job
opportunities
can
be
more
easily
obtained
employers
often
prefer
those
with
a
strong
positive
disposition
and
a
negative
attitude
can
be
detrimental
when
interviewing
for
a
job
in
addition
a
positive
attitude
can
be
immensely
helpful
when
making
decisions
being
confident
in
one
s
decisions
and
having
a
clear
perspective
can
be
important
when
working
towards
a
desired
goal
a
positive
attitude
can
also
be
beneficial
when
facing
difficult
life
situations
it
can
give
strength
to
endure
through
hardships
and
peace
of
mind
to
not
be
overcome
by
stress
and
anxiety
while
some
may
argue
that
one
s
and
hard
work
is
more
than
enough
for
success
it
shouldn
t
be
overlooked
that
often
a
positive
attitude
is
necessary
for
success
in
many
cases
hard
work
and
a
sound
attitude
can
be
beneficial
together
the
two
can
come
together
to
create
an
effective
strategy
where
both
can
complement
each
other
and
contribute
greatly
to
an
individual
s
success
therefore
it
may
be
argued
that
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
just
as
important
as
one
s
intelligence
and
hard
work

technology
has
had
a
profound
impact
on
people
s
lives
over
the
past
several
decades
with
increasingly
positive
effects
being
felt
in
economic
educational
and
familial
aspects
of
life
in
economic
terms
technology
has
been
the
backbone
of
much
of
the
dramatic
capacity
for
wealth
generation
seen
in
many
countries
over
the
past
decades
has
played
a
key
role
in
allowing
for
the
growth
of
global
markets
and
increased
mobility
of
goods
and
services
through
the
world
allowing
many
countries
to
experience
unprecedented
economic
growth
technology
has
also
had
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
educational
sector
technologies
have
increased
the
capacity
to
access
and
disseminate
information
incredibly
quickly
allowing
educational
institutes
to
expand
their
reach
further
than
ever
before
additionally
advances
in
computer assisted
education
have
allowed
for
more
efficient
and
effective
teaching
and
learning
with
digital
textbooks
and
interactive
lessons
playing
a
major
part
in
modern
classrooms
finally
technology
has
deeply
impacted
the
way
we
interact
with
family
and
loved
ones
the
proliferation
of
social
networking
services
video
communication
and
chat
apps
have
cultivated
a
world
of
gadget enabled
communication
often
allowing
family
members
to
stay
in
touch
who
would
otherwise
be
distant
this
has
made
it
easier
to
bridge
gaps
of
geographic
distance
playing
an
important
role
in
a
world
without
physical
borders
to
sum
up
technology
has
had
a
massive
positive
impact
on
people
s
lives
changing
the
economic
educational
and
familial
landscapes
in
ways
that
were
once
unimaginable
with
the
continuing
advancement
of
technology
it
is
likely
these
effects
will
become
even
more
pronounced
in
the
years
to
come
the
idea
of
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
during
lunch
and
free
time
in
middle
school
has
been
discussed
among
many
educational
professionals
by
allowing
this
practice
schools
could
provide
a
sense
of
convenience
for
teachers
yet
this
policy
could
be
accompanied
with
certain
drawbacks
on
the
plus
side
letting
students
use
their
phones
in
school
could
be
beneficial
to
both
the
students
and
teachers
with
a
policy
in
place
students
will
be
able
to
converse
and
interact
with
their
peers
and
it
would
be
easier
for
teachers
to
communicate
with
their
students
additionally
the
use
of
communication
apps
and
online
resources
could
be
used
by
students
to
study
and
do
research
on
the
other
hand
what
must
also
be
considered
is
the
cost
of
implementation
without
proper
funding
and
resources
this
policy
would
be
difficult
to
implement
and
monitor
since
it
would
be
hard
for
teachers
to
make
sure
that
students
are
maintaining
a
healthy
balance
between
work
and
leisure
furthermore
this
policy
could
also
have
an
effect
on
student
behavior
since
brief
exchanges
during
meals
or
free
time
could
easily
disrupt
classroom
activities
and
even
lead
to
disruptions
in
the
learning
environment
overall
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
come
with
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
during
lunch
and
free
time
in
middle
school
while
it
could
provide
some
convenience
and
benefits
it
is
important
to
make
sure
that
the
consequences
of
such
a
policy
are
taken
into
consideration
as
well
when
setting
goals
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
considering
a
wide
range
of
goals
from
very
low
to
very
high
to
ensure
a
thorough
examination
of
the
issue
i
will
construct
an
outline
for
my
argument
advocating
the
idea
that
setting
high
goals
is
beneficial
involves
citing
the
multiple
positive
outcomes
such
as
motivation
to
actually
reach
the
goal
an
increased
sense
of
accomplishment
when
the
goal
is
achieved
and
the
ambition
to
reach
beyond
set
expectations
moreover
setting
high
goals
can
also
help
push
individuals
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
resulting
in
increased
levels
of
creativity
and
problem
solving
setting
high
goals
also
gives
individuals
a
level
of
purpose
that
comes
from
working
hard
to
set
and
attain
a
goal
they
believe
in
of
course
setting
high
goals
also
comes
with
certain
drawbacks
some
individuals
may
become
overly
ambitious
to
the
point
where
the
goal
is
no
longer
achievable
this
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
confidence
and
a
sense
of
disappointment
if
the
goal
is
not
met
moreover
setting
high
goals
can
also
cause
stress
as
the
individual
works
to
meet
the
goal
s
expectations
after
outlining
my
argument
to
support
the
notion
that
setting
high
goals
is
beneficial
i
will
double
check
for
any
grammar
or
spelling
errors
that
might
exist
extending
the
school
day
two
hours
and
four
days
a
week
has
potential
benefits
as
well
as
potential
drawbacks
from
a
resource
conservation
standpoint
extending
the
school
day
could
help
to
reduce
the
gaps
between
classes
conserve
energy
and
lessen
the
need
for
additional
buses
and
vehicles
for
transport
additionally
it
could
potentially
provide
additional
time
for
students
to
explore
and
get
involved
in
extracurricular
activities
giving
them
extra
opportunities
to
engage
and
learn
outside
of
the
classroom
on
the
other
hand
increasing
the
length
of
the
school
day
could
have
a
negative
effect
on
students
mental
and
physical
health
school
days
could
lead
to
higher
levels
of
stress
and
exhaustion
as
well
as
more
difficulty
managing
workloads
furthermore
the
additional
hours
spent
in
school
could
significantly
reduce
students
free
time
and
availability
for
social
activities
which
can
be
detrimental
to
adolescents
developmental
needs
in
conclusion
while
extending
the
school
day
four
days
a
week
could
potentially
bring
many
benefits
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
and
implications
for
students
mental
and
physical
health
careful
assessment
should
be
taken
to
ensure
that
any
decisions
made
are
beneficial
to
the
students
and
school
in
the
long term
i
believe
that
deciding
to
lengthen
school
hours
is
not
a
good
decision
from
my
personal
experiences
i
can
tell
that
extending
the
amount
of
time
spent
at
school
would
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
overall
well being
and
mental
health
of
both
students
and
teachers
many
adolescents
battle
stress
lack
of
sleep
and
other
issues
related
to
their
mental
health
and
a
longer
school
day
could
make
provide
difficult
for
them
to
manage
these
issues
similarly
teachers
would
be
overworked
and
overstressed
by
having
to
teach
during
longer
hours
leading
to
a
decrease
in
the
quality
of
their
job
performance
rather
than
extending
school
hours
i
believe
that
it
would
be
beneficial
to
re evaluate
the
traditional
curricular
design
and
increase
the
amount
of
breaks
during
the
day
allowing
for
shorter
classes
more
recess
and
longer
lunch
breaks
can
help
students
acquire
the
skills
and
knowledge
they
need
without
putting
an
extra
burden
on
their
mental
health
taking
more
breaks
helps
improve
productivity
significantly
and
this
could
be
beneficial
both
for
students
and
teachers
as
teenagers
it
is
important
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
learn
from
our
mistakes
allowing
for
mistakes
to
be
made
and
learning
from
them
gives
us
a
greater
sense
of
freedom
and
control
over
our
lives
and
provides
us
with
invaluable
life
lessons
that
we
may
not
receive
from
following
the
advice
of
others
making
our
own
decisions
allows
us
to
have
a
greater
sense
of
independence
and
ownership
of
our
mistakes
this
enables
us
to
become
more
aware
of
our
own
values
and
beliefs
and
helps
us
to
develop
our
own
identity
it
also
encourages
us
to
take
responsibility
for
our
own
actions
rather
than
relying
on
the
advice
of
others
making
our
own
decisions
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
experience
new
things
and
try
new
things
which
can
help
us
to
grow
and
develop
as
individuals
taking
risks
and
trying
something
new
teaches
us
more
about
ourselves
and
leads
to
experiences
that
could
not
be
gained
from
following
advice
making
our
own
decisions
also
teaches
us
valuable
life
lessons
that
can
not
be
received
from
relying
solely
on
the
advice
of
adults
when
we
are
allowed
to
make
our
own
decisions
we
learn
how
to
handle
successes
and
failures
without
relying
on
external
sources
we
are
able
to
learn
our
personal
limits
and
form
our
own
opinions
about
what
we
deem
successful
or
unsuccessful
we
become
more
resilient
and
are
able
to
develop
confidence
in
our
own
decisions
and
abilities
without
the
opportunity
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
learn
from
our
mistakes
teenagers
can
not
gain
knowledge
of
the
consequences
of
our
actions
and
develop
an
understanding
of
our
own
values
and
views
learning
from
our
mistakes
rather
than
relying
on
the
advice
of
adults
helps
teenagers
become
responsible
independent
individuals
that
can
make
appropriate
decisions
every
day
people
make
decisions
about
their
lives
and
futures
sometimes
without
seeking
expert
guidance
making
your
own
decisions
can
be
both
liberating
and
empowering
since
you
are
the
sole
responsible
for
the
outcome
on
one
hand
it
can
bring
forth
new
ideas
that
may
be
more
successful
than
relying
on
an
expert
personal
opinion
can
be
a
powerful
influence
as
it
can
shape
the
choice
and
decision
being
made
coupled
with
a
solid
research
making
your
own
decisions
can
be
highly
valuable
and
beneficial
on
the
other
hand
making
decisions
without
expert
guidance
can
also
be
a
double edged
sword
taking
risks
without
proper
knowledge
can
also
result
in
failures
which
in
turn
could
lead
to
negative
consequences
how
the
personal
choices
and
decisions
made
today
will
affect
or
shape
the
future
is
another
area
of
consideration
overall
making
your
own
decisions
has
its
pros
and
cons
each
individual
must
weigh
the
merits
and
demerits
and
arrive
at
the
best
possible
solution
after
planning
our
trip
to
for
months
the
day
had
finally
arrived
my
siblings
and
i
were
bursting
with
excitement
and
so
were
our
grandparents
we
wanted
to
make
the
most
of
our
family
reunion
so
decided
to
explore
all
that
the
city
had
to
offer
we
spent
a
morning
at
the
beach
soaking
up
the
sun
swimming
in
the
pool
and
having
a
picnic
lunch
on
the
shore
we
roasted
marshmallows
and
made
smores
over
a
fire
and
shared
our
favorite
childhood
memories
with
each
other
the
adrenaline
rush
of
skydiving
was
unforgettable
we
all
felt
like
our
feet
had
left
the
ground
we
watched
as
each
other
s
faces
lit
up
captured
in
our
memories
forever
the
beautiful
ancient
sights
of
were
mesmerizing
we
watched
the
sun
dip
behind
the
mountains
and
shared
stories
of
the
ancient
civilization
that
once
lived
there
we
rode
camels
and
horses
and
took
pictures
to
remember
our
incredible
journey
our
time
in
was
an
unforgettable
reunion
we
left
feeling
closer
than
ever
with
memories
that
will
stay
with
us
forever
attending
a
four
year
high
school
rather
than
a
three
year
one
can
offer
a
wealth
of
educational
opportunities
and
experiences
by
spending
an
additional
year
students
have
more
time
to
take
challenging
classes
explore
their
interests
and
get
involved
in
various
activities
they
can
also
hone
their
skills
in
areas
such
as
writing
communication
and
problem solving
which
are
invaluable
tools
in
college
and
beyond
the
extra
year
provides
an
opportunity
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
career
pathways
and
build
connections
with
professionals
in
the
field
with
a
comprehensive
and
well rounded
education
four
year
high
school
helps
set
the
foundation
for
a
successful
future
has
long
been
seen
as
an
important
factor
in
achieving
success
after
all
it
s
great
to
have
a
goal
of
succeeding
but
it
takes
enthusiasm
and
passion
to
actually
take
the
steps
necessary
to
reach
that
success
when
someone
is
fueled
by
their
passion
and
inner
drive
their
enthusiasm
usually
translates
into
hard
work
and
dedication
to
drive
this
point
home
let
us
look
at
some
inspiring
examples
of
how
enthusiasm
has
helped
people
or
organizations
to
achieve
great
success
one
example
can
be
seen
in
the
rise
of
tech
giants
like
or
both
companies
started
out
with
a
team
of
individuals
with
a
common
goal
provide
innovative
and
user friendly
technology
to
people
around
the
world
to
do
so
they
had
to
work
with
enthusiasm
and
dedication
to
build
their
products
and
bring
them
to
the
market
their
enthusiasm
and
hard
work
paid
off
and
now
and
are
among
the
most
successful
and
well known
companies
in
the
world
successful
entrepreneurs
and
philanthropists
are
also
an
example
of
how
enthusiasm
can
lead
to
success
for
instance
devoted
himself
to
his
charitable
work
with
immense
enthusiasm
and
his
organization
has
contributed
immensely
to
the
betterment
of
society
this
shows
that
success
is
not
always
correlated
to
fame
and
fortune
but
rather
to
how
much
effort
someone
can
put
in
with
enthusiasm
clearly
the
examples
provided
here
are
only
a
few
of
many
nevertheless
it
is
clear
that
having
enthusiasm
and
passion
is
a
key
ingredient
for
success
it
can
help
drive
an
individual
or
an
organization
to
work
towards
their
goal
with
dedication
until
they
finally
obtain
the
success
that
they
are
aiming
for
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
of
learning
from
the
experiences
of
others
is
that
it
can
provide
a
shortcut
to
success
by
examining
the
successes
and
struggles
of
those
that
came
before
us
we
can
gain
invaluable
insight
into
how
to
approach
and
overcome
the
common
challenges
of
success
this
kind
of
wisdom
can
be
shared
and
can
promote
personal
growth
and
help
us
achieve
our
goals
shared
experiences
can
also
create
connections
and
solidarity
when
we
open
up
to
other
people
about
our
personal
successes
and
struggles
it
can
help
us
form
meaningful
relationships
which
can
be
a
source
of
support
and
inspiration
however
although
learning
from
others
can
help
greatly
ultimate
success
still
largely
depends
on
hard
work
and
dedication
seeing
the
success
of
someone
else
may
motivate
us
to
strive
for
our
own
but
to
actually
achieve
our
goals
it
is
necessary
to
put
in
the
necessary
effort
thus
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
importance
of
our
own
hard
work
and
never
give
up
attending
classes
from
home
provides
a
unique
learning
experience
compared
to
attending
classes
in
person
on
the
plus
side
students
can
enjoy
a
more
relaxed
less
stressful
environment
without
having
to
worry
about
getting
to
school
on
time
or
dealing
with
the
social
pressures
of
the
classroom
additionally
students
have
access
to
a
wealth
of
learning
resources
on
the
internet
and
can
utilize
technology
like
video
conferencing
to
interact
with
their
peers
and
teachers
however
there
are
also
drawbacks
to
learning
from
home
without
the
structure
and
support
of
a
traditional
school
setting
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
stay
focused
and
set
a
daily
study
schedule
it
can
also
be
isolating
since
students
don
t
have
the
same
sense
of
community
they
would
have
when
they
attend
classes
in
person
students
attending
classes
from
home
can
be
more
easily
distracted
by
other
tasks
and
activities
that
can
take
away
from
their
learning
and
progress
in
conclusion
while
attending
classes
from
home
can
offer
increased
flexibility
and
access
to
learning
resources
it
also
poses
some
unique
challenges
that
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
focus
and
succeed
therefore
it
is
important
for
students
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
learning
from
home
before
deciding
on
whether
or
not
it
is
the
right
choice
for
them
success
is
often
achieved
through
hard
work
dedication
focus
and
discipline
but
failure
is
also
an
important
part
of
the
journey
many
successful
scientists
students
entrepreneurs
and
social
media
influencers
have
found
a
path
to
success
through
their
experiences
of
failure
famously
said
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
won
t
work
he
was
willing
to
take
risks
and
learn
from
his
mistakes
to
invent
the
light
bulb
similarly
student
athletes
learn
that
while
failure
can
be
devastating
it
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
become
better
players
teammates
and
people
the
same
can
be
said
of
entrepreneurs
who
must
try
fail
adjust
and
try
again
learning
valuable
lessons
along
the
way
social
media
is
another
avenue
through
which
success
is
achieved
many
influencers
have
achieved
success
overnight
yet
this
will
usually
only
last
as
long
as
the
hype
those
who
combine
skill
with
persistence
failure
and
determination
are
more
likely
to
become
successful
in
the
long
term
learning
from
failure
enables
us
to
make
smarter
decisions
and
consider
different
plans
of
action
leading
to
greater
success
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
s
plan
to
add
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
must
be
carefully
analyzed
on
the
positive
side
the
additional
school
time
may
allow
for
the
implementation
of
a
wider
range
of
courses
granting
greater
educational
opportunities
for
all
students
however
the
extra
time
may
put
a
strain
on
already
limited
resources
such
as
teacher student
ratios
or
gymnasiums
and
playgrounds
furthermore
the
extra
school
time
could
lead
to
further
stress
for
teachers
students
and
parents
alike
and
with
it
a
possible
negative
impact
on
student teacher
relationships
moreover
an
increased
school
day
could
result
in
students
feeling
more
exhausted
leading
to
burnout
and
overall
decreased
well being
ultimately
the
s
proposal
must
be
assessed
on
a
case by case
basis
factoring
in
all
of
the
relevant
stakeholders
it
is
often
said
that
actions
speak
louder
than
words
and
indeed
setting
a
good
example
through
one
s
own
behavior
and
choices
can
be
an
effective
way
to
influence
other
people
demonstrating
the
desired
behavior
or
attitude
can
show
others
what
is
valued
and
expected
and
provides
them
with
a
template
for
following
that
example
however
there
may
be
more
impactful
and
direct
ways
to
influence
those
around
us
speaking
openly
and
persuasively
on
the
issue
is
one
key
way
to
influence
others
by
engaging
in
discussion
or
debate
we
can
both
present
evidence
for
a
particular
point
of
view
and
invite
counter arguments
doing
so
can
help
to
spark
ideas
and
challenge
perspectives
in
a
way
that
simply
modeling
the
desired
behavior
may
not
furthermore
addressing
a
wide
variety
of
individuals
allows
a
message
to
reach
diverse
audiences
and
to
be
tailored
in
a
way
that
increases
its
persuasive
power
in
some
cases
a
combination
of
behavior
and
discussion
may
be
the
most
effective
method
of
influencing
others
by
providing
an
example
to
follow
and
discussing
why
it
is
being
pursued
it
is
possible
to
shape
the
thoughts
and
beliefs
of
those
around
us
ultimately
the
best
approach
may
arise
from
an
understanding
of
the
individual
s
needs
and
preferences
while
setting
a
good
example
is
one
reliable
method
there
may
be
better
ways
to
influence
other
people
depending
on
the
situation
online
classes
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
and
can
open
up
many
opportunities
to
those
who
wish
to
pursue
higher
education
on
the
plus
side
they
provide
flexible
scheduling
allowing
students
to
study
and
attend
classes
at
times
that
work
best
for
their
individual
lifestyle
classes
also
enable
students
to
pursue
their
desired
degree
or
certification
without
being
physically
present
in
a
classroom
additionally
students
may
not
have
to
pay
any
extra
fees
for
online
courses
making
the
potential
for
savings
great
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
drawbacks
that
come
with
online
classes
as
well
for
example
some
courses
may
be
more
difficult
to
grasp
without
the
help
of
an
instructor
present
in
the
classroom
there
may
also
be
challenges
that
come
with
studying
alone
as
students
must
find
motivation
and
stay
organized
to
complete
coursework
in
addition
a
lack
of
face to face
interaction
with
peers
can
make
it
difficult
to
ask
questions
and
discuss
ideas
freely
the
art
of
making
music
drama
and
other
forms
of
artistic
expression
are
essential
in
helping
to
shape
a
country
s
culture
research
has
shown
that
when
students
participate
in
art
and
music
classes
they
tend
to
perform
better
academically
and
have
higher
test
scores
since
competition
is
a
factor
in
motivating
them
furthermore
the
music
and
art
produced
by
a
country
has
often
been
seen
as
a
public
representation
of
its
culture
for
instance
someone
living
in
will
be
influenced
by
the
american
music
standards
such
as
jazz
hip
hop
and
rap
which
can
be
rooted
back
to
the
african
diaspora
longstanding
authors
actors
and
artists
have
managed
to
make
a
career
out
of
their
crafts
by
way
of
passion
hard
work
and
dedication
for
example
became
a
successful
author
of
the
series
after
several
publishers
rejected
her
manuscript
but
her
persistence
and
boldness
resulted
in
her
becoming
one
of
the
most
renowned
authors
of
her
generation
similarly
renowned
actress
managed
to
achieve
success
and
acclaim
with
her
brilliant
talent
and
versatility
as
an
actor
despite
her
lack
of
formal
education
and
professional
training
making
art
music
and
drama
classes
mandatory
in
schools
will
not
only
benefit
the
nation
s
culture
but
will
also
help
contribute
to
a
student
s
sense
of
motivation
in
their
studies
researching
the
pros
and
cons
of
accelerated
high
school
experiences
has
become
increasingly
relevant
for
today
s
teens
students
who
have
accelerated
their
high
school
experience
and
succeeded
and
those
who
have
failed
have
provided
valuable
case
studies
and
insights
into
the
challenges
armed
and
unprepared
students
can
face
successful
students
have
often
cited
the
acceleration
of
their
high
school
experience
as
providing
them
with
an
opportunity
to
get
ahead
in
college
before
their
peers
for
instance
students
who
graduate
early
may
be
able
to
begin
college
with
a
major
or
focus
on
a
field
of
study
before
other
students
who
are
just
entering
college
on
the
other
hand
however
unprepared
and
ill advised
students
who
have
accelerated
their
high
school
experience
have
found
themselves
facing
difficulties
such
as
ill preparedness
for
college
level
classes
struggling
to
make
friends
and
missing
out
on
high
school
experiences
and
events
it
is
important
to
consider
these
implications
for
the
future
of
education
and
ensure
that
adolescents
are
properly
informed
and
advised
when
considering
accelerating
their
high
school
experience
with
the
right
knowledge
support
and
preparation
these
students
can
tap
into
the
opportunities
that
accelerated
high
school
can
provide
while
avoiding
the
pitfalls
of
inexperience
and
insufficient
preparation
is
truly
an
extraordinary
place
with
plenty
for

to
discover

you
buy
some
ingredients
and
cook
a
delicious
meal
at

your
culinary
experience
in
will
be
a
memorable
one
but
above
all
what
makes
an
excellent
place
to
visit
is
its
welcoming
culture
whether

overall
is
an
amazing
place
to
visit
with
its
lush
parks
delightful
cuisine
and
its
unique
culture
it
s
no
wonder
why
has
become
such
a
popular
destination
this
is
why
is
truly
an
amazing
place
to
experience
and
explore
a
four day
work
week
with
ten hour
days
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
students
with
part time
jobs
if
this
change
is
implemented
they
will
need
to
adjust
their
schedules
accordingly
which
can
be
difficult
as
schools
typically
offer
courses
through
for
energy
and
resource
conservation
having
four
days
with
ten
hours
could
be
beneficial
compared
to
five
days
with
eight
hours
although
there
could
be
potential
advantages
to
a
four day
workweek
some
drawbacks
should
also
be
considered
fatigue
could
be
an
issue
as
classes
would
be
longer
and
more
intense
and
some
students
might
have
difficulty
managing
their
courses
work
and
personal
obligations
with
the
added
hours
some
jobs
may
not
be
available
on
weekends
and
could
cause
disruptions
in
students
finances
if
their
usual
work
day
off
is
changed
research
has
shown
that
playing
sports
can
have
numerous
educational
and
social
benefits
to
individuals
and
teams
studies
have
shown
that
when
children
are
regularly
playing
sports
their
academic
performance
tends
to
improve
as
well
it
has
been
theorized
that
taking
part
in
physical
activity
leads
to
better
concentration
and
a
higher
ability
to
focus
on
studies
moreover
playing
sports
can
lead
to
increased
self esteem
and
better
communication
and
teamwork
with
peers
as
sports
activities
bring
together
different
people
to
collaborate
to
reach
the
same
goal
teamwork
is
a
key
concept
in
competitive
sports
as
it
provides
support
for
players
while
enabling
them
to
learn
how
to
cooperate
and
make
decisions
together
through
teamwork
sports
teams
are
able
to
bond
and
build
trust
allowing
them
to
work
together
more
effectively
on
and
off
the
field
statistics
have
proven
that
teams
that
emphasize
team
work
tend
to
have
greater
success
for
example
the
the
practiced
rigorous
team
building
activities
in
order
to
enhance
their
performance
on
the
field
these
activities
such
as
developing
a
team
motto
wearing
matching
uniforms
and
motivating
each
other
with
teamwork
slogans
arguably
contributed
to
the
team
s
success
similarly
sprinter
attributed
much
of
his
success
and
multiple
gold
medal
wins
to
his
strong
team
work
approach
starting
from
a
young
age
we
are
often
taught
that
failure
is
not
an
option
and
that
trying
and
eventually
failing
is
considered
a
sign
of
defeat
however
i
believe
that
failure
can
actually
help
one
be
successful
as
famously
said
is
the
ability
to
go
from
failure
to
failure
without
losing
enthusiasm
failure
can
make
one
stronger
in
both
a
mental
and
physical
sense
it
shows
you
that
you
ca
n t
rely
on
external
factors
to
get
the
outcome
you
desire
it
also
forces
you
to
dig
deep
within
and
find
strength
you
were
unaware
of
before
this
is
a
crucial
trait
for
anyone
wanting
to
truly
become
successful
failure
also
has
another
more
immediate
benefit
it
teaches
you
not
to
make
the
same
mistake
again
it
helps
you
assess
the
situation
more
deeply
understand
what
went
wrong
and
how
you
can
adjust
your
behavior
and
strategies
in
the
future
through
this
you
gain
more
knowledge
and
learn
to
become
more
mindful
when
deciding
how
to
act
or
go
about
achieving
your
goals
finally
failure
can
help
you
find
the
right
path
to
success
this
is
because
no
successful
person
ever
got
what
they
wanted
on
the
first
try
is
built
upon
a
series
of
trial
and
error
so
through
failure
we
can
assess
and
understand
the
roadblocks
and
with
perseverance
and
determination
create
a
plan
or
approach
that
will
eventually
get
us
to
where
we
desire
to
go
in
conclusion
failure
should
not
be
seen
as
the
end
but
rather
a
part
of
the
process
to
success
through
failure
we
can
become
stronger
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
find
the
right
path
to
success
as
so
wisely
said
is
the
ability
to
go
from
failure
to
failure
without
losing
enthusiasm
in
a
world
increasingly
driven
by
technology
the
use
of
online
and
video
conferencing
technologies
for
distance
learning
can
be
a
game changer
for
students
not
only
can
virtual
learning
offer
students
convenient
flexible
access
to
educational
institutions
and
resources
it
can
also
provide
the
focus
and
commitment
to
learning
that
is
necessary
for
success
in
today
s
hothoused
academic
world
by
attending
online
classes
students
can
stay
connected
to
their
peers
while
also
staying
on
task
allowing
them
to
avoid
procrastination
and
distraction
doing
so
will
foster
a
sense
of
personal
discipline
and
prepare
students
for
the
challenging
demands
of
the
future
moreover
distance
learning
options
often
involve
interactive
tools
and
activities
that
can
help
keep
students
engaged
inspired
and
motivated
despite
the
advantages
of
distance
learning
it
s
important
to
note
that
it
also
has
its
drawbacks
it
is
often
difficult
for
students
to
form
meaningful
connections
with
their
peers
in
a
virtual
environment
and
the
lack
of
personal
interaction
can
be
discouraging
additionally
the
sense
of
isolation
can
be
a
major
barrier
for
many
online
learners
particularly
those
who
do
n t
have
strong
personal
relationships
that
can
help
them
stay
on
track
and
motivated
in
their
studies
ultimately
though
the
benefits
of
virtual
learning
far
outweigh
the
disadvantages
in
the
fast changing
world
we
live
in
students
who
take
advantage
of
online
and
video
conferencing
options
for
distance
learning
have
the
best
chance
of
staying
on
task
and
having
a
successful
future
ahead
as
the
saying
goes
it
s
not
a
matter
of
if
you
will
fail
but
when
this
is
because
in
order
to
be
truly
successful
we
must
first
persevere
through
failure
take
the
athlete
for
example
no
matter
how
much
natural
talent
an
athlete
may
have
they
will
not
reach
elite
status
without
putting
in
countless
hours
of
rigorous
training
and
enduring
untold
failures
and
mistakes
along
the
way
each
time
the
athlete
falls
short
of
their
goal
they
must
evaluate
their
performance
adjust
their
methods
and
press
forward
only
by
embracing
failure
and
learning
from
it
can
an
athlete
progress
or
take
a
young
entrepreneur
launching
a
new
business
venture
rather
than
fearing
failure
they
must
campaign
forward
willing
to
make
mistakes
and
learn
along
the
way
one
famous
example
of
this
is
the
co founder
of
after
his
founding
team
was
terminated
and
the
company
s
projects
were
deemed
unsuccessful
rose
once
again
and
pushed
through
ultimately
gaining
success
in
the
long
run
in
conclusion
failure
is
not
a
dead
end
nor
a
sign
of
weakness
it
is
simply
a
portion
of
the
path
to
success
it
is
only
through
actively
engaging
in
failures
and
learning
from
them
that
we
can
ultimately
create
the
triumphant
success
we
strive
for
many
people
find
themselves
in
positions
with
varying
degrees
of
influence
over
their
lives
decisions
friends
with
similar
interests
and
good
examples
for
others
all
have
the
potential
to
shape
one
s
future
goals
and
successes
making
smart
decisions
especially
as
it
relates
to
one
s
future
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
having
friends
with
similar
interests
allows
for
collaboration
and
support
when
it
comes
to
achieving
goals
finally
setting
a
good
example
for
others
can
not
only
help
influence
their
goals
but
also
help
them
to
internalize
healthy
habits
and
patterns
that
can
ultimately
lead
to
a
more
positive
and
successful
future
as
evidenced
by
these
examples
having
the
right
influences
in
one
s
life
can
have
long reaching
implications
and
be
incredibly
beneficial
even
on
a
global
scale
allowing
students
to
choose
their
own
extracurricular
activities
offers
many
potential
benefits
including
the
ability
to
pursue
passions
and
develop
skills
that
may
otherwise
be
inaccessible
furthermore
students
can
use
their
time
in
extracurricular
activities
to
engage
with
their
peers
build
relationships
and
explore
their
talents
on
the
other
hand
schools
controlling
a
student
s
participation
in
extracurricular
activities
can
bring
an
element
of
structure
to
the
student
s
life
and
ensure
that
activities
are
consistent
with
the
school
s
values
and
goals
while
this
approach
may
help
students
discover
new
interests
or
discover
a
career
path
it
does
limit
a
student
s
potential
to
explore
and
develop
their
own
passions
in
my
opinion
schools
should
provide
guidance
to
students
on
what
constitutes
a
healthy
and
beneficial
extracurricular
activity
while
also
allowing
space
for
students
to
explore
activities
that
interest
them
this
approach
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
explore
a
variety
of
interests
while
also
ensuring
that
their
extracurricular
activities
are
aligned
with
the
school
s
values
in
recent
years
the
idea
of
a
four day
work
week
has
gained
traction
in
an
ever increasing
number
of
businesses
and
schools
under
this
structure
employees
and
students
would
no
longer
work
or
attend
classes
for
five
days
a
week
but
instead
reduce
the
number
of
hours
necessary
for
a
full
workload
to
four
days
per
week
while
some
speculate
that
such
a
structure
would
increase
productivity
there
are
still
a
number
of
areas
that
need
to
be
considered
before
implementation
when
researching
the
effects
of
a
four day
week
it
is
important
to
look
at
both
the
potential
benefits
and
the
responsibilities
that
come
with
it
for
businesses
a
four day
work
week
could
help
save
money
on
salary
costs
and
overhead
costs
students
may
also
see
an
uptick
in
their
academic
and
social
performance
as
the
extra
day
off
could
lead
to
improved
focus
while
in
class
and
offer
time
to
participate
in
other
activities
such
as
athletics
and
contribute
to
hobbies
outside
of
class
however
a
four day
school
week
would
also
mean
longer
days
for
students
though
reducing
the
workweek
from
five
to
four
days
could
potentially
benefit
both
businesses
and
students
it
is
important
to
fully
analyze
the
potential
effects
of
a
four day
school
week
it
is
necessary
to
consider
both
the
positive
and
negative
consequences
of
such
a
change
along
with
its
impacts
on
the
environment
in
order
to
determine
if
it
truly
could
benefit
students
both
in
and
outside
of
school
one
of
the
main
reasons
to
consider
getting
multiple
opinions
when
making
a
decision
is
to
get
a
better
idea
of
all
available
choices
when
we
take
the
time
to
consult
with
different
people
and
listen
to
their
perspectives
we
can
come
up
with
a
larger
variety
of
solutions
to
any
given
problem
for
instance
when
i
faced
a
dilemma
between
taking
two
opportunities
that
were
both
good
options
getting
multiple
opinions
allowed
me
to
better
understand
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
one
this
gave
me
a
better
idea
of
which
option
would
be
better
for
me
in
the
long
run
another
advantage
of
seeking
multiple
opinions
is
that
it
can
give
us
more
choices
to
choose
from
by
hearing
out
different
ideas
and
exploring
different
approaches
to
a
problem
we
can
come
up
with
more
options
than
we
would
have
thought
of
on
our
own
this
was
the
case
when
i
had
to
decide
between
two
very
different
paths
to
pursue
after
graduating
high
school
consulting
with
multiple
people
exposed
me
to
a
variety
of
perspectives
which
helped
me
to
discover
new
opportunities
that
i
wouldn
t
have
been
aware
of
otherwise
lastly
getting
multiple
opinions
can
provide
us
with
the
confidence
we
need
to
make
a
good
decision
when
we
hear
out
a
variety
of
opinions
it
often
gives
us
the
assurance
needed
to
make
the
right
call
this
was
true
for
me
when
deciding
which
college
to
attend
by
talking
with
other
people
i
was
able
to
gain
the
clarity
that
was
necessary
for
me
to
trust
myself
and
make
the
best
choice
in
conclusion
getting
multiple
opinions
when
making
a
decision
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
it
can
provide
us
with
a
better
understanding
of
all
available
choices
more
options
to
choose
from
and
the
confidence
needed
to
make
a
good
decision
we
live
in
a
world
where
teenagers
are
pressured
to
decide
their
profession
long
before
they
can
have
a
full
understanding
of
the
variety
of
occupational
paths
available
to
them
requiring
high
school
students
to
identify
their
future
career
can
lead
to
poor
decision making
unnecessary
stress
and
a
lack
of
exploration
of
potential
opportunities
has
shown
that
when
students
are
left
to
their
own
explorations
and
interests
after
graduating
high
school
they
create
paths
more
suited
to
their
natural
abilities
and
strengths
examples
of
successful
individuals
who
eschewed
traditional
norms
to
find
success
include
who
dropped
out
of
after
launching
and
who
wrote
her
first
novel
while
unemployed
as
a
single
mother
such
success
stories
demonstrate
the
incredible
possibilities
that
can
arise
when
students
are
given
the
freedom
to
pursue
a
personal
career
journey
without
feeling
constrained
by
preset
requirements
in
conclusion
pressuring
teenagers
to
determine
their
career
path
before
they
have
had
the
chance
to
explore
other
options
may
have
negative
consequences
that
can
hinder
their
future
prospects
it
is
important
to
create
a
supportive
environment
that
allows
young
people
to
openly
explore
different
career
paths
and
discover
the
one
that
is
best
suited
for
them
it
is
no
secret
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
to
achieve
success
in
life
not
only
is
it
important
to
develop
positive
characteristics
within
ourselves
but
it
is
vital
to
display
this
positivity
when
interacting
with
those
around
us
having
a
positive
attitude
can
play
a
big
role
in
career
success
few
employers
want
to
work
with
someone
who
can
always
be
found
complaining
about
tasks
or
not
taking
the
initiative
a
positive
attitude
gives
off
a
great
first
impression
to
any
employer
and
can
help
to
open
up
potential
job
opportunities
it
also
projects
the
idea
of
someone
being
reliable
and
hardworking
two
qualities
often
sought
after
by
employers
interacting
with
others
in
a
positive
manner
can
also
show
an
individual
s
respect
for
them
and
their
views
having
a
positive
attitude
towards
those
around
us
can
help
us
to
make
connections
that
could
ultimately
lead
to
further
success
it
also
helps
to
maintain
a
healthy
sense
of
teamwork
in
a
workplace
or
environment
on
the
other
hand
having
a
negative
attitude
or
outlook
can
have
consequences
on
both
our
attitude
and
our
reputation
people
who
are
overly
negative
can
push
away
potential
friends
partners
or
co workers
as
they
might
be
seen
as
difficult
to
be
around
if
the
attitude
continues
it
can
even
lead
to
feeling
isolated
and
alone
which
can
be
difficult
to
bounce
back
from
staying
positive
and
having
a
good
attitude
is
one
key
factor
in
achieving
success
in
life
not
only
will
it
help
to
attract
opportunities
but
it
will
also
create
good
relationships
with
people
around
us
and
allow
us
to
be
successful
in
all
facets
of
life
a
positive
outlook
can
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
and
should
be
embraced
attending
classes
at
a
school
has
a
variety
of
benefits
that
distance
learning
can
not
quite
match
students
attending
classes
in
a
school
have
the
opportunity
to
interact
with
their
peers
as
they
learn
in
a
communal
setting
this
helps
to
both
engage
them
more
deeply
in
their
lessons
through
discussion
and
also
helps
foster
important
social
skills
additionally
teachers
are
available
in
person
to
provide
insight
and
aid
in
understanding
concepts
conversely
distance
learning
has
its
own
set
of
advantages
that
can
make
it
a
worthwhile
option
it
allows
greater
flexibility
in
terms
of
scheduling
as
students
have
the
opportunity
to
structure
their
own
learning
environment
and
access
materials
when
it
works
best
for
them
distance
learning
also
provides
students
with
the
opportunity
to
learn
digital
skills
as
they
can
become
comfortable
with
utilizing
technology
for
their
studies
ultimately
both
school
and
distance
learning
have
valuable
benefits
and
can
be
utilized
to
fit
individual
needs
believed
in
the
power
of
expansion
he
believed
that
a
person
who
had
already
mastered
a
skill
should
constantly
expand
their
horizons
and
acquire
new
skills
i
agree
as
i
think
doing
so
can
help
open
up
new
opportunities
and
provide
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
accomplishment
additionally
expanding
one
s
horizons
allows
for
a
better
understanding
of
how
different
skills
fit
together
for
example
if
someone
has
mastered
the
art
of
computer
programming
but
decides
to
also
learn
web
design
they
may
be
able
to
see
ways
in
which
the
two
skills
can
combine
and
create
something
completely
new
that
said
expanding
horizons
can
also
have
its
challenges
if
someone
has
already
mastered
a
skill
and
is
used
to
succeeding
quickly
learning
something
new
can
be
difficult
and
frustrating
if
progress
is
slow
additionally
it
can
be
difficult
to
dedicate
the
time
needed
to
learn
something
new
when
someone
is
already
busy
with
their
job
and
personal
life
ultimately
i
believe
expanding
one
s
horizons
through
learning
something
new
can
be
beneficial
as
long
as
one
approaches
it
with
a
positive
mindset
and
is
patient
with
the
progress
there
may
be
challenges
but
the
potential
rewards
can
be
incredibly
worthwhile
the
advantages
of
embarking
on
a
career
at
an
early
age
are
undeniable
young
people
will
benefit
from
exploring
their
interests
and
developing
relevant
skills
in
their
field
of
choice
so
they
can
decide
if
it
is
the
right
career
match
for
them
additionally
a
high
school
diploma
or
may
be
sufficient
for
many
entry level
jobs
so
taking
the
steps
to
become
career ready
early
can
eventually
lead
to
better
job
opportunities
and
potential
salary
increases
fortunately
there
are
many
educational
resources
available
to
those
who
want
to
get
a
head
start
on
their
careers
offered
in
schools
or
through
the
community
can
be
a
great
way
to
gain
experience
and
knowledge
in
a
specific
field
as
requirements
usually
vary
between
offering
organizations
for
example
many
career
programs
in
high
schools
allow
students
to
gain
on the job
exposure
of
different
industries
and
fields
of
work
while
some
community based
organizations
may
include
a
requirement
to
volunteer
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
within
a
certain
field
in
conclusion
embarking
on
a
career
at
an
early
age
can
be
beneficial
to
young
people
looking
to
gain
meaningful
work
experience
and
skills
and
program
requirements
vary
widely
among
different
organizations
with
the
right
educational
resources
embarking
on
a
career
at
an
early
age
can
be
a
great
stepping
stone
towards
success
here
are
some
relevant
talking
points
to
discuss
when
applying
for
a
job
in
the
medical
industry
medical
knowledge
and
expertise
gained
through
studying
and or
working
in
the
medical
field
ability
to
work
calmly
and
reliably
in
emergency
and
high pressure
situations
ability
to
identify
potential
problems
quickly
and
devise
appropriate
solutions
skilled
in
working
with
both
individuals
and
teams
as
needed
familiarity
with
complex
medical
terminology
and
procedures
working
knowledge
of
health
insurance
and
reimbursement
regulations
proficient
in
the
use
of
computers
and
medical
software
programs
excellent
written
and
verbal
communication
skills
with
a
clear
understanding
of
medical
and
ethical
terminology
experience
in
providing
personalized
patient
care
and
follow up
dedication
to
upholding
the
highest
levels
of
professional
standards
and
ethical
practices
working
alone
or
working
in
groups
are
two
ways
of
tackling
tasks
given
in
various
situations
working
alone
has
several
advantages
one
gains
complete
independence
and
autonomy
in
a
task
can
complete
the
task
at
their
own
pace
and
can
avoid
being
rushed
or
swayed
by
the
group
however
working
alone
also
has
some
drawbacks
it
can
be
difficult
to
reach
an
understanding
of
the
task
at
hand
without
the
benefit
of
discussing
with
colleagues
the
focus
on
the
individual
can
also
lead
to
higher
levels
of
stress
and
feeling
overwhelmed
by
the
task
working
in
groups
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
with
more
heads
collaborating
the
collective
understanding
of
the
task
can
be
improved
ideas
can
be
exchanged
more
freely
without
one
individual
feeling
burdened
and
when
working
together
everyone
can
reach
the
finish
line
together
better
and
faster
however
there
are
drawbacks
to
working
in
groups
as
well
it
can
be
more
difficult
to
ensure
fairness
among
team
members
as
a
few
members
may
end
up
doing
more
of
the
work
than
others
additionally
without
proper
team
management
the
group
may
end
up
not
reaching
a
successful
conclusion
due
to
miscommunication
or
conflict
in
conclusion
each
approach
has
its
pros
and
cons
working
alone
gives
an
individual
more
autonomy
and
independence
but
can
also
be
more
isolating
and
come
with
a
greater
degree
of
pressure
working
in
groups
can
lead
to
collaborative
outcomes
but
can
also
be
more
challenging
to
manage
and
ensure
fairness
among
team
members
self improvement
is
an
important
and
necessary
part
of
life
it
can
be
hard
to
know
where
to
start
especially
when
it
comes
to
finding
the
best
approach
while
there
is
no
one size fits
all
answer
two
of
the
most
popular
methods
are
improvisation
and
following
a
script
when
trying
to
be
someone
these
two
methods
have
their
own
set
of
benefits
and
drawbacks
and
understanding
them
can
help
us
decide
which
is
best
for
our
own
individual
needs
improvising
when
trying
to
be
someone
is
a
great
way
to
achieve
goals
on
the
spot
it
can
help
you
think
on
your
feet
and
allow
you
to
be
more
creative
in
your
approach
and
better
adjust
to
unpredictable
situations
a
great
example
of
this
would
be
a
public
speaker
the
ability
to
think
quickly
and
remain
strategic
in
one
s
approach
can
be
helpful
in
persuading
an
audience
and
having
a
greater
impact
however
there
is
also
the
risk
that
if
we
do
not
know
our
subject
matter
well
enough
the
speech
can
go
off
the
rails
and
lead
to
results
that
are
less
than
ideal
on
the
other
hand
following
a
script
can
be
very
helpful
for
a
number
of
situations
when
someone
is
stuck
in
a
rut
or
trying
something
entirely
new
following
a
step by step
process
can
help
them
establish
a
foundation
and
develop
their
skills
over
time
this
can
be
especially
beneficial
in
contexts
such
as
business
or
entrepreneuring
as
if
the
individual
is
properly
prepared
this
can
allow
them
to
better
anticipate
obstacles
and
make
better
decisions
in
the
long
run
of
course
with
this
method
there
is
the
risk
of
becoming
overly
reliant
on
a
script
and
becoming
dependent
on
it
leading
to
a
lack
of
creative
thinking
in
conclusion
both
improvisation
and
following
a
script
can
be
valuable
and
helpful
tools
when
pursuing
self improvement
it
s
important
to
consider
the
context
and
end
goals
in
order
to
determine
which
method
best
fits
the
individual
as
well
as
how
effective
it
is
over
time
making
the
switch
from
a
five day
work
week
to
four
days
with
an
extended
school
day
could
be
a
benefit
for
conserving
energy
and
resources
however
this
change
could
create
a
host
of
problems
when
considering
the
needs
of
family
jobs
and
other
responsibilities
extended
school
days
can
create
difficulty
in
scheduling
daycare
for
young
children
drastically
cut
into
family
time
and
interfere
with
jobs
that
may
require
five day
work
weeks
when
considering
the
importance
of
family
time
and
connections
extended
school
days
could
have
many
detrimental
effects
it
could
restrict
the
amount
of
time
parents
are
able
to
spend
with
their
children
and
limit
the
opportunity
to
eat
meals
together
or
have
meaningful
conversations
this
could
also
mean
that
the
school
day
is
not
over
until
late
in
the
evening
after
sports
clubs
and
other
extracurricular
activities
limiting
the
amount
of
downtime
and
family
time
additionally
these
changes
could
interfere
with
the
ability
to
find
daycare
as
many
daycare
centers
close
before
a
ten hour
school
day
is
over
overall
while
there
are
potential
benefits
to
conserving
energy
and
resources
the
implications
of
an
extended
school
day
should
be
carefully
considered
when
considering
the
needs
of
families
jobs
and
other
responsibilities
as
i
plan
my
birthday
party
i
m
trying
to
decide
on
the
best
theme
i
ve
asked
friends
and
family
what
they
think
could
be
a
good
idea
and
i
m
considering
all
their
opinions
i
ve
also
done
some
research
into
different
color
combinations
for
a
birthday
party
to
help
give
my
party
more
of
a
cohesive
look
in
the
end
i
think
i
ll
choose
the
theme
that
can
work
for
a
variety
of
guests
and
that
everyone
can
enjoy
making
mistakes
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
but
they
don
t
always
have
to
be
the
end
of
the
world
in
fact
mistakes
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
both
in
sports
and
in
everyday
life
when
it
comes
to
sports
mistakes
can
be
an
invaluable
learning
tool
take
professional
sports
for
example
player
has
had
to
learn
from
costly
errors
made
in
their
past
before
they
could
become
a
pro
in
basketball
this
could
mean
failing
to
stick
with
a
defensive
assignment
in
baseball
it
could
mean
striking
out
in
a
clutch
situation
every
mistake
made
can
help
athletes
learn
what
works
and
what
does
not
gradually
improving
their
ability
to
succeed
the
same
is
true
in
everyday
life
someone
who
does
not
take
risks
and
make
mistakes
will
rarely
learn
and
grow
as
a
person
on
the
other
hand
someone
who
is
willing
to
make
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
will
become
stronger
and
more
successful
for
example
if
someone
wants
to
learn
how
to
cook
they
may
have
to
make
a
few
mistakes
before
they
perfect
their
dishes
or
if
someone
wants
to
get
better
at
public
speaking
they
may
have
to
make
mistakes
when
delivering
their
first
few
speeches
ultimately
making
mistakes
can
be
daunting
but
they
can
also
offer
surprising
benefits
rather
than
being
discouraged
by
mistakes
they
should
be
embraced
as
learning
tools
every
mistake
can
be
an
opportunity
to
improve
and
can
ultimately
help
a
person
succeed
in
life
the
subject
of
requiring
students
to
maintain
a
average
in
order
to
participate
in
sports
or
other
activities
has
caused
significant
debate
among
educators
students
and
other
stakeholders
in
one
camp
it
is
argued
that
requiring
students
to
maintain
a
certain
academic
standard
helps
to
reward
hard
work
in
the
classroom
and
also
encourages
them
to
take
their
studies
seriously
as
opposed
to
being
a
distraction
from
their
academic
pursuits
on
the
other
side
however
some
have
raised
the
point
that
this
policy
could
unfairly
limit
the
opportunities
of
some
students
who
may
excel
in
activities
such
as
sports
or
the
arts
but
lack
the
academic
skills
needed
to
maintain
a
average
my
position
is
that
requiring
a
average
to
participate
in
school
activities
is
an
unfair
policy
that
can
heavily
impact
students
who
are
struggling
with
their
school
work
and
put
a
financial
burden
on
families
who
already
struggle
to
afford
extracurricular
activities
a
policy
such
as
this
can
ultimately
have
the
opposite
intended
effect
as
it
may
serve
to
discourage
low income
students
and
other
minorities
from
participating
in
activities
due
to
the
additional
difficulty
in
meeting
the
required
average
furthermore
it
could
potentially
lead
to
alienation
among
students
who
are
unable
to
meet
the
academic
requirements
which
would
further
impact
their
engagement
in
school
activities
while
the
intention
of
requiring
a
average
is
to
ensure
students
have
a
strong
academic
foundation
the
potential
consequences
and
disadvantages
of
such
a
policy
suggest
that
it
is
not
an
effective
solution
for
achieving
this
goal
rather
it
is
important
to
provide
support
and
mentorship
for
struggling
students
to
ensure
they
receive
the
education
and
resources
they
need
to
succeed
mentoring
programs
that
pair
older
and
younger
students
come
with
many
benefits
firstly
older
students
can
use
their
knowledge
to
help
their
younger
colleagues
as
they
will
likely
have
more
experience
and
insights
to
share
for
example
an
older
student
may
be
able
to
provide
an
inside
view
of
a
college
or
offer
tips
on
applying
for
scholarships
in
addition
the
younger
students
can
act
as
mentors
of
their
own
in
terms
of
their
grasp
of
technology
familiarity
with
digital
media
and
the
latest
trends
in
youth
culture
finally
the
overall
collaboration
between
the
two
ages
can
bridge
the
gap
in
knowledge
and
experience
creating
an
open
and
symbiotic
atmosphere
of
learning
attending
classes
from
home
by
way
of
online
or
video
conferencing
has
been
of
great
benefit
to
students
parents
and
teachers
during
the
pandemic
for
students
online
learning
environments
provide
a
more
flexible
and
comfortable
learning
atmosphere
which
can
reduce
the
stress
of
commuting
to
school
parents
also
benefit
from
online
classes
by
having
more
time
to
participate
and
be
involved
in
their
child
s
education
teachers
on
the
other
hand
benefit
from
having
easier
access
to
students
in
different
parts
of
the
world
allowing
them
to
teach
at
a
larger
scale
a
successful
example
of
online
and
video
conferencing
classes
can
be
seen
in
the
south
korean
education
system
after
the
pandemic
caused
physical
classes
to
shut
down
last
year
online
and
video
conferencing
classes
were
quickly
implemented
and
were
very
successful
managed
to
not
only
transition
classes
to
the
digital
format
quickly
but
also
help
prevent
the
spread
of
the
virus
while
still
providing
students
with
quality
education
this
paved
the
way
for
other
countries
to
adopt
similar
measures
proving
that
online
or
video
conferencing
classes
can
be
very
successful
it
is
important
for
schools
to
have
a
clear
policy
regarding
cell
phones
and
other
gadgets
while
policy
and
are
two
different
school
cellphone
policies
is
the
better
choice
to
ensure
that
students
are
not
breaking
the
rules
of
their
school
policy
is
stricter
with
its
limitations
on
how
phones
and
gadgets
are
used
during
school
hours
such
as
preventing
the
phone
from
being
used
during
class
time
unless
specified
by
the
teacher
this
is
beneficial
as
it
allows
students
to
understand
the
expectations
of
phone
use
in
the
school
in
contrast
may
be
seen
as
more
lenient
in
its
approach
allowing
the
phone
to
be
used
more
freely
however
if
boundaries
are
not
outlined
students
may
not
have
a
full
understanding
of
the
limitations
of
phone
use
and
could
end
up
violating
the
policy
and
receiving
a
punishment
students
should
be
educated
on
their
responsibilities
when
using
their
phones
or
gadgets
at
school
regardless
of
the
policy
a
key
advantage
of
is
that
it
clearly
defines
boundaries
from
the
start
providing
students
with
the
information
they
need
to
make
sure
they
are
following
the
rules
policy
has
the
potential
to
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
be
aware
of
the
limits
thus
leaving
them
open
to
breaking
the
rules
in
conclusion
is
the
better
choice
for
students
to
ensure
that
they
are
not
breaking
the
rules
of
school
it
establishes
a
clear
set
of
expectations
and
students
are
able
to
understand
their
responsibilities
better
thus
reducing
the
possibility
of
violations
the
importance
of
knowing
your
limitations
when
using
phones
or
gadgets
in
school
can
not
be
overstated
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
for
influencing
others
is
providing
examples
that
will
help
illustrate
a
point
and
aid
in
convincing
them
of
an
argument
examples
can
demonstrate
to
people
why
an
idea
is
important
and
provide
them
with
a
tangible
solution
to
a
particular
problem
examples
can
also
serve
to
show
the
intended
impacts
of
an
action
and
help
to
foster
an
understanding
of
how
a
concept
can
work
in
the
real
world
for
example
if
we
are
trying
to
convince
people
about
the
value
of
investing
in
renewable
energy
sources
an
example
of
how
other
cities
have
made
the
switch
to
renewable
sources
and
seen
impressive
cost
savings
can
help
make
the
case
alternatively
if
we
are
trying
to
make
a
case
for
social
justice
reforms
presenting
examples
of
successful
reform
initiatives
in
other
countries
can
make
a
strong
argument
for
why
those
reforms
should
be
put
in
place
in
both
cases
providing
examples
can
lead
to
greater
understanding
of
an
issue
and
provide
individuals
with
evidence
of
how
things
can
be
improved
allowing
individuals
to
make
their
own
decisions
is
a
powerful
tool
for
teaching
responsibility
and
can
have
numerous
benefits
for
families
and
children
by
making
decisions
children
and
adolescents
can
learn
important
lessons
that
will
stay
with
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
decision making
can
increase
the
speed
of
accomplishment
since
decisions
can
be
made
quickly
and
efficiently
it
can
also
help
to
teach
children
the
importance
of
making
informed
decisions
and
the
consequences
of
their
actions
in
sum
decision making
skills
are
important
for
child
development
and
can
be
a
big
advantage
for
families
working
alone
and
working
in
groups
each
have
their
own
unique
advantages
and
disadvantages
working
in
groups
can
be
good
for
brainstorming
and
problem
solving
as
it
allows
a
team
to
come
up
with
more
solutions
and
ideas
through
collaboration
and
sharing
it
also
encourages
teamwork
skills
which
will
be
important
for
future
workplaces
however
it
can
also
be
a
challenge
as
a
team
must
be
able
to
trust
each
other
and
compromise
to
reach
an
agreement
additionally
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
conflicting
opinions
within
the
group
which
can
lead
to
group
conflict
and
wasted
time
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
offers
several
advantages
it
can
foster
individual
creativity
as
working
without
the
opinions
of
others
provides
the
opportunity
for
a
person
to
create
something
truly
unique
and
original
it
also
acts
as
a
great
stress
reliever
and
builds
up
mental
strength
as
it
gives
a
person
a
chance
to
focus
on
their
own
ideas
plan
their
own
projects
and
draw
inspiration
from
their
own
experiences
finally
working
alone
can
also
be
more
efficient
as
there
is
no
need
to
compromise
or
resolve
conflict
ultimately
working
alone
can
be
the
best
choice
for
students
it
provides
the
freedom
and
flexibility
to
explore
new
ideas
while
still
allowing
a
person
to
gain
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
in
the
future
working
alone
also
reduces
the
amount
of
stress
associated
with
group
dynamics
and
enhances
the
learning
experience
for
the
individual
excerpt
in
this
essay
we
will
explore
the
pros
and
cons
of
attending
a
regular
school
versus
distance
learning
on
one
hand
attending
a
regular
school
allows
students
to
be
immersed
in
a
traditional
school
environment
where
they
can
build
relationships
with
peers
access
valuable
resources
and
get
help
from
teachers
on
the
other
hand
distance
learning
offers
students
the
flexibility
to
create
their
own
schedule
the
ability
to
complete
coursework
without
having
to
leave
home
and
with
the
freedom
to
attend
from
anywhere
a
real life
example
of
how
beneficial
attending
a
regular
school
can
be
is
that
of
a
high
school
senior
living
in
rural
she
was
determined
to
make
the
most
of
her
school
experience
and
took
full
advantage
of
all
of
the
resources
her
school
had
to
offer
through
her
classes
clubs
and
activities
she
was
able
to
challenge
herself
academically
learn
valuable
information
about
college
meet
new
people
and
develop
her
strengths
and
passions
without
the
traditional
structure
of
a
regular
school
none
of
these
opportunities
would
have
been
available
to
at
a
regular
school
students
are
able
to
participate
in
a
wide
range
of
clubs
sports
and
activities
such
as
band
theater
robotics
and
more
these
encourage
students
to
build
social
skills
develop
their
talents
and
explore
different
interests
additionally
schools
often
have
access
to
additional
learning
resources
and
materials
such
as
libraries
computers
tutoring
programs
and
specialized
courses
that
are
not
available
to
students
enrolled
in
distance
learning
after
extensive
research
into
the
career
path
i
m
interested
in
including
how
much
people
can
make
and
what
the
job
entails
i
decided
to
ask
for
advice
from
my
parents
older
siblings
and
counselors
they
provided
me
with
valuable
advice
helping
me
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
potential
career
choice
to
gain
even
more
insight
i
visited
the
library
and
read
through
multiple
books
about
the
profession
and
spoke
to
experienced
individuals
who
have
already
pursued
the
same
career
i
asked
them
questions
regarding
their
job
wages
and
if
they
could
provide
any
tips
or
guidance
all
of
these
efforts
provided
me
with
the
necessary
information
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
the
career
i
want
to
pursue
phones
have
become
ubiquitous
in
our
digital
age
from
social
media
to
games
these
devices
have
revolutionized
the
way
we
communicate
and
interact
in
today
s
world
this
makes
the
contentious
question
of
whether
cell
phones
should
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
an
exceptionally
delicate
matter
on
one
hand
students
that
are
allowed
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
class
may
be
distracted
by
social
media
text
messages
and
other
digital
content
on
the
other
hand
if
used
properly
cell
phones
can
be
powerful
tools
that
can
be
used
in
the
classroom
to
help
students
learn
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
whether
or
not
students
should
be
allowed
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
class
it
is
important
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
one
of
the
primary
benefits
of
allowing
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
is
that
students
can
use
them
to
enhance
their
learning
experiences
for
example
students
can
use
their
phones
to
research
topics
watch
educational
videos
and
take
notes
in
addition
some
students
may
have
audio
or
visual
impairments
that
can
be
aided
by
technology
however
there
are
drawbacks
to
allowing
cell
phone
use
in
class
as
mentioned
cell
phones
can
be
extremely
distracting
for
some
students
even
with
appropriate
warnings
one
student
on
their
phone
could
quickly
turn
into
a
whole
class
of
students
with
their
eyes
glued
to
their
screens
in
addition
allowing
cell
phone
use
could
open
up
a
potential
safety
risk
the
classroom
is
meant
to
be
a
learning
environment
not
one
for
inappropriate
content
or
malicious
actors
despite
these
drawbacks
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
in
class
can
still
be
beneficial
teachers
and
students
alike
should
be
aware
of
the
potential
consequences
that
could
arise
from
allowing
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
and
be
proactive
in
creating
rules
and
procedures
to
prevent
these
issues
from
occurring
with
a
proper
understanding
of
the
risks
and
rewards
associated
with
allowing
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
teachers
and
administrators
can
make
a
decision
that
is
best
suited
to
the
learning
environment
of
their
students
having
an
effective
strategy
before
working
hard
is
an
important
step
to
ensure
success
without
planning
important
aspects
of
the
work
or
project
may
be
forgotten
leading
to
potential
failure
taking
the
time
to
consider
plans
perspectives
and
different
opinions
can
help
identify
different
solutions
and
options
to
achieve
success
working
hard
without
considering
these
important
steps
is
unlikely
to
be
as
effective
due
to
missing
crucial
information
or
approaches
additionally
having
the
discipline
to
never
give
up
without
considering
the
whole
picture
could
often
mean
wasted
energy
and
time
it
is
far
more
effective
to
establish
an
effective
strategy
before
working
hard
rather
than
to
blindly
push
forward
and
never
consider
the
crucial
factors
of
success
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
the
most
important
skill
anyone
can
learn
in
order
to
have
success
in
life
it
can
be
the
difference
between
achieving
your
goals
and
struggling
to
make
any
progress
the
good
news
is
it
is
possible
to
train

taking
online
or
watching
video
conferencing
classes
has
a
number
of
pros
and
cons
that
must
be
considered
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
of
online
and
video
conferencing
classes
is
convenience
students
can
access
and
participate
from
anywhere
anytime
on
their
own
schedule
additionally
with
video
conferencing
students
can
better
understand
facial
expressions
and
body
language
that
they
might
miss
in
an
online
course
a
potential
downside
to
both
online
and
video

classes
is
the
lack
of
student
engagement
it
can
be
harder
to
stay
focused
and
engaged
in
an
online
or
video
conferencing
environment
due
to
a
lack
of
physical
presence
and
interaction
with
peers
and
instructors
another
potential
disadvantage
is
difficulty
understanding
complex
topics
in
video
conferencing
the
instructor
might
not
be
able
to
physically
demonstrate
something
which
can
make
it
harder
to
understand
the
topic
in
conclusion
online
and
video
conferencing
classes
offer
a
unique
set
of
benefits
and
drawbacks
ultimately
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
should
be
weighed
carefully
in
order
to
choose
the
best
learning
method
for
an
individual
student
the
story
of
the
tortoise
and
the
rabbit
is
a
timeless
lesson
of
the
power
of
hard
work
determination
and
taking
action
the
tale
gives
us
a
powerful
perspective
on
the
importance
of
taking
steady
action
to
achieve
our
goals
in
the
story
the
tortoise
was
determined
to
win
the
race
and
took
consistent
and
steady
action
toward
that
goal
and
the
rabbit
was
distracted
and
ultimately
stopped
moving
thus
allowing
the
tortoise
to
win
this
story
can
be
applied
to
two
contrasting
students
taking
summer
vacation
the
first
student
starts
work
on
a
task
from
the
beginning
of
the
vacation
while
the
other
student
relaxes
and
does
not
take
action
until
the
end
the
student
who
takes
action
will
have
greater
success
in
completing
the
task
than
the
student
who
does
not
take
action
taking
consistent
and
steady
action
will
give
them
the
resilience
required
to
navigate
potential
challenges
pitfalls
and
moments
of
doubt
ultimately
the
lesson
of
the
tortoise
and
the
rabbit
gives
us
insight
into
the
importance
of
time
and
how
we
can
make
it
effective
by
doing
something
taking
consistent
action
prevents
failure
and
allows
us
to
make
progress
towards
our
goals
we
can
all
benefit
from
this
story
by
reminding
ourselves
to
take
action
and
stay
determined
in
order
to
succeed
in
anything
we
set
out
to
do
taking
the
traditional
four
years
to
complete
high
school
can
offer
students
a
variety
of
benefits
completing
extra
time
in
high
school
allows
students
to
gain
valuable
academic
knowledge
that
will
help
them
be
successful
during
college
furthermore
the
extra
time
helps
prepare
students
for
the
future
by
giving
them
additional
time
to
take
college
preparatory
classes
as
well
as
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
and
internships
in
addition
to
the
academic
benefits
of
completing
the
standard
four
years
of
high
school
students
also
gain
the
advantage
of
more
time
to
rest
and
relax
during
the
summer
without
the
rush
to
complete
high
school
earlier
students
are
able
to
take
a
break
and
rest
between
the
hectic
school
year
allowing
them
to
take
advantage
of
leisurely
summer
activities
while
still
having
ample
time
to
study
and
prepare
for
college
when
necessary
of
course
there
are
also
some
disadvantages
of
taking
the
traditional
four
years
in
high
school
spending
more
time
in
high
school
can
be
seen
as
a
delay
in
students
starting
their
college
and
career
ambitions
this
can
lead
to
feeling
behind
as
compared
to
peers
who
are
farther
along
in
their
field
of
study
or
career
additionally
if
a
student
is
eager
to
move
away
for
college
it
can
be
difficult
to
wait
an
extra
year
or
two
before
finally
packing
their
bags
though
there
may
be
a
few
disadvantages
of
completing
the
standard
four
years
in
high
school
there
are
numerous
benefits
that
can
help
students
succeed
in
their

the
advantages
of
making
your

when

can
ensure
a

at
times

take
advice
from
external
sources
such
as
professional
advisors
to
help
them
make
decisions
on
important
matters
however
this
may
not
always
be
in
a
person
s
best
interest
as
the
potential
exists
for
them
to
be
given
bad
financial
advice
in
these
cases
they
need
to
make
sure
that
they
are
making
an
independent
decision
which
is
free
from

confidence
and
boost

and
serve
as
inspiration
for
pursuing
our
ambitions
good
traits
are
an
essential
component
of
a
happy
and
fulfilled
life
after
hours
of
researching
pet
daycares
i
learned
about
the
level
of
care
they
provide
to
our
beloved
animals
including
not
only
food
and
water
but
also
plenty
of
physical
and
mental
stimulation
in
forms
of
indoor
activities
and
access
to
outdoor
space
animals
such
as
fish
require
a
certain
balance
of
water
temperature
ph
and
salinity
among
other
variables
to
remain
healthy
which
must
be
taken
into
account
when
creating
a
home
for
them
the
living
conditions
for
plants
depend
on
a
number
of
variables
including
temperature
levels
of
soil
moisture
and
nutrients
and
light
intensity
learning
how
to
regulate
the
temperature
for
plants
is
essential
for
their
growth
and
development
lastly
for
individuals
interested
in
becoming
a
swimming
teacher
or
lifeguard
i
learned
that
other
certifications
and
qualifications
may
be
required
including
first
aid
and
certification
lifesaving
abilities
and
aquatic
instructor
certification
schools
should
not
be
year round
for
many
reasons
the
foremost
of
which
has
to
do
with
the
importance
of
summertime
for
students
is
a
time
for
students
to
de stress
and
take
a
break
from
the
rigor
of
regular
school
life
it
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
learn
and
explore
outside
of
the
classroom
in
ways
traditional
schooling
can
not
moreover
research
shows
that
longer
hours
of
schooling
actually
decrease
education
quality
when
students
are
in
school
for
too
long
the
quality
and
quantity
of
learning
decreases
by
taking
regular
summer
breaks
students
are
able
to
come
into
the
new
school
year
fresher
and
more
motivated
breaks
also
allow
students
to
spend
more
time
with
their
family
and
friends
which
can
be
especially
beneficial
for
teenage
development
finally
longer
school
years
are
expensive
and
can
put
incredible
strain
on
school
systems
year round
schools
require
additional
funds
for
staffing
utilities
and
resources
it
can
often
be
too
costly
for
schools
with
already
strained
budgets
in
contrast
summertime
can
be
a
much needed
break
for
the
school
system
and
for
administrators
in
summary
summertime
is
a
vital
part
of
the
school
year
for
students
and
schools
should
not
be
year round
summer
offers
students
a
chance
to
rest
and
explore
the
quality
of
their
learning
is
improved
and
it
can
be
more
cost effective
for
school
systems
traits
like
resilience
kindness
and
ambition
have
a
strong
influence
on
our
behavior
outlook
on
life
and
overall
wellbeing
through
research
studies
it
has
been
discovered
that
character
traits
are
heavily
influenced
by
external
factors
such
as
family
friends
and
media
during
childhood
for
instance
parents
play
a
key
role
in
developing
a
child
s
character
they
can
set
a
good
example
teach
the
importance
of
good
values
and
foster
respect
and
self discipline
in
their
children
similarly
the
influence
of
friends
can
impact
the
development
of
character
it
s
essential
that
children
learn
from
peers
who
demonstrate
good
character
and
positive
behavior
moreover
with
the
rise
of
technology
media
has
become
increasingly
influential
on
young
minds
creating
both
positive
and
negative
impressions
about
certain
character
traits
therefore
it
is
important
that
we
learn
effective
methods
for
cultivating
character
traits
in
young
people
establishing
open
and
honest
communication
with
children
is
one
effective
measure
as
it
allows
children
to
express
their
feelings
honestly
and
to
better
connect
with
their
caretakers
setting
clear
ground
rules
for
appropriate
behavior
demonstrating
respect
and
modeling
strong
personal
character
in
front
of
children
are
also
effective
methods
for
fostering
positive
character
traits
ultimately
it
is
essential
that
we
help
our
youth
understand
and
internalize
the
importance
of
developing
good
character
traits
one
of
the
principal
ideas
that
embraced
was
the
belief
that
hard
work
and
the
unwillingness
to
give
up
on
success
was
the
key
to
life
satisfaction
even
argued
that
hard
work
was
essential
to
all
areas
of
life
from
finding
financial
success
to
gaining
personal
fulfillment
while
this
idea
of
hard
work
can
have
its
benefits
there
are
a
few
drawbacks
as
well
on
the
positive
side
embracing
a
hardworking
mindset
will
often
lead
to
greater
success
since
it
fosters
a
sense
of
perseverance
and
ambition
individuals
who
maintain
a
hardworking
attitude
often
have
a
more
positive
outlook
on
life
since
they
recognize
that
all
their
efforts
are
being
put
towards
something
constructive
moreover
continuously
striving
for
success
can
build
a
strong
sense
of
satisfaction
since
even
small
victories
bring
hope
for
an
improved
future
however
while
hard
work
has
several
benefits
it
can
also
cause
stress
and
distraction
for
instance
an
extensive
focus
on
success
can
lead
to
a
narrow
perspective
leaving
individuals
feeling
exhausted
overwhelmed
or
frustrated
additionally
hard
work
can
sometimes
become
too
consuming
leading
to
a
decreased
sense
of
enjoyment
and
meaning
in
life
ultimately
while
s
idea
of
hard
work
can
provide
plentiful
beneficial
outcomes
it
is
important
to
remember
that
a
balanced
life
is
still
essential
in
order
to
maintain
overall
health
and
well being
one
advantage
of
student designed
projects
for
summer
assignments
is
that
students
can
use
their
creativity
to
develop
an
individualized
project
which
will
likely
be
more
engaging
this
allows
them
to
explore
their
interests
while
receiving
academic
credit
additionally
student designed
projects
allow
students
to
take
ownership
of
their
learning
which
can
be
empowering
and
give
an
increase
in
their
self confidence
on
the
other
hand
teacher designed
projects
can
provide
structure
and
focus
and
help
students
stay
motivated
furthermore
the
teacher
is
looking
out
for
the
class
as
a
whole
in
deciding
the
focus
of
the
project
thus
potentially
providing
a
better
framework
for
success
however
with
teacher designed
projects
individuality
may
be
sacrificed
as
the
projects
are
often
assigned
to
a
group
of
students
as
one
whole
self reliance
has
become
an
increasingly
important
concept
today
for
individuals
businesses
and
communities
it
is
the
act
of
becoming
independent
taking
responsibility
for
one
s
own
decisions
and
relying
on
oneself
as
opposed
to
seeking
advice
or
guidance
the
military
mindset
the
idea
of
being
self reliant
in
order
to
achieve
a
common
goal
is
closely
related
to
this
concept
self reliance
is
extremely
relevant
in
current
events
especially
in
terms
of
government
shutdowns
it
calls
for
a
shift
in
decision making
from
seeking
external
guidance
to
using
self reliance
and
autonomy
self reliance
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
society
leading
to
increased
innovation
and
productivity
to
effectively
implement
it
individuals
must
learn
to
take
personal
responsibility
for
their
own
actions
and
develop
self confidence
and
discipline
additionally
acknowledging
failure
and
learning
from
mistakes
is
an
important
part
of
this
concept
by
promoting
self reliance
individuals
can
prioritize
their
own
strengths
and
be
empowered
to
make
their
own
decisions
and
take
ownership
of
their
lives
it
is
vitally
important
that
students
maintain
a
average
or
higher
in
order
to
participate
in
sports
and
other
activities
such
academic
requirements
can
benefit
students
parents
and
schools
in
several
ways
and
foremost
it
encourages
students
to
prioritize
their
schoolwork
and
puts
academic
performance
as
a
top
priority
it
also
cultivates
good
learning
habits
and
time
management
skills
better
preparing
students
for
future
academic
endeavors
furthermore
having
such
standards
in
place
will
allow
parents
to
know
that
their
children
are
being
held
to
a
higher
standard
when
it
comes
to
their
school
performance
as
well
as
giving
them
peace
of
mind
that
the
activities
their
children
take
part
in
will
still
be
held
to
that
same
standard
finally
schools
can
make
sure
that
their
educational
institutions
are
held
in
high
regard
and
that
their
students
have
sufficient
academic
qualifications
that
they
are
taking
the
appropriate
steps
towards
reaching
their
desired
outcome
in
conclusion
having
a
minimum
average
to
be
eligible
for
sports
and
other
activities
is
essential
to
ensure
that
students
are
taking
academics
seriously
that
parents
are
being
provided
with
the
peace
of
mind
that
their
children
are
being
held
accountable
and
that
the
school
is
held
in
high
regard
outdoor
activities
offer
a
wealth
of
possibilities
for
fun
fitness
and
exploration
from
hiking
swimming
and
camping
to
rock
climbing
sky
diving
and
hunting
the
opportunities
for
excitement
and
thrill
are
boundless
spending
time
in
nature
has
countless
physical
psychological
and
spiritual
benefits
going
outside
allows
us
to
break
away
from
technology
and
connect
with
our
environment
beyond
the
physical
exercise
there
is
a
sense
of
adventure
and
exploration
when
one
embarks
on
an
outdoor
activity
compared
to
playing
video
games
indoors
outdoor
activities
allow
us
to
engage
with
our
environment
this
increases
the
challenge
and
can
bring
out
the
best
of
our
minds
and
bodies
that
being
said
there
are
some
risks
and

better
human

in
the
long
run
everyone
at
some
point
has
made
an

that
had
a
lasting
effect
although
it
can
be
stressful
and
uncomfortable
to
make
a
mistake
it
can
help
a
person
grow
in
many
ways
mistakes
often
push
people
out
of
their
comfort
zones
and
encourage
them
to
try
something
new
this
can
open
up
new
doors
of

important
benefit
of

they
help
people
to
become
more
resilient
when
a
person
makes
an
error
they
may
be
embarrassed
or
discouraged
at
first
but
they
eventually
pick
themselves
up
and
learn
from
what
went
wrong
this
can
give
them
the
strength
they
need
to
overcome
any
obstacles
in
their
lives
i
can
personally
attest
to
how
my
mistakes
have
helped
me
become
a
better
person
last
year
i
was
involved
in
a
difficult
situation
with
a
close
friend
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
way
i
handled
it
and
felt
guilty
about
it
for
some
time
the
experience
made
me
realize
how
my
words
and
actions
can
affect
others
so
i
made
sure
that
in
the
future
i
was
more
considerate
and
aware
of
the
needs
of
others
in
conclusion
mistakes
can
be
difficult
to
experience
but
they
can
bring
out
the
best
in
people
and
help
them
become
better
human
beings
with
a
willingness
to
learn
and
grow
mistakes
can
be
used
not
only
to
gain
insight
but
also
to
build
resilience
and
personal
growth
the
work
ethics
of
some
of
the
world
s
greatest
athletes
have
a
direct
effect
on
their
success
and
have
exemplified
how
hard
work
plays
a
significant
role
in
reaching
success
each
of
these
basketball
players
have
made
history
through
their
hard
work
and
drive
from
s
intense
competitiveness
and
understanding
of
the
game
to
s
relentless
practice
routines
and
will
to
win
any
way
he
could
to
s
focused
mentality
and
ability
to
push
himself
and
s
relentless
work
ethic
and
drive
comparatively
someone
who
is
idle
or
expects
things
to
come
to
them
is
likely
not
to
reach
the
same
level
of
success
as
those
who
put
in
the
effort
working
hard
requires
concentration
dedication
and
a
willingness
to
put
yourself
in
uncomfortable
situations
to
reach
your
goals
when
one
puts
in
the
hard
work
they
can
expect
to
be
rewarded
with
tangible
results
correlating
to
their
efforts
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
work
ethics
of
these
athletes
are
not
only
applicable
to
sports
but
also
to
life
as
a
whole
when
one
works
hard
they
can
almost
always
expect
to
be
rewarded
the
proposed
policy
to
require
a
minimum
grade
of
to
join
school
sports
teams
could
have
a
number
of
positive
effects
improved
grades
can
result
from
an
enhanced
sense
of
motivation
in
students
to
strive
to
reach
the
threshold
and
also
from
the
development
of
a
stronger
work
ethic
required
to
balance
sport
and
school
activities
and
fitness
could
also
be
improved
from
increased
physical
activity
and
reducing
the
risk
of
health
problems
furthermore
the
ability
to
demonstrate
college level
commitment
and
hard work
through
showing
sports
performance
as
well
as
improved
grades
may
help
with
college
acceptance
on
the
flip
side
this
policy
could
discourage
some
students
from
taking
part
in
school
athletics
those
who
do
not
meet
the
minimum
grade
may
become
disillusioned
with
study
due
to
their
exclusion
from
the
sports
team
which
could
consequently
have
a
negative
impact
on
their
academic
performance
and
grades
additionally
those
with
financial
limitations
may
be
unable
to
afford
extra
tuition
to
catch
up
on
their
studies
in
order
to
meet
the
grade
requirement
adding
one
and
a
half
extra
hours
to
the
school
day
for
students
could
have
a
vast
range
of
consequences
both
positive
and
negative
on
the
positive
side
students
may
have
more
opportunities
to
engage
with
their
coursework
in depth
and
get
more
out
of
their
educational
experience
it
could
also
give
them
more
time
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
and
develop
new
skills
on
the
negative
side
it
could
increase
the
amount
of
stress
students
face
and
lead
to
higher
levels
of
fatigue
and
burnout
it
could
also
discourage
them
from
joining
extracurricular
activities
by
reducing
the
amount
of
time
they
have
available
to
participate
furthermore
it
may
create
additional
financial
burdens
as
students
would
need
to
pay
for
childcare
for
any
siblings
they
may
have
ultimately
the
potential
consequences
of
adding
one
and
a
half
extra
hours
to
the
school
day
for
students
are
far reaching
and
should
be
carefully
considered
high
school
students
often
look
forward
to
summer
vacation
as
a
time
to
take
a
break
from
their
heavy
workloads
and
enjoy
some
well deserved
rest
and
relaxation
the
length
of
summer
vacation
for
high
school
students
has
been
debated
for
some
time
proponents
of
a
longer
summer
break
argue
that
students
need
the
additional
time
to
rest
and
recuperate
from
the
demands
of
the
academic
year
on
the
other
hand
proponents
of
a
shorter
summer
break
argue
that
students
need
more
time
in
the
classroom
to
keep
up
their
educational
progress
weighing
both
sides
of
the
debate
there
is
a
strong
argument
to
be
made
for
changing
the
length
of
summer
vacation
for
high
school
students
a
shorter
summer
break
would
give
students
the
opportunity
to
learn
more
in
the
classroom
and
avoid
the
learning
gap
that
often
takes
place
over
long
school
holidays
longer
summer
break
however
would
give
students
more
time
to
relax
and
relieve
any
stress
from
the
year
longer
summer
holidays
could
also
give
students
the
opportunity
to
do
more
exploring
such
as
taking
abroad
trips
to
enrich
their
knowledge
and
learn
more
about
the
world
ultimately
it
is
important
to
consider
how
changing
the
length
of
summer
vacation
for
high
school
students
could
benefit
them
and
their
educational
progress
with
a
shorter
summer
break
students
could
build
on
their
academic
knowledge
and
fill
in
any
potential
gaps
they
might
have
on
the
other
hand
with
a
longer
summer
break
students
could
relax
and
take
the
time
to
explore
their
interests
with
the
added
benefit
of
refreshing
their
minds
and
bodies
for
the
upcoming
school
year

students
should
absolutely
be
encouraged
to
participate
in
community

provides
an
opportunity
for
them
to
learn
important
life
skills
while
giving
back
to
the
communities
in
which
they
live
in
addition
to
the
personal
benefits
such
as
the
development
of
problem
solving
teamwork
and
communication
skills
community
service
can
also
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
community
s
overall
quality
of
life
examples
of
activities
students
could
do
to
benefit
their
community
could
include
spending
an
afternoon
at
a
local
animal
shelter
playing
with
the
animals
volunteering
at
a
soup
kitchen
helping
to
clean
up
a
local
park
running
a
literacy
program
or
collecting
food
for
a
food
bank
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
many
different
activities
students
could
choose
to
do
to
make
a
difference
in
their
community
online
classes
and
video
conferencing
offer
a
number
of
benefits
to
students
that
are
otherwise
unable
to
get
to
school
for
those
who
lack
transportation
taking
classes
from
home
can
be
a
great
way
to
continue
learning
and
stay
caught
up
with
their
peers
for
teens
who
are
victims
of
bullying
avoiding
such
situations
altogether
while
taking
classes
online
provides
a
safe
learning
environment
where
they
can
focus
on
their
studies

was
a
prominent
figure
of
the
american
of
the
century
and
is
widely
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
influential
writers
of
the
era
wrote
extensively
about
individualism
and
self reliance
encouraging
people
to
stay
true
to
themselves
and
to
take
responsibility
for
their
emotions
actions
and
choices
believed
being
yourself
was
one
of
the
most
important
steps
to
achieve
true
spiritual
self sufficiency

encouraged
readers
to
remain
true
to
themselves
despite
the
external
pressures
and
judgments
from
society
or
other
people
according
to
one
can
only
benefit
from
staying
true
to
themselves
and
should
not
be
swayed
by
the
opinions
of
others
on
the
other
hand
some
people
may
think
that
it
is
not
advantageous
to
be
an
individual
self
they
may
argue
that
conforming
to
the
norms
of
society
is
necessary
for
success
and
that
individualism
can
be
detrimental
to
one
s
career
and
social
life
however
argued
that
staying
true
to
your
own
convictions
and
your
authentic
self
is
the
key
to
happiness
in
conclusion
it
is
best
to
be
yourself
rather
than
be
someone
you
are
not
staying
true
to
yourself
and
embracing
individualism
can
help
you
make
meaningful
connections
build
strong
relationships
and
find
greater
satisfaction
and
success
argues
that
these
personal
benefits
are
more
important
than
the
short term
gains
that
come
from
following
the
expectations
of
society
graduating
from
high
school
one
year
early

several
advantages
for
example

may
also
give
students
an
extra
year
to
decide
on
a
career
and
college
that
is
best
fit
for
them

success
rates
they
are
more
likely
to
be
accepted
into
colleges
and
universities

rate
of

students
who
plan

guides
to
online
classes
students
can
find
the
resources
that

and
ultimately
achieving
personal
fulfillment
when
we
show
positive
qualities
such
as
kindness
empathy
and
respect
through
our
behavior
and
actions
we
can
have
a
powerful
influence
on
the
people
around
us
by
modeling
these
qualities
ourselves
we
give
others
permission
to
do
the
same
for
example
i
remember
growing
up
with
my
siblings
if
i
showed
them
respect
our
interactions
were
much
calmer
and
more
constructive
this
taught
them
to
show
respect
to
others
and
resulted
in
healthier
relationships
with
our
peers
another
example
is
volunteering
in
my
local
community
through
my
actions
i
am
demonstrating
how

it
is
to
help
others

home
also
eliminates
the
need
to
travel
to
and
from
school
which
can
save
time
and
money
however
there
are
downsides
to
learning
at

a
harder
time

of
ideas
between
classmates
and
provides
an
opportunity
for
them
to
collaborate
and
combine
resources
work
also
helps
to
foster
and
develop
students
social
and
communication
skills
in
order
for
students
to
get
the
most
out
of
group
work
teachers
should
actively
facilitate
the
process
they
can
do
this
by
establishing
clear
expectations
for
the
project
providing
supportive
guidance
to
help
keep
the
group
on
task
and
outlining
roles
and
responsibilities
teachers
should
also
be
sure
to
assign
tasks
to
individuals
within
the
group
as
this
helps
provide
accountability
there
are
three
key
reasons
why
teachers
should
encourage
students
to
work
together
it
allows
students
to
develop
vital
collaboration
and
conflict
resolution
skills
which
will
benefit
them
when
they
enter
the
workplace
it
can
lead
to
an
increase
in
creative
thinking
and
problem solving
abilities
as
class
members
work
together
to
tackle
complex
tasks
finally
group
work
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
share
their
knowledge
and
learn
from
one
another
activities
that
are
best
suited
for
group
work
include
ones
that
require
problem solving
research
debate
or
peer support
for
example
class
members
could
work
together
to
design
a
marketing
campaign
for
a
new
product
present
their
perspectives
on
a
case
study
or
choose
a
topic
for
a
group
research
paper
overall
working
in
a
group
has
the
potential
to
be
very
beneficial
for
students
by
providing
students
with
the
opportunity
to
work
together
teachers
can
help
cultivate
important
skills
that
can
be
applied
to
the
classroom
and
beyond
as
such
it
is
important
that
teachers
create
a
supportive
environment
for
group
work
to
thrive
graduating
high
school
in
four
years
rather
than
three
is
often
the
better
choice
for
students
in
search
of
a
fulfilling
educational
program
not
only
does
the
fourth
year
offer
more
opportunities
to
take
interesting
classes
and
extracurricular
activities
but
it
also
provides
added
protection
against
academic
struggles
such
as
poor
grades
or
a
lack
of
credits
for
starters
the
fourth
year
of
high
school
provides
additional
time
for
students
to
enhance
their
education
electives
and
extra
study
courses
can
be
taken
allowing
students
to
further
specialize
in
their
areas
of
interest
extracurricular
groups
such
as
student
government
or
volunteer
organizations
provide
the
opportunity
to
work
together
with
like minded
peers
these
activities
offer
a
highly
enriching
learning
experience
and
give
students
the
tools
they
need
to
achieve
their
aspirations
moreover
graduating
high
school
in
four
years
also
protects
against
the
consequences
of
a
difficult
academic
path
missing
credits
or
a
low
can
carry
serious
repercussions
when
it
comes
time
to
apply
to
college
with
the
buffer
of
a
fourth
year
these
issues
can
be
addressed
in
a
manageable
and
stress free
way
by
adding
an
extra
year
of
high
school
a
student
can
adjust
their
studies
to
ensure
a
successful
transition
in
conclusion
for
those
looking
to
make
the
most
of
their
high
school
experience
four
years
is
often
the
right
choice
with
the
flexibility
of
additional
courses
and
the
security
of
academic
protection
graduating
high
school
in
four
years
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
reach
their
full
potential
and
transition
seamlessly
into
the
next
stage
of
their
life
it
is
clear
that
older
students
can
be
a
huge
asset
to
younger
students
when
it
comes
to
school
work
an
older
student
s
greater
knowledge
and
understanding
of
concepts
can
help
younger
students
fill
in
gaps
or
better
understand
certain
topics
furthermore
the
two
age
groups
can
learn
team
work
together
as
the
older
student
guides
the
younger
the
younger
will
be
learning
how
to
be
a
leader
while
the
older
student
sharpens
their
own
problem solving
skills
additionally
the
older
student
may
offer
great
advice
that
is
tailored
exactly
to
the
younger
student
s
needs
it
is
also
invaluable
for
younger
students
to
be
able
to
glean
wisdom
from
someone
who
has
already
faced
similar
challenges
it
is
helpful
for
schools
to
create
programs
that
pair
up
older
and
younger
students
as
these
programs
create
mutual
benefits
for
the
students
the
interactions
between
the
students
of
different
ages
foster
relationships
that
would
not
have
otherwise
been
made
and
the
different
points
of
view
in
these
relationships
often
lead
to
unique
perspectives
that
contribute
to
educational
growth
for
everyone
involved
taking
online
classes
during
high
school
can
provide
a
number
of
benefits
for
students
they
can
have
the
flexibility
of
taking
classes
outside
of
the
traditional
school
setting
allowing
for
more
control
over
their
studies
since
traditional
classes
involve
in person
attendance
it
can
be
difficult
to
balance
school
and
other
obligations
online
classes
make
it
much
easier
for
students
to
complete
their
coursework
on
their
own
time
additionally
online
classes
can
be
beneficial
for
students
that
have
to
work
or
balance
other
commitments
outside
of
school
classes
also
provide
opportunities
for
students
to
gain
knowledge
and
skills
in
certain
areas
outside
of
what
s
taught
in
their
high
school
curriculum
this
can
help
to
prepare
them
for
college
or
a
career
path
all
of
these
factors
help
to
make
online
classes
an
attractive
option
for
high
school
students
as
they
can
allow
them
to
graduate
earlier
and
pursue
further
education
or
career
paths
no
matter
how
hard
life
may
become
or
how
much
it
seems
like
you
have
been
mastered
in
something
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
s
important
to
never
give
up
the
people
that
do
give
up
end
up
regretting
it
while
those
who
keep
persevering
can
achieve
the
success
they
always
wanted
take
the
example
of
star
for
example
before
his
stardom
felt
like
he
had
been
defeated
by
the
world
his
attempts
at
pursuing
a
higher
education
were
thwarted
and
he
felt
he
had
nowhere
to
go
with
his
life
but
refused
to
give
up
instead
he
pooled
his
resources
to
start
his
own
channel
and
went
to
work
through
hard
work
dedication
and
a
commitment
to
staying
true
to
himself
he
has
since
become
the
most
subscribed
channel
in
the
world
amassing
million
subscribers
another
example
of
why
people
should
not
give
up
even
when
they
feel
they
can
t
go
on
lies
in
the
inspiring
story
of
before
achieving
fame
was
living
in
poverty
he
could
be
found
sleeping
in
his
van
or
sending
messages
to
casting
agents
at
night
he
didn
t
allow
his
older
circumstance
to
dictate
his
own
future
in
the
end
became
one
of
the
most
successful
and
acclaimed
actors
of
all
time
these
inspiring
stories
show
that
no
matter
how
dire
a
situation
may
seem
it
is
important
to
never
give
up
people
who
have
the
courage
to
keep
going
no
matter
what
are
always
able
to
reach
great
successes
that
they
couldn
t
have
imagined
reaching
before
so
keep
pushing
through
and
tackling
life
head
on
you
never
know
what
amazing
opportunities
and
successes
might
be
waiting
for
you
in
the
future
the
increase
of
the
school
day
by
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
a
student
s
day
would
have
the
potential
to
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the
physical
mental
and
emotional
well being
of
students
teachers
and
bus
drivers
to
start
with
physical
health
with
more
time
at
school
every
day
students
would
be
more
prone
to
fatigue
leading
to
an
overall
decrease
in
physical
activity
for
teachers
and
bus
drivers
the
strain
on
them
for
the
increase
in
time
and
effort
they
would
need
to
expend
working
would
become
more
and
more
taxing
in
terms
of
mental
health
and
happiness
the
students
would
be
more
under
pressure
to
cope
with
more
time
in
the
classroom
this
could
lead
to
higher
levels
of
stress
and
anxiety
as
students
would
have
to
manage
even
tighter
schedules
for
teachers
the
same
can
be
said
as
they
would
find
themselves
with
greater
workloads
and
more
homework
to
check
drivers
too
would
find
it
more
difficult
to
meet
the
extra
demands
of
their
job
finally
the
after school
program
could
also
be
affected
heavily
by
the
extra
hour
and
a
half
school
day
there
would
likely
need
to
be
either
cutbacks
in
the
program
or
changes
on
how
the
program
is
conducted
this
could
lead
to
a
decrease
in
morale
and
enthusiasm
among
students
leading
to
an
overall
decrease
in
quality
of
programs
in
conclusion
the
addition
of
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
could
have
the
potential
to
adversely
affect
the
physical
mental
and
emotional
health
of
students
teachers
and
bus
drivers
additionally
the
after school
program
could
become
more
difficult
to
maintain
and
lead
to
decreased
motivation
for
those
involved
i
disagree
with
the
proposed
policy
change
that
students
must
have
at
least
a
b
average
in
order
to
participate
in
sports
or
other
activities
although
academic
excellence
should
be
encouraged
this
policy
could
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
school
community
as
it
would
unfairly
restrict
students
from
participating
in
activities
that
foster
team
building
and
social
engagement
the
policy
could
also
negatively
impact
students
with
lower
academic
achievements
or
those
who
struggle
with
learning
disabilities
who
may
find
it
too
difficult
to
meet
the
required
grade
average
instead
of
a
strict
average
requirement
i
believe
schools
should
focus
on
helping
their
students
excel
in
academics
while
emphasizing
the
importance
of
extracurricular
activities
which
can
often
help
students
emotionally
and
socially
as
a
high
school
student
planning
for
my
future
career
i
have
been
researching
courses
related
to
the
profession
that
i
am
interested
in
pursuing
through
my
research
i
have
been
able
to
understand
the
experience
necessary
to
be
successful
in
that
field
and
the
commitment
that
i
will
need
to
make
in
order
to
achieve
my
goals
one
of
the
advantages
of
focusing
on
a
particular
profession
in
high
school
is
that
i
can
start
my
journey
towards
achieving
my
goals
while
in
school
and
begin
preparing
for
college
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
some
drawbacks
of
specializing
in
one
field
as
it
may
limit
my
options
later
on
therefore
it
is
important
for
me
to
research
and
evaluate
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
different
paths
i
can
take
in
order
to
become
successful
and
also
be
aware
of
the
impact
that
my
choices
in
high
school
may
have
on
my
future
career
opportunities
part
attaining
an
education
is
paramount
to
achieving
my
future
aspirations
offers
the
necessary
skills
and
resources
that
will
provide
me
with
the
competencies
to
learn
how
to
handle
myself
in
a
professional
environment
moreover
to
climb
the
ladder
of
success
i
must
know
how
to
apply
what
i
have
learned
and
excel
in
whatever
field
of
endeavor
i
choose
will
give
me
the
right
educational
path
to
confidently
pursue
any
goal
part
by
going
to
college
i
could
realize
a
variety
of
opportunities
such
as
becoming
a
famous
chef
getting
a
job
or
even
becoming
a
professional
sports
player
also
provides
me
a
chance
to
meet
new
people
participate
in
challenging
activities
take
on
new
adventures
as
well
as
expand
my
understanding
of
the
world
around
me
additionally
college
offers
the
opportunity
to
broaden
my
social
network
thereby
opening
up
possibilities
part
financially
college
can
open
up
a
wealth
of
resources
to
one
s
disposal
from
a
source
of
professional
contacts
to
networking
events
college
provides
access
to
financial
and
job
opportunities
that
one
can
not
otherwise
access
college
also
provides
tuition
assistance
grants
and
scholarships
giving
students
the
opportunity
to
gain
financial
aid
for
their
education
online
learning
can
present
unique
challenges
for
students
as
slow
internet
distractions
and
limited
time
can
significantly
impede
their
ability
to
make
the
most
of
their
educational
experience
for
those
with
slow
internet
downloading
large
files
or
accessing
streaming
content
can
be
difficult
or
even
impossible
in
addition
students
may
struggle
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
if
they
are
being
pulled
away
from
their
studies
by
family
friends
and
other
distractions
lastly
many
students
have
limited
time
to
devote
to
online
learning
either
due
to
school
or
work
obligations
or
due
a
chaotic
lifestyle
there
are
potential
solutions
to
these
challenges
such
as
setting
up
a
dedicated
workspace
that
reduces
distractions
taking
brief
breaks
throughout
the
day
to
refocus
and
scheduling
regular
study
periods
additionally
students
can
proactively
seek
out
faster
more
reliable
internet
connections
and
make
sure
they
are
equipped
with
the
right
hardware
and
software
to
support
online
activities
it
is
also
important
to
break
down
large
projects
or
tasks
into
smaller
chunks
so
that
progress
can
be
made
in
a
timely
manner
if
implemented
effectively
these
solutions
can
be
highly
effective
in
helping
students
to
make
the
most
of
their
online
learning
experience
by
accessing
faster
more
reliable
internet
becoming
organized
in
their
approach
to
studying
and
taking
regular
breaks
to
stay
refreshed
students
can
overcome
the
unique
obstacles
that
online
learning
presents
respect
responsibility
and
kindness
are
life
lessons
that
are
essential
for
a
successful
and
fulfilling
life
respecting
others
being
responsible
in
various
situations
and
expressing
kindness
can
all
shape
us
for
the
better
respect
for
example
is
a
life
lesson
that
we
should
be
constantly
striving
to
practice
respect
for
our
peers
elders
and
culture
should
always
be
taken
into
consideration
responsibilities
like
keeping
promises
doing
well
in

and
respecting
others
should
always
be
kept
in

moreover
expressing
kindness
and
considering
one

is
an
important
behavior
to
maintain
being
kind
to

can
make
a

these
life
lessons
are
especially
important
for
those

appreciate
those
who
demonstrate
respect
and
responsibility
in

s
world
character
is
a
difficult
quality
to
define
can
it
be
measured
is
it
based
on
a
person
s
choices
or
are
we
all
pre destined
by
life
s
influences
of
the
answer
one
can
not
deny
the
role
that
both
choice
and
external
experiences
have
in
shaping
a
person
s
character
for
example
the
choices
a
person
makes
with
regard
to
their
education
and
career
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
their
character
a
person
who
chooses
to
forego
higher
education
and
instead
pursue
their
passions
despite
it
being
considered
unconventional
by
society
and
family
in
turn
demonstrates
their
strength
of
character
courage
and
conviction
conversely
a
person
who
chooses
to
stick
to
a
socially
accepted
career
path
for
the
purpose
of
stability
may
be
said
to
have
a
more
pragmatic
but
less
adventurous
character
on
the
other
hand
external
experiences
can
have
just
as
much
influence
over
a
person
s
character
experiences
ranging
from
loss
hardship
failure
tragedies
or
rewards
such
as
successes
successes
accolades
and
other
forms
of
achievement
can
all
leave
an
indelible
impression
and
shape
a
person
s
character
and
outlook
for
instance
overcoming
adversity
or
tragedy
can
lead
to
a
person
s
resilience
and
empathy
two
qualities
which
can
profoundly
shape
a
person
s
character
similarly
a
person
exposed
to
wealth
and
affluence
may
exhibit
qualities
of
privilege
enabling
them
to
view
the
world
in
a
completely
different
way
in
conclusion
our
character
is
shaped
by
both
our
decisions
and
our
life
s
influences
while
our
decisions
give
us
a
certain
degree
of
control
over
our
life
s
path
events
and
experiences
will
ultimately
shape
us
and
our
reactions
to
them
into
who
we
are
high
school
graduation
is
often
looked
upon
as
a
milestone
for
students
to
celebrate
as
the
end
of
a
long
educational
journey
however
some
school
districts
have
begun
allowing
students
to
graduate
a
year
early
though
this
can
be
beneficial
in
certain
cases
there
are
several
compelling
reasons
why
this
practice
should
not
be
made
universally
available
to
all
high
school
students
most
importantly
graduates
who
jump
the
gun
and
finish
high
school
early
could
be
missing
out
on
valuable
learning
experiences
high
school
is
a
formative
period
and
the
curriculum
is
designed
to
prepare
young
adults
for
college
or
the
workforce
skipping
ahead
by
a
year
could
lead
to
students
not
having
enough
guidance
or
mentorship
available
while
learning
vital
skills
and
life
lessons
in
addition
early
graduation
can
leave
students
feeling
unprepared
for
the
world
outside
of
high
school
not
having
the
same
college
exposure
as
other
peers
or
lacking
the
maturity
that
comes
with
an
extra
year
of
school
can
hold
graduates
back
from
success
in
the
long run
graduating
a
year
earlier
than
expected
does
not
always
mean
students
will
attend
college
earlier
in
fact
it
could
mean
starting
a
career
ill equipped
to
handle
all
the
responsibilities
that
come
with
being
a
full time
working
adult
for
these
reasons
schools
districts
should
not
make
it
possible
for
all
high
school
students
to
graduate
a
year
early
the
benefits
may
be
enticing
but
there
are
many
potential
downsides
to
consider
had
always
been
passionate
about
exploring
different
career
options
so
they
decided
to
take
the
time
to
do
some
research
and
really
think
about
which
one
would
be
best
suited
for
them
they
read
up
about
the
potential
areas
and
benefits
of
various
careers
brainstormed
their
own
ideas
and
discussed
the
possibilities
with
their
parents
teachers
and
counselors
they
also
looked
into
opportunities
outside
of
school
that
could
help
them
along
their
chosen
career
path
after
a
lot
of
thought
and
careful
consideration
finally
decided
on
the
career
that
they
felt
would
perfectly
align
with
their
goals
and
dreams
in
my
pursuit
to
become
an
assistant

past
work
experience
such
an
ability
has
come
in
handy
when
dealing
with
difficult

and
i
am
sure
the
same
would
hold
true
at
this
electronics

altogether
these

experiences
make

the
ideal
candidate
for

i
am
confident
i
can

after
school
homework
clubs
have
become
increasingly
popular
in
recent
years
as
a
way
to
help
students
learn
and
stay
on
top
of
their
school
work
for
many
students
having
a
dedicated
time
and
space
to
do
their
homework
creates
a
better
learning
environment
and
can
help
to
motivate
them
to
get
their
work
done
additionally
after
school
homework
clubs
can
also
provide
students
with
a
more
structured
environment
a
place
to
ask
questions
and
resources
for
assistance
for
teachers
after
school
homework
clubs
provide
an
opportunity
to
monitor
progress
and
give
students
extra
help
when
needed
additionally
teachers
can
use
the
clubs
to
better
understand
their
students
learning
needs
and
tailor
their
teaching
to
address
those
needs
after
school
homework
clubs
have
a
range
of
advantages
for
both
students
and
educators
they
create
an
environment
that
can
promote
learning
and
provide
additional
support
for
students
who
need
it
they
also
provide
teachers
with
added
insight
into
their
students
development
and
progress
extending
the
school
day
by
one
and
a
half
hours
can
offer
a
range
of
academic
benefits
for
students
depending
on
the
activities
available
students
might
be
able
to
spend
extra
time
on
their
studies
and
gain
new
knowledge
and
skills
additionally
longer
school
days
could
provide
students
access
to
speciality
programs
such
as
sports
or
music
and
could
offer
more
time
for
collaboration
in
team
projects
or
mentor
relationships
however
it
is
important
to
examine
the
potential
implications
of
the
extended
learning
time
there
is
the
possibility
that
students
may
experience
undue
pressure
due
to
the
extra
hours
in
school
which
could
lead
to
burnout
or
decreased
motivation
furthermore
the
nutrition
of
students
should
be
considered
particularly
with
regard
to
meals
that
may
be
needed
during
the
extended
hours
in
such
cases
adequate
access
to
food
and
drink
is
essential
an
extended
school
day
has
the
potential
to
positively
impact
a
student
s
academic
performance
but
certain
issues
should
be
addressed
before
making
any
revisions
to
the
current
school
schedule
as
math
students
it
is
essential
to
understand
the
basics
of
math
and
practice
solving
problems
if
you
ever
feel
stuck
do
not
hesitate
to
seek
help
from
family
members
or
teachers
taking
notes
is
also
a
great
way
to
understand
problems
and
find
information
furthermore
modern
technology
provides
us
with
many
online
resources
like
videos
and
websites
to
help
us
out
with
math
having
a
positive
attitude
never
giving
up
and
trusting
in
your
abilities
when
you
believe
you
know
the
answer
is
key
in
successfully
mastering
math
additionally
be
open
to
finding
new
ways
to
answer
questions
never
be
afraid
to
try
something
new
is
a
virtue
that
many
of
us
aspire
to
adhere
to
but
is
it
always
the
best
policy
the
answer
is
not
quite
so
straightforward
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
there
are
occasions
when
telling
a
lie
might
be
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
hurt
feelings
or
potential
consequences
for
example
if
someone
you
know
is
wearing
a
terrible
outfit
telling
them
it
looks
great
may
avoid
them
feeling
embarrassed
and
hurt
another
example
may
include
a
white
lie
to
spare
a
friend
from
knowing
the
truth
about
a
scenario
which
has
no
bearing
on
the
outcome
at
the
same
time
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
honesty
is
generally
the
best
policy
telling
the
truth
is
a
way
of
showing
respect
and
demonstrating
trustworthiness
it
can
also
help
to
build
meaningful
relationships
as
lies
can
inevitably
be
uncovered
which
can
damage
relationships
and
damage
trust
being
honest
can
also
help
to
create
a
sense
of
accountability
leading
to
growth
as
individuals
and
communities
ultimately
each
situation
should
be
judged
on
a
case
by
case
basis
on
certain
occasions
honesty
may
not
always
be
the
best
policy
for
instance
if
a
person
can
be
saved
from
emotional
harm
by
telling
a
white
lie
however
generally
speaking
it
is
wise
to
choose
honesty
as
it
can
foster
strong
relationships
and
lead
towards
positive
growth
as
humans
we
have
a
natural
instinct
to
follow
the
example
of
those
around
us
when
someone
we
look
up
to
demonstrates
a
desired
behavior
such
as
productivity
or
politeness
we
are
far
more
likely
to
model
that
behavior
setting
the
right
example
then
is
an
effective
way
to
influence
those
around
us
this
is
clearly
seen
in
organizations
or
other
teams
of
people
such
as
in
the
military
or
office
settings
leaders
who
demonstrate
a
desire
to
work
together
to
achieve
goals
respect
the
opinions
of
others
and
maintain
a
positive
attitude
build
teams
of
like minded
individuals
similarly
those
who
choose
to
promote
a
culture
of
deceit
hostility
or
laziness
will
find
it
far
more
difficult
to
get
team
members
to
buy
in
and
their
desired
results
will
suffer
speeches
can
also
be
effective
in
influencing
those
around
us
a
well crafted
speech
delivered
with
conviction
passion
and
clarity
can
be
incredibly
impactful
speeches
can
shape
opinions
and
create
cohesion
around
certain
points
of
view
often
elevating
morale
and
inspiring
change
finally
trustworthiness
can
also
be
a
strong
influencer
in
terms
of
human
behavior
individuals
are
far
more
likely
to
heed
the
words
of
those
around
them
if
their
trust
is
well placed
in
that
person
if
someone
has
consistently
proven
themselves
to
be
reliable
honest
and
dependable
those
traits
will
make
others
more
likely
to
be
influenced
by
that
person
in
conclusion
setting
a
good
example
through
one
s
own
behavior
is
an
effective
way
to
influence
those
around
us
but
it
must
be
used
in
conjunction
with
speeches
trustworthiness
and
other
desirable
traits
and
behaviors
to
be
truly
effective
when
the
right
mix
of
these
strategies
is
employed
individuals
can
be
highly
influential
in
society
the
after school
homework
club
is
a
popular
idea
among
elementary
and
middle
school
students
as
it
provides
an
additional
support
system
to
help
them
understand
and
complete
class
assignments
on
the
one
hand
it
can
be
beneficial
for
students
who
need
additional
help
beyond
what
their
teacher
can
provide
in
the
classroom
a
homework
club
can
also
keep
students
off
the
streets
after
school
hours
and
provide
them
with
a
safe
place
to
work
on
their
assignments
on
the
other
hand
there
are
potential
drawbacks
to
having
an
after school
homework
club
many
students
may
use
it
as
a
way
to
procrastinate
and
avoid
doing
their
homework
additionally
it
s
difficult
for
teachers
to
monitor
the
students
progress
in
the
club
and
ensure
that
they
are
on
track
it
can
also
be
expensive
to
run
and
may
not
be
accessible
to
all
students
due
to
the
cost
or
other
factors
therefore
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
having
an
after school
homework
club
ultimately
it
is
up
to
educators
to
decide
if
the
benefits
outweigh
the
potential
drawbacks
and
create
a
homework
club
that
both
meets
the
needs
of
their
students
and
fits
within
their
budgets
attending
school
is
a
vital
step
in
any
individual
s
life
and
is
imperative
to
achieving
future
success
provides
an
array
of
experiences
and
lessons
that
can
not
be
taught
outside
of
the
classroom
education
helps
to
foster
the
development
of
necessary
life
skills
such
as
problem
solving
communication
and
critical
thinking
in
addition
formal
schooling
introduces
students
to
a
number
of
career
pathways
that
can
shape
their
educational
and
professional
paths
for
years
to
come
however
prioritizing
school
is
not
always
a
simple
task
some
students
may
struggle
to
stay
focused
due
to
the
variety
of
distractions
brought
on
by
life
outside
of
the
classroom
financial
obligations
mental
health
issues
and
family
responsibilities
can
take
precedence
and
lead
some
students
astray
from
their
primary
focus
of
attending
school
for
example
was
unable
to
attend
college
due
to
the
financial
strain
and
having
to
become
the
primary
provider
for
her
household
despite
her
determination
to
further
her
studies
she
was
met
with
a
delayed
success
the
importance
of
attending
school
is
inarguable
and
should
not
be
taken
lightly
with
every
educational
opportunity
come
a
multitude
of
greater
opportunities
education
serves
as
the
explorer
s
map
to
success
for
the
future
although
education
does
not
guarantee
the
outcome
it
does
afford
us
the
tools
needed
to
take
us
one
step
closer
to
our
eventual
success
graduating
from
school
is
a
tremendous
accomplishment
and
one
that
should
be
celebrated
it
can
bring
many
benefits
from
the
satisfaction
of
achieving
a
goal
to
having
more
opportunities
for
employment
and
continuing
education
graduating
from
school
requires
hard
work
and
dedication
and
earning
a
diploma
means
that
you
have
completed
the
coursework
set
by
a
particular
school
or
institution
having
a
high
school
diploma
or
even
a
higher
degree
can
open
doors
to
job
opportunities
that
might
not
have
been
available
otherwise
many
jobs
require
that
you
have
a
high
school
diploma
or
equivalent
educational
qualifications
and
having
a
degree
in
a
particular
field
of
study
can
help
to
expand
your
career
prospects
even
further
graduating
from
school
is
not
only
important
for
job
prospects
but
can
also
be
beneficial
for
developing
skills
and
knowledge
in
general
teaches
us
how
to
problem
solve
how
to
think
critically
and
how
to
interact
with
others
in
a
professional
setting
it
also
provides
valuable
socialization
opportunities
and
the
chance
to
make
friends
and
acquaintances
that
can
last
a
lifetime
ultimately
graduation
is
an
important
achievement
and
should
be
celebrated
it
can
give
you
the
skills
and
qualifications
needed
to
start
a
successful
career
and
will
open
many
doors
of
opportunity
that
might
not
be
otherwise
available
the
advantages
of
working
alone
compared
to
working
with
a
group
are
numerous
firstly
working
alone
allows
you
to
have
greater
control
over
the
task
you
re
tackling
you
do
n t
have
to
worry
about
incorporating
another
person
s
ideas
or
accommodating
their
wants
and
needs
secondly
working
alone
gives
you
the
freedom
to
be
as
creative
as
you
d
like
you
can
explore
different
ideas
without
feeling
constrained
by
other
people
s
opinions
lastly
it
can
be
more
efficient
to
work
alone
since
you
have
fewer
obstacles
to
maneuver
this
is
especially
true
for
tasks
that
need
to
be
completed
on
a
tight
timeline
for
example
if
you
re
working
on
an
essay
and
only
have
one
day
to
finish
it
you
ll
likely
work
faster
and
more
efficiently
alone
rather
than
having
to
collaborate
with
a
group
setting
a
good
example
is
an
effective
way
of
influencing
others
as
opposed
to
authoritarian
and
traditional
methods
of
control
people
of
all
ages
respond
positively
to
visible
demonstrations
of
good
behaviour
seeing
someone
else
set
a
good
example
encourages
others
to
follow
suite
it
triggers
the
urge
to
mimic
that
behaviour
and
the
person
setting
the
example
becomes
a
role
model
thereby
setting
off
a
chain
reaction
in
contrast
authoritarian
and
traditional
methods
of
control
are
often
met
with
resentment
and
frustration
as
evidenced
by
numerous
psychological
studies
individuals
struggle
to
accept
and
act
upon
instructions
that
are
imposed
on
them
not
surprisingly
they
also
find
it
difficult
to
embrace
any
positive
behaviour
derived
from
such
enforced
rules
and
regulations
the
effectiveness
of
setting
a
good
example
therefore
should
not
be
underestimated
as
an
influential
tool
it
has
the
power
to
positively
affect
the
behaviour
of
a
large
group
of
people
furthermore
it
can
also
inspire
greatness
within
them
by
triggering
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
integrity
to
conclude
setting
a
good
example
is
an
effective
way
of
inspiring
and
influencing
others
and
should
be
employed
whenever
possible
starting
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
both
beneficial
and
detrimental
to
the
individual
students
who
have
taken
career
classes
at
a
young
age
have
had
mixed
experiences
although
some
have
reaped
great
success
however
embarking
on
a
career
too
soon
can
possibly
backfire
with
students
quitting
courses
and
wasting
time
on
work
that
may
not
benefit
them
in
the
long
run
therefore
it
is
important
for
students
to
think
carefully
before
diving
headlong
into
their
chosen
career
it
is
wise
to
consider
the
best
practices
for
those
considering
starting
a
career
at
an
early
age
preparation
and
research
understanding
of
relevant
skills
and
qualifications
and
finding
balanced
mentors
are
all
critical
elements
that
can
help
someone
to
plan
out
and
thrive
in
their
early
career
ultimately
embarking
on
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
bring
many
rewards
but
has
potential
risks
which
must
be
taken
into
account
when
researching
various
countries
school
requirements
for
high
school
graduation
it
is
important
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
graduating
early
what
are
the
consequences
for
students
that
choose
to
work
instead
of
complete
high
school
in
the
once
a
student
turns
they
are
legally
allowed
to
drop
out
of
school
however
some
states
may
require
a
student
to
complete
certain
classes
in
order
to
get
their
high
school
diploma
additionally
graduating
early
can
have
a
number
of
implications
for
college
and
universities
for
example
students
who
graduate
early
may
have
difficulties
enrolling
in
college
or
receiving
financial
aid
additionally
it
is
important
to
consider
if
the
current
system
of
classes
to
complete
high
school
should
be
changed
and
how
while
the
traditional
four
year
system
is
still
largely
used
by
most
high
schools
some
schools
are
considering
new
ways
of
teaching
with
classes
that
are
shorter
in
duration
and
more
focused
on
a
particular
subject
ultimately
it
is
important
to
consider
all
of
these
factors
when
determining
the
best
high
school
graduation
plan
for
a
young
student
it
is
undeniable
that
our
character
is
an
intrinsic
part
of
who
we
are
it
is
our
individual
character
that
prevents
us
from
succumbing
to
the
more
base
or
undesirable
aspects
of
society
and
instead
enables
us
to
act
in
a
manner
that
is
beneficial
to
ourselves
and
those
around
us
when
considering
how
our
character
is
shaped
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
our
choices
have
a
fundamental
role
it
is
in
fact
the
choices
we
make
which
form
the
bedrock
of
our
character
when
we
make
good
decisions
it
is
likely
that
our
character
will
become
more
virtuous
conversely
if
we
constantly
make
the
wrong
decisions
it
is
likely
that
our
character
will
be
in
decline
it
is
these
choices
which
will
ultimately
define
our
character
and
will
shape
who
we
become
in
the
future
furthermore
if
we
make
decisions
that
benefit
ourselves
and
those
around
us
it
is
likely
that
our
character
is
of
a
higher
caliber
than
if
we
were
to
disregard
the
consequences
of
our
decisions
ultimately
outside
influences
can
have
an
impact
on
our
character
but
it
is
our
decisions
rather
than
external
influences
that
form
the
foundations
of
our
character
therefore
it
is
evident
that
our
individual
choices
play
the
most
significant
role
when
it
comes
to
shaping
our
character
it
is
our
own
decisions
which
determine
our
character
traits
and
ultimately
how
we
view
the
world
and
those
around
us
many
people
have
found
success
despite
failure
oftentimes
even
because
of
it
take
the
case
of
for
example
after
he
was
removed
from
his
role
as
of
in
founded
a
computer
start up
and
ultimately
sold
it
to
at
a
large
profit
this
led
to
his
return
to
where
ironically
he
proved
even
more
successful
engineering
extraordinary
growth
in
s
stock
value
his
experience
proved
that
failure
can
be
a
form
of
learning
an
opportunity
to
experiment
and
acquire
knowledge
that
wouldn
t
have
been
gained
otherwise
behind
successful
individuals
are
often
stories
of
failure
as
was
the
case
with
at
least
some
of
the
factors
contributing
to
his
successful
outcome
included
his
creative
spirit
unwavering
ambition
and
willingness
to
take
risks
traits
made
all
the
more
evident
following
his
initial
failure
freedom
and
respect
are
often
linked
to
success
and
are
rewarding
in
that
they
grant
a
sense
of
control
in
the
individual
s
future
throughout
his
tenure
at
continued
to
hold
exceedingly
high
standards
for
products
and
maintained
a
shrewd
control
over
the
company
s
image
it
is
important
and
satisfying
to
experience
success
following
failure
because
it
signals
progress
and
achievement
though
failure
can
be
a
tough
pill
to
swallow
it
has
proven
to
have
positive
implications
was
able
to
navigate
the
difficult
waters
of
entrepreneurism
becoming
not
only
one
of
the
most
respected
and
well known
business
leaders
of
his
time
but
also
an
icon
of
success
and
perseverance
in
the
face
of
failure
the
debate
over
implementing
a
four day
work
week
in
schools
is
an
ongoing
discussion
in
the
education
system
while
many
view
the
change
with
optimism
there
are
also
several
disadvantages
associated
with
reduced
school
hours
this
essay
will
aim
to
analyze
opinions
from
all
stakeholders
in
the
school
district
considering
the
effects
of
such
a
policy
both
socially
and
financially
the
most
obvious
benefit
of
a
four day
work
week
in
schools
is
the
potential
of
increased
productivity
students
would
be
able
to
spend
more
time
with
their
families
and
pursue
leisure
activities
that
are
not
available
during
regular
school
hours
leading
to
improved
physical
and
mental
health
advocates
of
the
policy
also
mention
that
a
day
off
can
serve
as
a
reward
for
students
who
perform
well
in
classes
however
several
considerations
need
to
be
made
before
implementing
such
a
policy
parents
and
other
staff
members
may
have
difficulties
providing
additional
childcare
or
transportation
services
on
the
extra
day
teachers
would
also
have
to
find
more
creative
ways
to
fit
a
full
week
s
worth
of
material
into
four
days
furthermore
there
could
be
significant
financial
consequences
to
such
a
decision
including
increased
energy
consumption
and
reduced
wages
for
hourly based
employees
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
decision
to
implement
a
four day
work
week
in
schools
is
a
complicated
one
all
stakeholders
in
the
school
district
need
to
voice
their
opinions
and
come
together
to
find
a
compromise
that
works
for
everyone
involved
online
classes
and
homeschooling
offer
several
benefits
to
students
struggling
in
school
those
considering
dropping
out
and
those
eager
to
finish
classes
quickly
for
students
struggling
in
school
they
can
provide
an
alternate
way
to
learn
in
a
safe
and
comfortable
environment
with
tailored
one on one
instruction
for
students
who
are
considering
dropping
out
online
classes
or
homeschooling
can
provide
an
alternate
way
to
complete
their
course
requirements
and
receive
a
diploma
without
having
to
face
the
traditional
school
setting
for
students
who
would
like
to
finish
classes
quickly
online
classes
or
homeschooling
can
provide
them
with
the
flexibility
to
move
at
their
own
pace
and
speed
up
their
education
through
these
methods
of
education
all
sorts
of
students
can
find
success
and
motivation
in
their
studies
as
someone
interested
in
exploring
their
career
options
there
are
a
number
of
steps
to
take
research
available
careers
related
to
your
interests
including
websites
to
explore
the
potential
options
gather
the
academic
and
skills
requirements
of
each
job
you
might
be
interested
in
so
as
to
be
able
to
consider
which
option
is
the
best
for
you
speak
with
a
trusted
teacher
or
counselor
about
your
choices
and
get
advice
about
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
making
a
career
choice
at
a
young
age
to
reflect
on
the
potential
impact
that
choosing
a
career
at
a
young
age
may
have
on
academic
performance
and
other
obligations
with
careful
research
and
open
communication
you
can
be
sure
to
make
an
informed
and
beneficial
decision
we
have
all
heard
the
proverb
that
first
impressions
are
the
most
lasting
but
is
this
always
the
case
considering
one
s
own
experiences
it
is
not
difficult
to
make
the
case
that
first
impressions
are
not
always
fixed
and
can
be
changed
over
time
this
can
be
attributed
to
a
variety
of
factors
such
as
rudeness
shyness
and
a
change
in
personality
take
for
example
a
person
from
any
place
who
is
perceived
as
being
shy
or
reserved
upon
first
meeting
them
even
though
their
initial
interaction
may
be
uneventful
as
time
goes
on
that
person
may
develop
friendships
or
trust
relationships
with
others
allowing
their
true
personality
to
shine
through
this
can
easily
change
the
opinion
of
others
and
may
even
give
them
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
person
s
character
when
it
comes
to
first
impressions
rudeness
can
often
be
a
major
factor
we
all
know
that
this
is
something
to
be
avoided
in
any
social
situation
or
business
establishment
even
when
someone
is
initially
rude
or
abrasive
there
may
be
more
to
the
story
than
first
perceived
taking
the
time
to
get
to
know
a
person
and
understand
their
background
can
often
create
a
different
perspective
on
their
initial
rudeness
finally
it
is
possible
for
a
person
s
personality
to
change
over
time
as
they
go
through
different
life
experiences
despite
initially
coming
across
as
one
way
these
experiences
can
lead
to
growth
empathy
and
knowledge
that
may
alter
how
people
view
them
in
conclusion
first
impressions
may
be
possible
to
change
and
there
are
many
factors
to
consider
in
this
idea
to
this
end
it
is
important
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
get
to
know
people
on
a
deeper
level
only
then
can
we
truly
change
our
views
and
give
everyone
a
second
chance
growing
up
i
ve
always
had
a
hard
time
being
my
true
self
in
the
world
today
from
the
pressures
of
peers
to
the
sometimes
harsh
judgements
of
society
it
can
be
difficult
to
feel
comfortable
in
your
own
skin
i
remember
my
junior
year
of
high
school
when
i
was
really
struggling
to
stay
true
to
my
identity
i
wanted
so
badly
to
follow
the
trends
and
fit
in
with
the
crowd
yet
my
inner
voice
kept
reminding
me
that
i
did
n t
have
to
be
like
everyone
else
it
felt
empowering
to
finally
make
that
decision
and
embrace
my
true
self
in
spite
of
the
pressure
around
me
another
moment
that
stands
out
to
me
is
when
i
was
in
college
and
chose
to
focus
my
studies
on
philosophy
and
history
rather
than
the
more
typical
path
of
business
studies
this
did
n t
sit
too
well
with
my
family
however
i
knew
it
was
my
passion
and
i
could
not
ignore
it
it
took
a
lot
of
courage
for
me
to
go
against
the
grain
and
make
the
decision
to
pursue
a
degree
in
something
that
mattered
to
me
learning
to
be
my
true
self
was
one
of
the
greatest
accomplishments
of
my
life
though
difficult
at
times
it
was
so
worth
it
in
the
end
with
every
step
i
take
towards
embracing
my
true
self
i
feel
more
empowered
and
in
tune
with
my
identity
it
s
a
liberating
process
that
i
could
n t
recommend
enough
to
others
who
are
struggling
to
break
their
own
barriers
as
well
is
currently
considering
the
implementation
of
a
four
day
school
week
reducing
the
school
s
standard
five
day
week
to
four
days
while
this
would
clearly
cut
down
on
operational
costs
there
are
also
many
potential
drawbacks
to
consider
on
the
positive
side
the
four
day
school
week
would
allow
school
administrators
the
flexibility
to
cut
costs
in
various
ways
such
as
reducing
the
number
of
teachers
needed
and
increasing
teacher
salaries
it
would
also
give
students
more
time
to
pursue
extracurricular
activities
that
support
academic
and
social
development
however
there
are
some
potential
negative
consequences
to
a
four
day
school
week
with
fewer
days
for
class
lectures
and
instruction
students
may
have
less
of
an
opportunity
for
direct
contact
with
their
teachers
and
for
subject specific
tutoring
additionally
shorter
days
can
lead
to
more
disruptions
which
can
hinder
overall
academic
performance
overall
it
is
difficult
to
definitively
determine
whether
a
four
day
school
week
is
a
beneficial
option
for
while
there
are
potential
cost
savings
in
reducing
the
school
week
it
is
important
to
consider
all
of
the
implications
of
this
change
before
making
a
final
decision
the
old
adage
of
if
at
first
you
do
n t
succeed
try
again
exemplifies
one
of
the
most
essential
elements
for
achieving
success
in
life
that
element
is
determination
the
unwavering
drive
and
commitment
to
persist
in
the
pursuit
of
one
s
aspirations
an
often told
story
involving
a
spider
perfectly
demonstrates
this
concept
no
matter
how
many
times
the
spider
fell
from
the
ceiling
it
continued
to
climb
back
up
never
giving
up
until
it
reached
its
goal
although
this
fable
is
an
exaggeration
it
does
serve
as
a
metaphor
for
never
relenting
in
the
face
of
adversity
failure
is
inevitable
in
life
however
failure
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
roadblock
to
success
but
rather
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
in
order
to
overcome
failure
and
succeed
in
the
long
run
one
must
remain
vigilant
and
be
encouraged
to
keep
striving
for
excellence
furthermore
having
enthusiasm
for
one
s
goals
is
a
major
factor
in
achieving
success
as
it
cultivates
motivation
and
brings
passion
to
the
process
strides
in
life
can
also
be
made
through
hard
work
and
dedication
pouring
all
of
one
s
effort
into
their
ambitions
can
open
many
doors
for
opportunities
that
will
otherwise
be
missed
in
order
to
make
the
best
of
those
opportunities
the
key
is
to
keep
going
and
refuse
to
back
down
from
any
challenge
that
may
arise
by
sticking
to
one
s
convictions
and
being
caffeinated
by
determination
encouragement
enthusiasm
and
hard
work
success
can
be
attained
in
the
same
way
the
spider
never
wavered
from
its
goal
inspire
yourself
to
adopt
the
same
unwavering
attitude
and
achieve
your
goals
no
matter
what
stands
in
your
way
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
is
an
intriguing
proposition
that
has
gained
significant
traction
in
the
last
few
years
on
the
one
hand
completion
ahead
of
schedule
is
an
attractive
concept
to
many
students
who
are
eager
to
begin
college
and
make
an
impact
on
the
world
additionally
many
students
are
self directed
and
mature
enough
to
handle
the
rigors
of
completing
high
school
early
on
the
other
hand
however
there
are
a
few
potential
drawbacks
to
consider
the
most
significant
concern
is
that
students
may
miss
out
on
important
experiences
such
as
extracurricular
activities
or
even
friendships
if
they
leave
high
school
too
quickly
without
these
experiences
students
may
struggle
to
develop
the
very
skills
necessary
for
academic
and
professional
success
overall
whether
or
not
completing
high
school
in
three
years
is
a
good
idea
is
a
decision
that
will
vary
from
person
to
person
while
it
may
be
a
great
option
for
certain
individuals
who
are
ready
to
move
on
to
the
next
phase
of
their
lives
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
and
ensure
that
students
are
still
able
to
enjoy
and
benefit
from
the
high
school
experience
working
in
a
group
has
many
advantages
compared
to
working
alone
one
benefit
of
working
in
a
group
is
that
it
allows
multiple
perspectives
and
ideas
to
be
discussed
compared
and
explored
with
a
variety
of
different
ideas
being
discussed
more
comprehensive
solutions
can
be
developed
having
peers
to
motivate
and
support
each
other
can
also
be
beneficial
to
the
progress
of
a
project
or
task
for
example
if
one
person
is
stuck
on
a
certain
task
their
peers
can
help
them
brainstorm
and
come
up
with
a
solution
however
working
in
a
group
can
also
be
a
challenge
team
dynamics
and
disharmony
can
impede
the
progress
of
the
task
or
project
it
can
also
be
hard
to
remain
focused
when
others
are
discussing
topics
unrelated
to
the
task
at
hand
working
alone
can
help
to
prevent
this
distraction
additionally
everyone
is
often
expected
to
contribute
in
a
group
setting
while
working
alone
can
allow
an
individual
to
work
at
their
own
pace
or
within
a
comfortable
space
however
if
support
or
advice
is
necessary
it
can
be
difficult
to
obtain
when
working
alone
first
impressions
can
have
a
lasting
impact
we
often
associate
positive
qualities
to
people
or
animals
we
meet
for
the
first
time
based
solely
on
how
they
appear
or
even
the
first
few
words
they
speak
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
first
impressions
can
be
changed
over
time
with
further
knowledge
and
experience
take
for
example
my
college
roommate
when
i
first
met
him
i
could
not
help
but
assume
that
he
was
arrogant
and
uncaring
however
after
living
together
for
a
few
months
i
came
to
find
that
he
was
actually
a
loving
and
considerate
person
who
put
a
significant
effort
into
bettering
himself
in
all
aspects
of
life
similar
trends
apply
to
animals
too
our
pet
dog
was
feral
when
we
first
adopted
her
but
soon
became
the
most
friendly
and
gentle
creature
one
can
imagine
clearly
it
is
natural
to
form
an
impression
of
someone
or
something
based
on
one
s
first
impressions
but
it
is
equally
important
to
not
become
complacent
and
instead
give
them
a
chance
to
demonstrate
who
and
what
they
truly
are
it
is
undeniable
that
hearing
different
pieces
of
advice
from
many
different
people
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
our
lives
in
my
own
life
i
ve
experienced
the
positive
and
negative
consequences
of
taking
in
input
from
many
diverse
sources
when
i
was
considering
taking
a
gap
year
prior
to
college
i
sought
out
advice
from
many
people
ranging
from
family
and
friends
to
teachers
and
mentors
while
some
people
cautioned
me
about
the
risks
of
taking
such
a
break
others
advised
me
to
trust
my
instinct
and
go
for
it
ultimately
i
decided
to
follow
my
heart
and
take
the
leap
that
has
been
one
of
the
best
decisions
i
have
ever
made
as
it
provided
me
with
invaluable
experiences
and
personal
growth
this
is
an
example
of
the
potential
benefits
of
listening
to
multiple
sources
of
input
however
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
there
can
be
adverse
outcomes
of
absorbing
advice
from
too
many
people
for
example
a
friend
of
mine
was
considering
switching
career
paths
but
was
overwhelmed
with
the
multitude
of
opposing
views
from
people
in
her
life
in
the
end
she
felt
confused
and
frustrated
and
failed
to
take
any
decisive
action
this
illustrates
how
too
many
voices
can
paralyze
an
individual
and
cause
them
to
become
stuck
in
a
state
of
indecision
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
to
bear
in
mind
that
listening
to
multiple
pieces
of
advice
from
various
people
can
be
beneficial
but
there
is
an
inherent
danger
of
feeling
overwhelmed
and
stuck
with
too
many
opposing
views
we
must
strive
to
seek
out
the
opinions
of
those
closest
to
us
as
well
as
respected
mentors
and
be
cognizant
of
when
to
trust
our
own
judgment
and
take
decisive
action
the
philosopher
once
said
we
all
have
character
traits
that
we
have
to
consciously
create
or
allow
to
be
influenced
by
others
this
statement
prompts
the
idea
that
our
character
is
shaped
by
our
mindset
and
environment
we
all
have
the
power
to
choose
what
kind
of
people
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
surrounded
by
and
in
turn
by
the
company
we
keep
can
shape
our
character
and
our
decisions
the
decisions
and
actions
we
take
can
lead
to
positive
or
negative
outcomes
in
the
formation
of
our
character
having
a
positive
mindset
motivates
us
to
reach
our
goals
in
life
and
in
doing
so
will
shape
our
character
it
is
all
about
having
the
courage
to
go
out
and
take
action
to
help
create
positive
character
traits
and
habits
we
all
have
the
power
and
potential
to
shape
and
mold
our
character
but
it
is
up
to
us
to
have
the
will
power
and
perseverance
to
take
the
necessary
steps
as
a
proud
member
of
a
certain
religion
i
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
researching
its
many
benefits
and
the
important
cultural
practices
that
it
advocates
for
not
only
do
religious
and
spiritual
teachings
bring
comfort
and
community
but
believers
can
draw
strength
and
renewal
from
dedicated
practice
in
addition
my
preferred
government
party
is
known
for
delivering
on
their
ambitious
campaign
promises
providing
their
constituents
with
a
reliable
sense
of
stability
security
and
assurance
in
my
country
there
is
also
an
abundance
of
interesting
and
unique
features
that
make
it
a
worthwhile
tourist
destination
from
its
stunning
scenery
to
its
diverse
range
of
specialty
cuisine
it
is
a
place
rich
in
culture
and
captivating
experiences
by
carefully
utilizing
all
of
these
elements
i
have
found
i
can
easily
impress
someone
explaining
the
way
each
factor
contributes
to
my
home
s
uniqueness
makes
for
an
interesting
conversation
and
demonstrates
a
passion
for
my
community
as
technology
has
advanced
it
has
become
much
easier
to
use
online
services
to
do
the
activities
we
used
to
do
in
person
while
this
has
improved
many
aspects
of
our
lives
it
has
also
had
some
negative
effects
in
the
form
of
limiting
our
contact
with
other
people
this
effect
can
be
seen
when
we
look
at
shopping
communication
and
children
s
activities
as
in
each
of
these
situations
we
have
decreased
our
contact
with
others
and
increased
our
reliance
on
technology
to
begin
with
consider
shopping
rather
than
going
out
to
the
store
many
people
now
turn
to
online
ordering
relying
on
technology
to
bring
items
to
their
doorstep
this
not
only
results
in
less
interaction
with
public
spaces
and
salespeople
but
it
also
reduces
the
amount
of
human
contact
for
example
shopping
for
clothes
used
to
involve
visiting
stores
with
friends
trying
on
different
outfits
and
interacting
with
store
employees
for
advice
and
help
now
we
order
clothing
online
and
often
lose
out
on
the
social
experience
and
human
contact
that
comes
with
in person
shopping
technology
has
also
impacted
how
we
communicate
people
no
longer
rely
on
writing
letters
making
phone
calls
or
going
for
coffee
to
catch
up
with
friends
but
instead
most
have
taken
to
texting
messaging
or
social
media
this
form
of
communication
has
its
advantages
but
it
s
also
led
to
the
lack
of
human
contact
in
our
day
to
day
conversations
we
often
miss
out
on
the
nuances
and
subtlety
that
occurs
with
face
to
face
conversations
and
this
impairment
of
connection
can
have
an
effect
on
how
we
ultimately
communicate
and
understand
people
in
our
lives
finally
technology
has
also
limited
the
contact
between
children
and
other
people
playdates
for
instance
have
been
replaced
by
virtual
connections
and
rather
than
going
out
for
adventures
or
gathering
with
friends
children
are
now
having
to
stay
inside
and
use
their
digital
devices
as
their
primary
source
of
entertainment
and
social
stimulation
this
can
be
particularly
damaging
as
it
limits
the
development
of
their
communication
skills
and
the
opportunity
to
interact
with
people
their
own
age
in
conclusion
while
technology
has
had
many
positive
impacts
in
our
lives
it
has
led
to
a
significant
reduction
in
physical
contact
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
intangible
aspects
of
human
connection
and
ensure
that
technology
is
used
as
an
enhancement
rather
than
a
substitute
to
do
this
we
must
take
steps
to
prioritize
in person
contact
such
as
going
out
for
regular
coffee
dates
with
friends
visiting
stores
and
encouraging
our
children
to
get
out
and
i
recently
experienced
a
situation
that
perfectly
illustrates
the
importance
of
standing
up
for
oneself
and
staying
true
to
who
you
are
despite
the
pressure
to
conform
to
society
s
expectations
while
attending
college
i
noticed
that
a
lot
of
the
people
around
me
took
great
pride
in
simply
acquiring
the
same
belongings
and
looks
as
everyone
else
this
mentality
was
pervasive
and
i
felt
the
pressure
to
do
the
same
but
instead
of
succumbing
to
this
pressure
i
chose
to
embrace
my
own
interests
and
individuality
i
found
that
as
i
stayed
true
to
myself
i
gained
a
greater
sense
of
respect
from
my
peers
even
through
this
experience
this
was
a
great
reminder
of
why
being
true
to
oneself
is
so
essential
especially
in
a
society
that
constantly
attempts
to
shape
us
into
someone
else
in
recent
years
cell
phones
have
increasingly
become
part
of
the
educational
landscape
educators
are
exploring
ways
to
use
cell
phones
as
a
learning
tool
in
the
classroom
as
they
can
provide
a
great
and
convenient
way
to
engage
students
in
learning
proponents
of
using
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
argue
that
cell
phones
can
be
used
to
access
online
educational
resources
to
aid
in
learning
in
real
time
and
to
facilitate
communication
and
collaboration
among
students
at
the
same
time
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
using
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
they
can
be
distracting
to
students
and
take
away
from
time
that
could
be
used
for
more
traditional
learning
activities
some
research
has
also
suggested
that
using
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
can
lead
to
decreased
classroom
engagement
and
learning
as
students
are
more
likely
to
become
distracted
by
texting
and
social
media
in
my
opinion
using
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
can
be
beneficial
as
a
supplement
to
traditional
learning
activities
provided
that
they
are
used
properly
and
monitored
appropriately
by
educators
phones
can
provide
an
engaging
and
convenient
way
for
students
to
acquire
knowledge
in
a
digital
world
but
ultimately
the
teacher
needs
to
make
sure
that
cell
phone
use
does
not
disrupt
the
learning
process
as
our
school
s
principal
i
m
sure
you
are
aware
of
the
rising
issue
of
phone
usage
in
classrooms
there
is
no
denying
that
there
are
certain
drawbacks
to
allowing
phones
to
be
used
in
schools
such
as
potential
for
distraction
and
abuse
of
technology
fortunately
i
believe
that
policy
number
concerning
phone
usage
can
bring
more
benefits
than
drawbacks
to
our
students
for
starters
many
students
use
their
phones
for
organizational
purposes
such
as
setting
reminders
of
upcoming
assignments
and
activities
by
allowing
these
students
to
access
their
phones
in
moderation
during
class
they
are
able
to
stay
on
top
of
their
studies
and
stay
productive
this
will
help
to
promote
a
more
academic
and
organized
atmosphere
in
our
classes
additionally
using
phones
can
be
a
great
educational
resource
through
apps
and
websites
students
have
access
to
a
wealth
of
information
which
can
foster
greater
student
engagement
and
facilitate
more
meaningful
class
discussions
furthermore
students
can
use
their
phones
to
snap
photos
of
course
materials
and
diagrams
for
future
reference
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
during
class
can
bring
about
many
educational
benefits
which
aid
in
fostering
an
enriching
learning
environment
i
therefore
believe
that
policy
number
concerning
phone
usage
is
the
most
beneficial
for
our
students
developing
good
habits
and
having
a
positive
work
ethic
can
lead
to
unparalleled
success
the
adage
no
pain
no
gain
rings
true
here
as
hard
work
and
dedication
tend
to
be
the
ideal
ingredients
for
setting
oneself
apart
from
the
competition
while
it
is
tempting
to
indulge
in
inactivity
and
be
content
with
minimal
effort
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
a
lack
of
productivity
is
a
danger
to
personal
fulfillment
and
advancement
once
said
is
the
mother
of
good
luck
a
sentiment
that
speaks
to
the
power
and
rewards
of
perseverance
by
investing
in
ourselves
through
hard
work
and
commitment
we
proudly
set
ourselves
up
for
success
adopting
a
weekday
curfew
for
teenagers
can
be
viewed
as
both
advantageous
and
disadvantageous
on
the
one
hand
instituting
a
curfew
could
lead
to
improved
safety
by
providing
greater
supervision
for
teenagers
after
dark
and
ensuring
they
don
t
remain
in
dangerous
or
unfamiliar
areas
it
can
also
help
promote
better
sleeping
and
eating
habits
leaving
teenagers
more
rested
and
alert
for
their
daily
activities
on
the
other
hand
a
curfew
can
be
seen
as
overly
restrictive
leaving
teens
feeling
as
though
they
have
limited
freedom
and
unable
to
participate
in
evening
activities
it
can
also
detract
from
academic
performance
as
teens
may
be
unable
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
or
study
later
in
the
night
and
as
such
it
may
put
them
at
a
disadvantage
overall
it
is
clear
that
enforcing
a
curfew
for
teenagers
has
both
its
pros
and
cons
but
ultimately
it
should
be
decided
on
a
case by case
basis
if
a
curfew
is
deemed
necessary
authorities
should
consider
the
importance
of
communication
extracurricular
involvement
and
overall
wellbeing
to
ensure
that
teens
are
getting
the
most
out
of
their
time
after
dark
excerpt
the
notion
that
example
is
the
main
thing
that
influences
others
has
been
around
for
centuries
this
idea
has
been
proven
true
in
my
own
life
through
two
distinct
experiences
the
first
experience
was
when
i
was
a
teenager
and
i
noticed
how
my
behavior
and
the
way
i
carried
myself
had
a
direct
impact
on
my
friends
they
began
to
mimic
my
mannerisms
and
behaviors
and
even
started
adopting
some
of
my
interests
the
second
experience
was
when
i
entered
the
professional
world
and
noticed
how
my
presence
attitude
and
professionalism
had
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
people
around
me
my
co workers
responded
to
my
enthusiasm
and
commitment
to
my
job
and
i
witnessed
tangible
results
in
the
organization
s
success
from
these
two
experiences
it
is
clear
that
example
is
a
powerful
and
influential
thing
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
in
life
s
important
matters
can
have
substantial
benefits
using
my
own
experiences
as
an
example
i
have
consulted
with
mentors
to
gain
insight
into
my
professional
and
personal
goals
i
ve
also
heard
stories
from
acquaintances
who
experienced
success
by
following
the
advice
from
a
spiritual
advisor
or
by
consulting
with
an
expert
in
their
field
in
addition
examining
advice
from
different
cultures
and
interventions
from
varying
sources
of
ideas
can
help
individuals
formulate
a
plan
that
will
help
them
achieve
their
intended
goals
having
the
courage
to
communicate
with
these
individuals
is
an
important
tool
for
gaining
insight
though
it
is
not
always
easy
to
do
so
without
taking
the
proper
steps
individuals
may
lack
the
important
information
and
may
face
negative
consequences
such
as
time
and
money
lost
or
an
increase
in
stress
and
anxiety
ultimately
the
importance
of
proper
guidance
from
outside
sources
can
not
be
overlooked
in
life
s
important
matters
distance
learning
has
become
increasingly
popular
over
the
years
as
a
way
for
students
to
continue
their
education
in
a
variety
of
settings
it
offers
many
advantages
such
as
providing
access
to
students
in
special
cases
better
attendance
and
less
school related
issues
however
it
is
said
that
distance
learning
can
also
lead
to
an
environment
in
which
students
become
lazy
miss
out
on
important
social
interaction
and
lack
accountability
on
one
hand
distance
learning
enables
access
to
those
with
special
needs
who
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
attend
traditional
educational
institutions
it
also
provides
them
with
an
environment
of
convenience
since
they
do
not
have
to
physically
attend
the
classes
in
order
to
learn
and
the
accessibility
of
technology
means
they
have
access
to
content
whether
they
are
in
the
classroom
or
learning
from
home
learning
also
allows
an
improved
capability
of
attendance
since
no
transport
is
required
and
this
can
help
to
better
facilitate
learning
for
some
students
finally
distance
learning
eliminates
issues
that
can
arise
from
a
school
environment
such
as
bullying
peer
pressure
or
issue related
distractions
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
disadvantages
related
to
distance
learning
for
example
due
to
the
lack
of
a
physical
environment
there
is
the
potential
for
less
involvement
from
the
students
this
can
lead
to
them
feeling
lazier
or
less
likely
to
put
in
the
effort
of
attending
class
and
performing
well
in
their
studies
furthermore
distance
learning
also
leads
to
a
lack
of
social
interaction
as
students
are
unable
to
engage
in
real
conversations
with
their
peers
or
interact
with
their
teachers
in
a
way
that
would
be
done
if
they
were
in
a
regular
class
additionally
there
is
less
accountability
in
distance
learning
as
students
may
not
feel
the
same
level
of
pressure
to
deliver
as
they
would
if
they
were
attending
a
physical
class
ultimately
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
distance
learning
although
there
is
an
advantage
for
those
with
special
needs
it
can
also
lead
to
an
environment
in
which
students
may
become
lazy
lack
social
interaction
and
experience
a
decreased
level
of
accountability
educators
should
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
distance
learning
carefully
before
implementing
it
in
their
educational
institutions
when
it
comes
to
researching
possible
career
paths
that
align
with
a
student
s
interests
and
knowledge
it
is
important
to
explore
all
of
their
options
and
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
of
them
gaining
experience
in
the
workplace
can
be
extremely
beneficial
and
understanding
one
s
work
ethic
and
how
to
approach
one
s
boss
are
key
components
to
success
internships
are
also
an
important
source
of
experience
and
knowledge
as
they
can
offer
a
range
of
skills
and
expertise
that
can
not
be
taught
with
all
this
in
mind
it
is
important
to
help
the
student
find
a
job
or
path
that
interests
them
and
will
help
them
develop
their
skills
further
with
the
right
guidance
the
student
can
become
a
valuable
and
successful
part
of
the
workforce
working
with
a
group
on
school
assignments
can
be
beneficial
for
students
as
it
can
help
them
learn
new
skills
find
solutions
to
problems
and
break
down
complicated
concepts
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
can
have
its
own
advantages
such
as
allowing
students
to
work
at
their
own
pace
and
ensuring
that
they
get
full
credit
for
their
work
ultimately
both
approaches
have
their
pros
and
cons
and
students
should
decide
which
approach
works
best
for
them
in
particular
working
with
a
group
can
be
a
great
choice
for
students
because
it
allows
for
collaboration
and
shared
responsibility
among
team
members
not
only
can
this
make
the
project
more
manageable
and
enjoyable
but
it
can
also
help
foster
teamwork
and
problem solving
skills
essential
for
success
in
the
future
moreover
working
with
a
group
can
also
give
students
access
to
a
greater
range
of
perspectives
allowing
each
member
to
learn
from
one
another
s
ideas
and
abilities
for
these
reasons
students
should
consider
voting
to
work
in
a
group
on
school
assignments
attending
school
and
taking
online
classes
or
video
conferences
are
both
popular
educational
approaches
these
days
but
they
differ
in
several
ways
attending
school
requires
students
to
physically
go
to
a
classroom
and
interact
with
their
teacher
and
fellow
students
while
taking
online
classes
or
video
conferences
especially
during
the
pandemic
means
that
students
can
learn
from
home
there
are
several
advantages
and
drawbacks
to
attending
school
compared
to
taking
online
classes
or
video
conferences
one
big
advantage
of
attending
school
is
the
hands on
learning
opportunities
as
students
get
to
participate
in
experiments
and
practical
projects
which
are
impossible
to
do
online
additionally
attending
school
gives
students
the
chance
to
develop
crucial
social
skills
like
working
together
and
communication
which
are
essential
for
success
in
life
but
are
not
possible
in
online
classes
or
video
conferences
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
taking
online
classes
or
video
conferences
is
that
students
can
have
a
flexible
learning
schedule
and
study
according
to
their
own
pace
ultimately
attending
school
is
more
effective
for
students
in
the
long
run
as
it
offers
a
more
comprehensive
educational
approach
having
an
experienced
teacher
to
guide
students
in
the
classroom
and
take
care
of
when
they
are
having
difficulties
is
much
more
beneficial
than
learning
all
by
themselves
at
home
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
attending
school
is
important
for
students
from
lower income
families
as
it
provides
structure
in
their
lives
and
the
resources
they
need
to
pursue
higher
education
which
are
not
always
easily
accessible
in
conclusion
while
taking
online
classes
or
video
conferences
can
be
attractive
due
to
convenience
attending
school
is
ultimately
a
more
efficient
approach
for
students
to
gain
the
necessary
academic
progress
and
crucial
skills
it
is
important
for
students
to
make
use
of
the
resources
that
attending
school
offers
in
order
to
further
their
educational
goals
in
the
long
run
had
to
make
an
important
life
decision
about
his
career
path
he
felt
that
the
best
way
to
approach
it
was
to
make
the
decision
on
his
own
though
he
had
contemplated
multiple
scenarios
he
was
n t
sure
what
choice
would
be
the
best
for
his
long term
success
he
made
the
choice
without
consulting
any
experts
or
authorities
and
soon
found
himself
in
a
difficult
situation
he
had
chosen
a
path
that
was
promising
in
the
short term
but
led
to
a
dead end
in
the
long run
on
the
other
hand
had
consulted
experts
or
authorities
about
his
life
s
important
matters
his
decision
may
have
been
different
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
generally
makes
life
easier
since
they
are
more
informed
and
experienced
in
a
certain
area
furthermore
it
can
lead
to
a
successful
life
in
the
long term
in
addition
to
their
expertise
experts
and
authorities
are
also
better
equipped
to
consider
all
the
potential
risks
and
outcomes
of
a
situation
making
them
an
important
source
of
guidance
imagination
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
be
used
to
unlock
limitless
knowledge
and
drive
creativity
drawing
from
practical
examples
from
everyday
life
inventions
in
our
modern
world
and
educational
stories
this
essay
will
show
why
it
is
important
to
use
imagination
in
knowledge
imagination
allows
us
to
think
creatively
and
find
solutions
to
existing
problems
in
everyday
life
we
utilize
our
creative
thinking
skills
to
help
us
plan
for
the
future
and
solve
everyday
issues
for
example
when
faced
with
the
dilemma
of
a
limited
budget
to
furnish
a
room
one
might
use
their
imagination
to
think
of
more
cost effective
alternatives
such
as
purchasing
furniture
from
second hand
stores
or
repurposing
already
owned
materials
imagination
is
an
essential
component
in
modern
inventions
for
example
engineers
use
imagination
to
construct
inventions
that
revolutionize
the
world
many
of
the
modern
inventions
we
find
today
such
as
the
iphone
could
n t
have
been
created
without
engineers
using
their
imagination
to
dream
of
a
better
future
finally
imagination
is
used
in
educational
stories
to
teach
lessons
that
can
be
applied
to
real
life
scenarios
for
example
by
using
vivid
imagery
and
imaginative
characters
stories
allow
the
reader
to
put
themselves
in
the
character
s
shoes
empathize
with
them
and
learn
lessons
on
how
to
best
traverse
a
problem
in
this
way
stories
can
successfully
use
imagination
to
teach
strong
lessons
that
can
be
applied
to
real
life
in
summary
imagination
has
proven
to
be
an
essential
component
in
everyday
life
modern
inventions
and
educational
stories
by
using
imagination
we
have
been
able
to
find
creative
solutions
build
revolutionary
inventions
and
learn
important
lessons
from
educational
stories
therefore
it
is
important
to
use
imagination
in
knowledge
for
many
people
who
want
to
achieve
something
significant
in
life
setting
goals
is
a
crucial
step
in
the
effort
of
reaching
that
success
goals
provide
clarity
set
expectations
and
can
help
keep
someone
on
track
and
focused
on
their
end
goal
when
setting
these
objectives
it
is
important
to
consider
the
level
of
difficulty
and
the
expected
growth
one
will
experience
when
setting
goals
to
a
higher
level
there
are
clear
benefits
that
can
be
seen
compared
to
setting
goals
to
a
low
level
to
begin
setting
goals
to
a
higher
level
forces
an
individual
to
challenge
themselves
and
grow
in
order
to
reach
that
end
goal
achieving
more
difficult
goals
can
not
only
provide
a
sense
of
success
and
pride
but
also
can
give
validation
to
progress
made
and
a
sense
of
growth
reaching
higher
level
objectives
can
also
open
up
the
possibility
to
more
as
putting
extra
effort
into
a
task
or
achieving
a
goal
that
seems
extreme
can
open
up
myriad
of
other
opportunities
that
one
may
not
have
had
access
to
before
furthermore
challenging
goals
can
provide
someone
with
a
variety
of
intellectual
physical
and
emotional
experiences
that
will
be
beneficial
in
the
long
run
in
this
way
one
can
find
growth
in
all
aspects
and
gain
knowledge
that
will
remain
with
them
for
a
lifetime
however
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
type
of
growth
comes
with
a
certain
cost
setting
higher
level
goals
can
require
extra
focus
time
energy
and
other
resources
that
may
have
a
financial
or
emotional
consequence
moreover
if
the
goal
is
too
far
out
of
reach
it
can
lead
to
a
sense
of
failure
and
an
unwillingness
to
keep
striving
towards
the
goal
overall
setting
goals
to
a
higher
level
provides
one
with
more
growth
and
a
greater
sense
of
success
compared
to
setting
goals
at
a
lower
level
in
terms
of
experiences
awareness
and
knowedge
on
the
other
hand
it
is
important
to
keep
a
sense
of
balance
when
setting
goals
as
to
not
end
up
overwhelmed
or
taken
aback
if
the
goal
is
out
of
reach
doing
so
can
help
one
reach
to
the
top
without
sacrificing
too
much
and
experiencing
the
most
benefit
presents
an
interesting
point
in
his
quote
that
it
is
important
to
remain
active
and
that
being
idle
will
forever
hinder
one
s
success
in
life
by
failing
to
do
something
one
never
has
the
chance
to
realize
just
how
much
can
be
achieved
it
is
simply
impossible
for
an
individual
to
reach
their
goals
if
they
do
not
strive
and
take
the
initiative
to
do
something
for
a
purpose
certainly
simply
waiting
and
expecting
to
achieve
success
while
never
taking
any
action
will
surely
result
in
failure
serves
no
purpose
in
this
quote
and
makes
it
clear
that
taking
action
is
key
to
achieving
success
this
quote
is
a
powerful
reminder
of
how
hard
work
and
determination
can
help
one
reach
their
goals
and
how
being
idle
will
only
lead
to
despair
versus
idleness
is
a
common
debate
but
the
advantages
of
a
productive
lifestyle
are
undeniable
indicates
that
actively
working
to
achieve
goals
increases
energy
levels
strengthens
mental
focus
and
boosts
motivation
moreover
successful
people
often
gain
greater
recognition
due
to
the
hard
work
they
put
in
on
the
other
hand
living
an
idle
life
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
one
s
life
those
who
are
idle
are
more
likely
to
suffer
from
depression
or
anxiety
and
have
far
fewer
career
opportunities
in
terms
of
physical
and
mental
benefits
people
who
work
productively
often
experience
a
stronger
sense
of
purpose
and
fulfillment
in
life
compared
to
those
who
choose
to
be
idle
additionally
the
expression
time
is
money
rings
true
when
it
comes
to
productive
work
as
the
more
one
puts
into
a
task
the
higher
the
financial
rewards
can
be
therefore
it
is
essential
to
recognize
the
significance
of
productive
work
and
to
strive
for
success
of
i
am
writing
to
express
my
interest
in
learning
more
about
careers
in
the
police
force
i
recently
completed
criminology
classes
and
am
fascinated
with
the
opportunities
to
put
knowledge
into
action
i
would
be

to
be
able
to
visit
your

and
experience
the
work
first hand
i
am
passionate
about
using
my
skills
and
knowledge
to
effect
positive
change
in
my
community
and
the
greater
world
i
believe
that
the
police
force
plays
an
important
role
in
protecting
and
serving
the
public
and
i
am
eager
to
learn
more
about
how
i
might
be
able
to
contribute
to
such
an
honorable
cause
i
look
forward
to
your
reply
and
i
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
my
letter
sincerely

staying
occupied
has
a
number
of
benefits
from
increased
mental
health
to
greater
overall
satisfaction
with
life
studies
have
consistently
shown
that
proactively
completing
tasks
is
more
beneficial
than
procrastinating
or
being
inactive
higher
productivity
leads
to
better
goal
achievement
and
overall
success
studies
of
teenagers
have
revealed
that
staying
occupied
and
productive
can
help
lead
to
successful
goal
achievement
for
example
a
high
school
senior
set
an
ambitious
goal
to
be
accepted
into
her
first choice
college
she
stayed
motivated
and
productive
throughout
the
application
process
and
was
ultimately
accepted
into
her
dream
school
alternatively
a
college
freshman
struggled
to
stay
productive
and
inactive
lifestyle
kept
him
from
achieving
his
goals
was
barely
passing
his
classes
and
as
a
result
his
future
career
plans
were
delayed
these
two
cases
illustrate
the
key
differences
between
staying
occupied
and
being
inactive
staying
occupied
is
essential
for
goal
achievement
while
being
inactive
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
life
ambitions
taking
a
class
in
a
classroom
setting
as
opposed
to
taking
one
online
can
offer
a
variety
of
distinct
benefits
in
a
traditional
classroom
setting
students
may
benefit
from
face to face
discussion
and
interactions
with
their
peers
developing
a
stronger
sense
of
community
that
can
encourage
higher
engagement
in
class
activities
additionally
the
scheduled
class
time
can
be
helpful
for
students
in
developing
a
regular
routine
for
studying
and
completing
assignments
as
well
as
for
keeping
themselves
on
track
furthermore
being
physically
present
in
a
classroom
allows
the
student
to
feel
more
connected
to
their
instructor
which
can
provide
regular
feedback
on
assignments
and
help
to
ensure
progress
being
in
a
classroom
setting
also
offers
access
to
hands on
learning
which
can
be
immensely
beneficial
for
certain
subjects
such
as
physics
chemistry
and
engineering
a
physical
classroom
setting
allows
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
material
as
students
are
able
to
interact
directly
with
the
instructor
and
receive
demonstrations
firsthand
in
contrast
taking
courses
online
can
have
its
advantages
as
well
courses
online
are
often
more
convenient
and
can
be
taken
at
any
time
from
the
comfort
of
the
student
s
own
home
additionally
depending
on
the
course
materials
online
courses
can
be
more
cost
effective
with
fewer
materials
required
and
lower
tuition
costs
from
universities
for
non traditional
students
online
courses
also
provide
a
more
flexible
option
for
taking
courses
as
needed
from
any
location
ultimately
the
best
option
for
any
individual
might
depend
on
their
own
individual
needs
the
subject
material
and
their
preferred
learning
style
however
depending
on
the
subject
material
taking
courses
in
a
classroom
setting
can
offer
its
own
unique
and
varied
benefits
that
may
prove
invaluable
in
educational
advancement
one
of
the
potentially
major
advantages
of
finishing
high
school
early
is
gaining
exclusive
monetary
and
educational
opportunities
that
may
be
unavailable
to
students
who
take
the
traditional
four year
timeframe
finishing
early
can
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
gain
real world
experience
and
begin
their
college
career
earlier
some
students
may
be
able
to
start
their
high
school
or
college
studies
at
an
accelerated
pace
providing
an
edge
on
their
competition
however
there
are
some
risks
associated
with
graduating
early
students
may
be
missing
out
on
important
life
experiences
such
as
proms
summer
activities
or
networking
with
other
students
that
can
be
beneficial
afterwards
furthermore
learning
at
an
advanced
pace
may
be
difficult
for
students
who
are
not
incredibly
motivated
or
lack
the
resources
to
do
so
overall
the
four year
traditional
high
school
experience
provides
a
large
range
of
benefits
it
can
provide
a
strong
academic
and
social
foundation
while
also
allowing
students
to
focus
on
self exploration
and
create
memories
that
they
will
cherish
for
years
to
come
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
student
to
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
finishing
high
school
early
and
decide
if
it
is
the
best
option
for
their
academic
and
personal
goals
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
way
people
interact
with
each
other
and
conduct
their
everyday
activities
shopping
for
example
is
no
longer
an
out and about
experience
with
online
stores
shoppers
can
now
purchase
items
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes
the
same
goes
for
movie going
streaming
services
have
made
it
possible
for
people
to
watch
their
favorite
films
on
any
device
anytime
anywhere
finally
technology
has
also
changed
the
way
people
engage
in
social
activities
with
social
media
people
can
now
stay
connected
with
their
friends
and
family
members
regardless
of
where
they
are
in
the
world
technology
has
made
it
easier
for
people
to
stay
connected
and
share
experiences
creating
new
opportunities
for
social
interaction
we
ve
chosen
a
science
experiment
to
complete
as
a
group
and
have
assigned
each
person
a
different
task
based
on
the
experiment
now
we
can
gather
the
supplies
and
materials
we
need
to
get
started
taking
turns
each
of
us
follows
the
instructions
to
complete
the
experiment
once
finished
we
clean
up
the
work
space
and
materials
now
that
the
experiment
is
complete
we
discuss
it
as
a
group
reflecting
on
the
process
and
outcomes
we
explore
and
discuss
different
questions
that
arose
while
doing
the
experiment
and
consider
any
connections
to
the
real
world
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
someone
s
life
it
does
n t
take
much
to
make
a
real
difference
in
someone
s
day
a
simple
gesture
of
kindness
like
a
smile
can
make
even
the
most
difficult
situation
a
little
brighter
if
you
hold
a
door
open
for
someone
they
appreciate
the
extra
effort
and
kindness
these
small
acts
of
kindness
can
also
be
seen
in
larger
behaviors
for
example
spending
time
with
an
elderly
neighbor
donating
clothes
to
a
homeless
shelter
or
volunteering
at
a
food
pantry
doing
these
activities
can
not
only
help
those
in
the
community
but
can
also
be
a
source
of
fulfillment
even
something
as
simple
as
helping
someone
carry
groceries
or
letting
someone
go
ahead
of
you
in
line
can
make
an
impact
everyone
is
busy
and
can
feel
inundated
with
stress
and
responsibilities
so
a
small
act
of
kindness
can
be
a
reminder
that
someone
has
taken
the
time
to
think
of
them
this
gesture
of
kindness
can
help
bring
a
smile
to
someone
s
face
and
make
them
feel
supported
in
conclusion
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
a
big
impact
these
simple
gestures
are
an
easy
way
to
show
consideration
and
appreciation
for
those
around
you
remember
even
a
small
act
of
kindness
can
go
a
long
way
one
potential
pro
of
students
taking
online
classes
from
home
especially
in
is
the
convenience
and
flexibility
it
offers
with
online
classes
students
are
able
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
on
their
own
schedule
without
having
to
adhere
to
set
classroom
times
additionally
virtual
instruction
can
open
up
access
to
a
wider
variety
of
course
offerings
that
may
not
typically
be
available
in
local
schools
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
potential
cons
associated
with
online
learning
especially
in
which
include
a
lack
of
face to face
interaction
and
physical
presence
additionally
there
may
be
an
increased
potential
for
distraction
and
reduced
motivation
for
students
who
are
not
held
accountable
for
attendance
or
class
participation
without
the
physical
presence
of
an
instructor
the
learning
environment
may
not
be
as
engaging
for
students
the
idea
of
always
striving
to
do
something
in
order
to
improve
one
s
life
is
a
widely
accepted
view
that
is
here
to
stay
those
who
do
not
take
action
at
some
point
in
their
lives
and
instead
choose
to
sit
and
wait
for
something
to
happen
are
much
less
likely
to
reach
success
examining
successful
individuals
is
a
great
way
to
illustrate
this
point
for
example
grew
up
with
little
opportunity
and
faced
immense
poverty
growing
up
however
she
pursued
every
opportunity
she
had
and
became
one
of
the
most
successful
individuals
in
the
world
not
only
did
she
become
the
first
african american
billionaire
she
also
created
many
platforms
to
help
empower
women
around
the
world
opposing
this
view
some
may
argue
that
taking
action
is
not
the
sure fire
way
to
reach
success
this
is
however
an
incorrect
view
to
take
if
we
look
back
at
examples
in
history
there
is
a
clear
correlation
between
taking
action
and
reaching
success
furthermore
if
we
look
at
our
own
lives
any
time
we
took
action
we
moved
closer
towards
our
goals
in
school
at
work
or
even
in
sports
we
can
identify
times
when
we
moved
closer
to
success
because
of
action
in
conclusion
the
idea
of
taking
action
in
order
to
reach
success
is
valid
and
it
is
proved
time
and
time
again
by
history
and
our
personal
experiences
sitting
and
waiting
for
something
to
happen
will
almost
never
lead
to
success
rather
taking
action
as
consistently
as
possible
is
much
more
likely
to
bring
us
closer
to
reaching
our
goals
no
matter
where
you
are
in
life
or
what
you
do
failure
and
success
will
always
be
at
your
side
failure
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
and
it
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
pursuit
of
success
when
life
is
mean
and
nasty
and
criticism
pours
in
from
those
around
us
it
is
important
to
remember
one
s
own
self determination
and
self worth
even
when
starting
a
new
job
or
feeling
the
pressure
of
not
having
complete
confidence
failure
can
give
you
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
your
mistakes
and
make
sure
you
do
n t
make
them
again
learning
to
fail
and
getting
back
up
again
is
key
to
growing
and
achieving
success
it
may
seem
insurmountable
at
times
but
failure
can
often
be
the
stepping
stone
to
success
the
relationship
between
failure
and
success
is
one
that
if
handled
correctly
can
lead
to
incredible
accomplishments
famously
declared
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
to
research
and
reflect
on
the
role
failure
plays
in
the
pursuit
of
success
means
we
must
look
to
examples
of
people
who
have
pushed
through
setbacks
and
eventually
achieved
success
for
instance
many
people
have
heard
the
story
of
s
attempts
to
invent
the
light
bulb
despite
failures
he
pushed
on
until
his
attempt
brought
him
success
this
demonstrates
the
importance
of
looking
for
lessons
embedded
in
failures
and
finding
courage
to
keep
working
to
teach
students
the
value
of
failure
in
relation
to
success
educators
should
encourage
students
to
undertake
projects
or
experiments
in
a
low stakes
environment
with
guidance
allow
students
to
take
risks
in
their
learning
process
and
to
not
be
afraid
to
make
mistakes
through
reflection
conversations
and
feedback
educators
can
help
students
gain
insight
and
tap
into
resources
to
try
again
despite
failing
ultimately
it
is
these
moments
of
resilience
and
perseverance
that
will
allow
students
to
come
out
on
top
and
realize
success
curfews
are
an
important
part
of
the
teenage
experience
having
a
curfew
can
provide
a
sense
of
safety
for
adolescents
as
well
as
set
up
good
habits
for
the
future
the
primary
focus
of
a
curfew
is
to
keep
teenagers
safe
as
teenagers
gain
more
freedom
curfews
help
enforce
a
range
of
limits
that
are
necessary
for
their
safety
a
curfew
also
helps
identify
appropriate
times
for
teens
to
come
home
allowing
parents
to
relax
knowing
when
their
children
will
be
home
and
safe
another
reason
for
a
curfew
is
that
it
sets
the
stage
for
developing
responsible
habits
sufficient
sleep
plays
a
vital
role
in
teenagers
growth
and
development
and
setting
a
reasonable
curfew
helps
promote
healthy
sleeping
habits
additionally
having
a
curfew
can
instill
respect
for
authority
and
encourage
teens
to
take
responsibility
for
their
obligations
not
everyone
agrees
that
imposing
a
curfew
is
beneficial
many
people
argue
that
curfews
are
too
restrictive
and
infringe
on
teenagers
freedom
it
is
important
to
consider
these
arguments
when
establishing
a
curfew
for
your
teens
however
with
the
right
amount
of
guidance
and
discussion
most
families
can
work
together
to
create
an
effective
curfew
that
meets
their
needs
in
conclusion
teenage
curfews
provide
essential
safety
promote
healthy
habits
and
encourage
responsibility
although
having
a
curfew
might
not
be
well received
by
some
teenagers
the
long term
outcomes
are
worth
the
initial
conflict
working
in
a
group
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
for
one
having
more
minds
to
work
on
a
particular
task
can
make
the
work
more
effective
than
if
one
person
were
to
work
on
it
alone
working
with
a
team
can
also
help
increase
self confidence
as
there
is
a
sense
of
support
and
encouragement
from
the
other
members
when
tackling
a
challenge
lastly
working
in
a
group
has
the
added
benefit
of
creating
an
environment
where
everyone
can
interact
and
exchange
ideas
openly
rather
than
a
single
person
needing
to
work
in
isolation
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
has
some
advantages
of
its
own
most
notably
one
can
maintain
total
control
and
responsibility
for
a
project
without
having
to
consult
other
people
about
decisions
which
can
be
helpful
for
complex
tasks
additionally
when
working
in
isolation
one
can
focus
intently
on
the
task
without
distractions
from
outside
conversations
this
can
help
improve
the
speed
and
accuracy
of
the
work
in
conclusion
working
in
groups
and
working
alone
both
have
their
own
advantages
so
it
is
important
to
consider
the
specific
task
at
hand
before
deciding
which
approach
is
best
unfortunately
first
impressions
don
t
always
go
well
however
research
shows
that
open
minded
people
and
the
willingness
to
give
second
chances
can
often
help
to
change
a
bad
first
impression
as
an
example
consider
the
story
of
an
american
investor
who
visited
a
foreign
company
with
which
she
was
looking
to
establish
a
business
relationship
during
the
visit
the
investor
mispronounced
one
of
the
company
s
names
which
caused
many
of
the
members
of
the
staff
to
become
offended
despite
the
unfavorable
impression
the
company
s
director
chose
to
show
understanding
for
the
innocent
mistake
and
offered
the
investor
the
benefit
of
a
second
chance
the
director
s
open mindedness
about
the
mispronunciation
signaled
to
the
investor
that
her
careless
error
would
not
interfere
with
the
potential
business
relationship
ultimately
the
investor
and
the
foreign
company
were
able
to
develop
a
long term
successful
partnership
another
example
is
a
young
high achieving
student
who
was
applying
to
college
during
his
initial
interview
the
student
made
several
mistakes
and
created
a
chaotic
atmosphere
not
only
did
the
student
misspell
words
during
his
presentation
but
he
was
not
able
to
recall
important
details
from
his
past
experiences
however
the
interviewer
simply
reminded
the
student
to
relax
and
view
the
exercise
as
an
informal
conversation
from
that
point
on
the
student
was
able
to
loosen
up
and
give
the
interviewer
the
information
and
anecdotes
necessary
to
create
an
accurate
and
impressive
impression
it
is
clear
that
open mindedness
and
second
chances
offer
the
opportunity
to
change
a
bad
first
impression
the
examples
of
the
investor
who
was
able
to
create
a
successful
business
relationship
and
the
student
who
was
given
the
chance
to
improve
his
college
interview
both
demonstrate
the
power
of
a
second
chance
with
the
right
attitude
and
a
little
understanding
many
unfavorable
first
impressions
can
transition
into
favorable
ones
asking
for
advice
can
be
a
great
tool
for
learning
and
making
wiser
decisions
it
can
help
us
avoid
mistakes
and
in
many
circumstances
overturn
mistakes
we
have
already
made
we
have
all
heard
stories
of
people
seeking
counsel
and
going
on
to
make
wise
decisions
some
have
even
gone
on
to
achieve
great
feats
for
example
in
sought
advice
from
a
photojournalist
during
a
challenging
time
and
with
this
advice
she
went
on
to
win
the
for
the
potential
risks
of
not
seeking
advice
can
be
catastrophic
especially
when
facing
tough
times
taking
risks
without
seeking
the
wisdom
of
those
with
more
experience
can
lead
to
disastrous
outcomes
it
is
important
to
remember
that
those
in
our
life
have
been
through
similar
experiences
in
the
past
and
can
give
invaluable
advice
that
would
not
have
been
obtained
otherwise
therefore
never
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
and
seek
the
guidance
of
an
older
person
their
advice
can
bring
perspective
and
direction
for
tough
times
and
help
us
make
better
decisions
the
success
of
a
program
in
a
school
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
student
relationships
teamwork
and
trust
this
is
especially
true
when
it
comes
to
programs

can
be
formed

successful
program

can
lead
to
greater
collaboration
and
success
outside
of

program
in

relationships

in
a
program
can

other
s
unique
skills

drawbacks
associated
with
introducing
an
afterschool
homework
club
into

your

in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
dramatic
shift
in
people
s
perspectives
on
how
to
live
life
more
and
more
people
are
beginning
to
realize
the
importance
of
taking
risks
and
making
their
own
decisions
in
order
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
life
it
is
believed
that
by
taking
risks
and
having
the
courage
to
take
control
of
one
s
own
life
an
individual
will
be
more
likely
to
realize
their
true
potential
and
pursue
a
life
of
happiness
and
fulfillment
additionally
it
is
important
to
remember
that
one
must
learn
to
love
oneself
and
depend
on
themselves
in
order
to
be
truly
happy
with
their
lives
having
the
confidence
to
face
any
challenge
and
take
full
responsibility
for
one
s
own
actions
will
lead
to
a
better
more
sustainable
perspective
on
life
in
personal
or
professional
matters
being
able
to
take
risks
and
effectively
decide
one
s
own
path
is
a
key
element
to
a
successful
life
it
is
clear
that

and
making
sound
decisions
is
an
essential
part
in

a
better
perspective
on
life

oneself
and
learn
to
accept
the
consequences
of
their
actions
by
doing
this
a
person
will
have
more
control
over
their
own
life
and
be
able
to
pursue
a
higher
level
of
happiness
in
a
world
of
conformity
and
judgment
it
can
be
unbelievably
hard
to
simply
be
yourself
throughout
history
from
the
rejection
of
s
scientific
theories
in
the
sixteenth
century
to
the
bullying
of
individuals
in
modern
day
fear
of
the
unknown
has
been
a
prevailing
force
has
often
refused
to
accept
people
with
any
differences
and
those
who
fall
into
the
other
category
are
subjected
to
judgement
and
even
outright
discrimination
at
philosophical
level
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
it
can
be
so
difficult
to
be
yourself
fear
of
the
unknown
has
been
a
strong
human
instinct
since
the
dawn
of
evolution
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
look
past
that
to
welcome
in
change
people
naturally
follow
the
herd
mentality
and
so
those
that
are
different
tend
to
stand
out
there
are
steps
that
individuals
can
take
to
come
to
terms
with
being
themselves
in
a
world
that
is
not
always
accepting
it
is
important
for
any
individual
to
recognize
their
value
and
the
freedom
of
being
who
they
are
as
well
as
this
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
value
of
embracing
differences
and
diversity
to
surround
yourself
with
people
that
value
accept
and
understand
said
differences
is
also
an
important
step
in
achieving
peace
of
mind
when
being
yourself
in
a
non accepting
world
difficulty
of
being
yourself
in
a
world
that
refuses
to
accept
differences
is
a
very
real
issue
though
this
does
not
mean
that
individuals
need
to
give
up
hope
with
the
right
attitude
and
mindset
it
is
possible
to
find
solace
and
strength
to
remain
true
to
oneself
when
debating
the
merits
of
instituting
a
curfew
for
teens
it
s
important
to
look
at
both
the
pros
and
cons
of
such
a
rule
on
the
positive
side
having
a
curfew
can
help
to
ensure
that
teens
are
safe
and
in
a
secure
environment
at
night
restricting
the
potential
to
engage
in
risky
behaviors
such
as
drinking
drug
use
or
being
on
the
streets
with
potential
predators
additionally
a
curfew
could
encourage
more
responsible
spending
on
the
part
of
teens
by
forcing
them
to
stay
home
and
increasing
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
studying
sleeping
and
engaging
in
other
positive
healthy
activities
on
the
other
hand
enforcing
a
curfew
could
have
some
drawbacks
for
instance
it
could
stifle
creativity
and
socializing
amongst
teens
as
they
may
feel
more
confined
and
restricted
to
their
homes
imposing
a
curfew
could
also
undermine
parent child
relationships
leading
to
an
increased
feeling
of
mistrust
on
both
sides
furthermore
a
curfew
rule
could
be
difficult
to
enforce
as
police
officers
would
have
to
take
time
away
from
more
important
duties
such
as
patrolling
the
streets
and
responding
to
emergencies
ultimately
it
is
important
to
evaluate
both
the
pros
and
cons
of
implementing
a
curfew
rule
for
teens
before
making
a
decision
although
there
may
be
some
potential
benefit
to
this
policy
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
downsides
and
determine
if
the
pros
outweigh
the
cons
s
famous
quote
a
problem
is
a
chance
to
do
your
best
serves
to
remind
people
that
stumbling
blocks
can
often
be
opportunities
to
put
our
best
efforts
forward
and
rise
to
the
occasion
i
ve
applied
this
lesson
in
a
variety
of
situations
in
terms
of
sports
i
ve
regularly
faced
physical
setbacks
due
to
a
weak
ankle
despite
being
discouraged
at
first
i
ve
taken
s
advice
to
heart
and
worked
extra
hard
on
strengthening
it
to
assure
i
don
t
miss
out
on
any
opportunity
to
compete
this
quote
has
also
inspired
me
to
take
a
hands on
approach
to
tackling
tough
challenges
in
school
for
instance
when
i
struggled
to
memorize
a
math
formula
i
chose
to
focus
on
what
i
needed
to
learn
and
spent
additional
time
on
drilling
the
material
until
i
was
confident
i
had
mastered
it
also
issues
between
family
members
are
difficult
to
resolve
but
i
ve
used
this
philosophy
to
work
through
our
conflicts
with
kindness
and
understanding
for
example
when
there
was
a
disagreement
between
my
brother
and
i
about
how
to
split
the
chores
rather
than
arguing
i
immediately
looked
for
the
most
fitting
solution
that
everyone
could
live
with
and
that
achieved
the
best
outcome
possible
by
analyzing
s
quote
it
s
evident
that
it
instills
a
sense
of
positivity
and
strength
even
when
obstacles
arise
it
reminds
us
to
remain
resilient
and
provides
an
opportunity
to
showcase
our
best
abilities
imagination
has
incredible
power
and
can
often
be
far
more
important
than
knowledge
it
has
the
power
to
innovate
to
create
and
to
improve
take
the
example
of
the
brothers
knowing
the
principles
of
aerodynamic
flight
would
not
have
been
enough
to
make
them
the
first
to
fly
in
a
heavier than air
craft
it
was
their
imagination
their
belief
that
they
could
create
something
that
had
never
been
created
before
that
allowed
them
to
succeed
the
same
is
true
today
having
knowledge
is
important
but
it
s
our
imagination
that
often
makes
the
biggest
difference
projects
that
challenge
us
to
think
about
different
ways
of
doing
something
and
to
come
up
with
innovative
approaches
often
benefit
more
from
imaginative
thinking
than
from
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
subject
matter
by
applying
our
imaginations
we
can
take
something
that
might
seem
impossible
and
make
it
a
reality
imagination
can
also
be
a
highly
useful
tool
in
our
work
and
personal
lives
it
can
help
us
generate
ideas
for
dealing
with
problems
for
creating
new
avenues
of
income
and
for
finding
more
efficient
and
effective
ways
of
doing
almost
anything
we
undertake
it
can
also
be
used
to
help
us
work
though
challenging
feelings
such
as
fear
anxiety
and
even
depression
by
using
imaginative
exercises
we
can
work
through
our
emotions
in
a
healthy
constructive
way
imagination
can
be
invaluable
when
combined
with
knowledge
but
it
can
also
be
an
indispensable
tool
on
its
own
it
can
help
us
dream
up
new
possibilities
forge
new
pathways
and
lead
us
to
places
we
never
thought
possible
that
is
why
imagination
can
often
be
more
important
than
knowledge
the
debate
of
whether
or
not
to
allow
students
to
bring
their
phones
to
school
and
use
them
during
lunch
periods
and
other
free
times
has
been
an
ongoing
one
on
one
side
of
the
argument
proponents
believe
that
smartphones
can
provide
students
with
an
unprecedented
level
of
connectivity
enabling
them
to
stay
in
touch
with
friends
research
school
topics
and
access
other
important
information
furthermore
phones
can
provide
essential
tools
to
students
such
as
calendars
note taking
apps
and
calculators
on
the
other
hand
detractors
believe
that
enabling
students
to
use
phones
during
lunch
periods
and
free
times
can
be
a
distraction
and
counter
to
proper
learning
parents
might
worry
that
phone
usage
may
lead
to
increased
cyberbullying
or
exposure
to
inappropriate
content
ultimately
if
smartphones
are
to
be
allowed
in
school
strict
guidelines
should
be
put
into
place
should
consider
instituting
rules
to
ensure
that
phones
are
not
used
during
class
as
the
primary
focus
should
always
be
on
learning
additionally
schools
should
ensure
that
students
are
aware
of
the
risks
and
consequences
associated
with
phone
usage
so
that
students
can
make
more
informed
decisions
having
a
positive
mindset
and
developing
strategies
for
how
to
cope
with
potential
failures
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
one
s
response
to
difficult
times
in
order
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
when
things
do
n t
go
as
planned
such
as
getting
a
bad
grade
on
a
test
or
quiz
practicing
positive
self talk
can
be
particularly
beneficial
positive
self talk
can
help
reframe
challenging
situations
providing
a
more
realistic
and
balanced
perspective
and
giving
individuals
the
encouragement
and
motivation
needed
to
cope
with
any
challenges
they
may
face
additionally
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
more
productive
problem solving
increased
motivation
and
improved
overall
mental
wellbeing
it
is
important
to
remember
that
mistakes
and
failures
can
lead
to
growth
and
having
a
positive
outlook
is
the
key
to
navigating
difficult
times
proponents
of
accelerated
high
school
education
argue
that
graduating
in
three
years
offers
several
benefits
for
one
it
allows
students
to
save
the
cost
of
a
year
of
tuition
fees
and
other
expenses
associated
with
traditional
four year
programs
it
also
helps
reduce
the
amount
of
time
necessary
to
complete
a
college
education
graduating
early
puts
students
ahead
of
the
competition
when
it
comes
to
landing
a
job
however
there
are
several
drawbacks
to
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
pursuing
accelerated
studies
often
means
that
students
must
compromise
their
social
lives
and
friendships
they
also
can
not
experience
the
same
milestones
that
their
peers
may
enjoy
such
as
proms
and
other
school
events
additionally
there
can
also
be
a
great
deal
of
stress
and
pressure
associated
with
accelerated
studies
students
may
find
that
they
are
unable
to
juggle
their
course
load
as
well
as
extracurricular
activities
or
time
for
leisure
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
individual
student
to
decide
whether
attending
an
accelerated
high
school
program
and
graduating
in
three
years
is
worth
the
emotional
physical
and
mental
strain
to
make
an
informed
decision
i
suggest
consulting
with
guidance
counselors
mentors
and
other
experienced
individuals
who
have
first hand
knowledge
of
accelerated
education
i
also
recommend
researching
case
studies
and
personal
experiences
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
positive
and
negative
outcomes
associated
with
such
a
path
preliminary
research
suggests
that
the
introduction
of
a
four day
work
week
could
bring
numerous
benefits
to
businesses
and
schools
from
an
environmental
standpoint
ditching
a
traditional
five day
work
week
could
reduce
carbon
emissions
as
commuting
and
using
electricity
would
be
reduced
in
terms
of
educational
impact
research
indicates
that
school
districts
that
have
adopted
a
shorter
school
week
are
seeing
improved
student
performance
and
attendance
on
the
economic
side
a
four day
week
can
reduce
costs
associated
with
utilities
payroll
and
supplies
in
addition
it
can
increase
employee
morale
and
productivity
and
reduce
employee
stress
levels
some
businesses
and
schools
throughout
the
world
have
already
implemented
the
four day
work
week
and
are
currently
reaping
its
benefits
for
example
a
school
in
switched
to
a
four day
week
and
reported
improved
test
scores
as
well
as
greater
staff
satisfaction
and
engagement
similarly
a
business
in
switched
to
a
four day
week
and
reported
average
gains
in
employee
productivity
between
percent
a
four day
work
week
holds
significant
potential
for
both
businesses
and
schools
in
terms
of
economics
the
environment
and
performance
after
hearing
the
stories
of
successful
people
who
have
made
their
dreams
come
true
i
began
to
understand
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
clear
vision
of
what
i
want
to
achieve
and
how
i
am
going
to
achieve
it
i
also
learned
how
important
it
is
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
every
decision
i
make
and
to
trust
my
own
instinct
rather
than
blindly
following
what
others
say
to
get
the
most
out
of
my
life
experiences
i
have
decided
to
focus
on
collecting
as
much
experience
as
i
can
so
that
i
can
use
it
to
inform
my
decisions
finally
throughout
this
entire
journey
i
will
stay
confident
in
my
ability
to
make
decisions
and
stay
true
to
my
values
as
humans
we
are
constantly
evaluating
learning
and
growing
through
our
experiences
it
can
be
said
that
our
past
experiences
shape
our
future
first
impressions
either
through
how
we
prepare
ourselves
or
how
we
interpret
the
reactions
and
feelings
of
those
around
us
this
can
be
crucial
when
it
comes
to
embarrassing
situations
that
can
happen
in
social
settings
every
individual
has
their
own
set
of
experiences
that
shape
them
and
therefore
the
ability
to
better
prepare
for
these
situations
will
depend
on
acknowledging
our
past
experiences
and
using
them
to
form
our
future
actions
taking
lessons
from
the
past
situations
and
feeling
comfortable
enough
to
properly
apply
them
can
be
the
difference
between
being
more
confident
and
successful
in
our
first
impressions
or
perpetuating
embarrassing
and
sometimes
embarrassing
situations
the
goal
then
to
is
to
learn
from
past
experiences
in
order
to
gain
the
necessary
skills
to
successfully
stand
up
to
and
prepare
for
potential
embarrassing
situations
when
we
approach
life
with
a
positive
attitude
we
are
better
equipped
with
the
tools
necessary
to
take
on
the
challenges
ahead
and
to
create
a
life
full
of
happiness
and
success
for
instance
when
faced
with
an
obstacle
a
positive
outlook
allows
us
to
approach
the
situation
with
a
clear
head
to
brainstorm
creative
solutions
and
to
access
our
problem solving
skills
positive
thinking
also
helps
us
to
minimize
negative
fallouts
and
to
focus
on
the
positive
aspects
of
the
situation
furthermore
being
a
positive
person
allows
us
to
foster
healthier
relationships
with
the
people
around
us
it
enables
us
to
maintain
a
more
positive
outlook
on
life
even
in
difficult
times
and
it
allows
us
to
face
the
complexities
of
life
with
a
sense
of
grace
and
optimism
positive
thinking
also
helps
us
to
better
appreciate
life
s
joys
moments
of
triumph
and
to
remain
hopeful
for
the
future
finally
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
to
access
higher
emotions
and
to
lead
more
meaningful
lives
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
can
help
us
to
view
our
successes
and
trials
as
stepping
stones
towards
our
goals
rather
than
viewing
them
as
setbacks
or
sources
of
hopelessness
a
positive
attitude
enables
us
to
recognize
our
accomplishments
and
bask
in
the
joys
of
a
job
well
done
in
short
having
a
positive
attitude
is
a
key
component
in
creating
a
life
filled
with
success
joy
and
high
emotions
by
taking
on
each
challenge
with
grace
and
an
open
mind
we
can
create
a
better
future
for
ourselves
and
for
those
around
us
first
impressions
can
be
a
powerful
force
in
shaping
the
way
teenagers
in
high
school
think
of
themselves
a
single
comment
or
facial
expression
made
by
someone
they
want
to
impress
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
their
self confidence
and
self worth
this
can
lead
to
insecurities
feelings
of
inadequacy
and
distaste
for
their
own
strengths
and
abilities
it
can
also
cause
teenagers
to
miss
out
on
opportunities
that
could
have
otherwise
proved
beneficial
if
a
student
has
already
made
a
poor
first
impression
they
may
not
even
bother
to
apply
for
a
job
or
school
program
because
they
are
convinced
that
no
one
would
give
them
a
chance
this
can
create
a
cycle
of
doubt
and
negativity
in
which
teenagers
are
unable
to
escape
from
their
self imposed
mental
prison
phones
have
the
potential
to
be
powerful
learning
tools
in
the
classroom
on
one
hand
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
could
benefit
learning
by
providing
access
to
a
range
of
educational
apps
and
online
resources
these
could
be
used
to
facilitate
real time
collaboration
between
students
to
aid
in
research
or
to
provide
reference
tools
such
as
online
dictionaries
and
calculators
on
the
other
hand
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
has
potential
risks
including
the
possibility
of
students
becoming
distracted
from
the
lesson
or
using
the
devices
to
cheat
on
tests
and
assignments
even
though
cell
phones
can
be
powerful
learning
tools
providing
access
to
a
range
of
educational
resources
it
is
important
to
examine
the
potential
impact
of
allowing
students
to
use
them
in
the
classroom
on
their
learning
for
example
if
a
student
frequently
uses
their
cell
phone
during
class
they
may
miss
important
information
or
become
distracted
during
lecture
students
might
use
their
cell
phones
to
access
inappropriate
content
such
as
games
messages
or
memes
ultimately
it
is
important
to
carefully
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
allowing
students
to
use
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
before
making
any
decisions
as
well
as
provide
regulations
and
guidelines
to
ensure
that
student
usage
is
being
monitored
in
an
appropriate
manner
in
life
it
is
important
to
make
decisions
that
will
best
benefit
yourself
and
your
future
often
people
rely
on
the
advice
of
experts
to
make
decisions
that
may
be
in
their
best
interests
it
is
important
to
understand
that
there
is
no
one size fits all
answer
to
most
decisions
and
that
what
works
for
one
person
is
not
necessarily
the
best
option
for
another
when
making
decisions
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
the
choices
being
made
ultimately
reflect
our
individual
values
and
desires
seeking
the
advice
of
others
including
experts
can
be
beneficial
but
personal
autonomy
should
be
the
primary
factor
in
decision making
often
people
lack
the
courage
to
stand
up
for
themselves
and
make
their
own
decisions
this
can
lead
to
feelings
of
regret
down
the
line
and
a
lack
of
confidence
in
one
s
ability
to
make
decisions
independently
making
decisions
without
relying
on
the
advice
of
experts
can
be
intimidating
but
it
also
represents
a
chance
for
personal
growth
and
increases
in
self esteem
people
should
be
encouraged
to
question
the
advice
they
receive
and
weigh
the
potential
outcomes
of
their
decisions
before
deciding
which
action
to
take
this
is
an
important
exercise
in
self awareness
which
will
aid
in
making
informed
decisions
that
best
reflect
individual
values
and
desires
in
conclusion
relying
too
heavily
on
expert
advice
when
making
decisions
can
be
a
dangerous
thing
people
should
instead
strive
to
make
decisions
that
best
reflect
their
own
individual
goals
and
values
this
is
an
important
life
skill
that
can
lead
to
increased
confidence
as
well
as
greater
autonomy
and
satisfaction
in
the
choices
being
made
being
true
to
yourself
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
actions
you
can
take
in
life
no
matter
what
society
tells
you
having
faith
in
yourself
and
believing
in
the
power
of
your
dreams
is
essential
if
you
want
to
succeed
and
reach
your
goals
having
trust
in
your
own
abilities
and
striving
for
what
you
believe
in
is
essential
for
inner
peace
and
real
success
the
importance
of
trusting
yourself
is
further
highlighted
when
we
consider
what
happens
when
we
do
n t
if
you
succumb
to
the
pressure
of
following
the
standards
set
by
society
you
run
the
risk
of
changing
yourself
so
drastically
that
you
no
longer
recognize
yourself
when
this
happens
it
can
be
difficult
to
find
your
way
back
to
the
person
you
were
meant
to
be
trying
to
live
according
to
societal
expectations
can
be
exhausting
and
draining
you
find
yourself
constantly
at
war
with
yourself
struggling
to
reconcile
the
person
society
wants
you
to
be
with
the
person
you
know
you
are
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
are
the
only
one
who
truly
knows
what
is
right
for
you
it
is
therefore
essential
to
understand
and
have
faith
in
yourself
and
believe
that
you
can
achieve
anything
you
put
your
mind
to
when
you
have
the
courage
to
trust
in
your
own
dreams
aspirations
and
goals
you
open
up
a
world
of
opportunities
believing
in
yourself
can
open
the
door
to
a
life
of
real
success
and
inner
peace
it
can
be
difficult
to
remain
true
to
oneself
in
a
world
where
there
are
constant
forces
trying
to
make
you
something
else
media
magazines
television
and
other
modern
forms
of
communication
reinforce
ideas
about
who
we
should
be
telling
us
one
thing
yet
pressuring
us
to
act
another
way
it
can
be
easy
to
fall
into
the
trap
of
believing
that
we
must
fit
these
outside
expectations
in
order
to
be
accepted
however
it
is
important
to
know
that
no
one
should
have
to
change
who
they
are
to
please
someone
else
being
yourself
is
essential
for
good
mental
health
it
means
having
the
courage
to
stand
up
for
what
you
believe
in
and
to
be
yourself
even
when
it
s
hard
there
is
great
benefit
in
building
self confidence
and
standing
up
for
ourselves
and
it
can
come
with
overcoming
the
difficulties
of
being
ourselves
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
change
us
there
are
many
ways
to
achieve
the
important
goal
of
remaining
true
to
oneself
one
of
the
best
things
a
person
can
do
is
to
surround
themselves
with
supportive
people
who
will
accept
them
for
who
they
are
an
individual
should
also
be
mindful
of
the
thoughts
they
have
and
how
they
perceive
others
being
kind
and
respectful
of
different
backgrounds
and
beliefs
can
help
a
person
feel
connected
to
others
most
importantly
it
is
essential
to
be
mindful
of
one
s
thought
process
so
they
can
focus
on
self love
and
acceptance
instead
of
internalizing
any
unwanted
pressures
from
society
by
maintaining
an
attitude
of
self love
and
acceptance
one
can
develop
the
strength
to
be
themselves
even
in
the
face
of
other
people
s
opinions
ultimately
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
value
of
being
yourself
and
the
benefits
it
will
bring
there
is
great
strength
and
courage
in
being
true
to
oneself
and
overcoming
the
pressures
of
society
i
m
ready
to
start
planning
for
a
successful
school
year
and
my
goals
are
clear
i
want
to
learn
excel
academically
and
achieve
greatness
my
first
goal
for
the
school
year
is
to
become
an
honor
roll
student
to
help
me
reach
this
goal
i
need
to
create
a
plan
of
action
that
i
can
stick
to
i
ve
been
inspired
by
s
statement
to
know
even
one
life
has
breathed
easier
because
you
have
lived
this
is
to
have
succeeded
it
serves
as
a
reminder
for
me

and
growth
additionally
my

challenging
course

i
m
inspired
by
her
dedication
and

and

the
same
commitment
and
focus
by

clear
goals
and
diligently

confident
i
can
achieve
a
successful
school
year
our
character
is
not
simply
predetermined
by
factors
beyond
our
control
instead
it
is
the
result
of
a
combination
of
both
our
own
choices
and
influences
from
beyond
our
control
for
instance
we
may
be
born
into
a
particular
set
of
family
circumstances
that
shape
our
decisions
and
beliefs
and
these
can
have
a
strong
impact
on
our
behavior
and
attitude
at
the
same
time
we
have
the
capacity
to
choose
our
own
path
and
shape
our
own
character
through
a
combination
of
self determination
and
free
will
for
example
we
may
choose
to
pull
away
from
negative
influences
or
make
a
conscious
effort
to
cultivate
our
own
strengths
and
passions
ultimately
it
is
a
combination
of
our
own
decisions
and
influences
that
forms
our
character
first
impressions
are
often
seen
as
set
in
stone
but
in
reality
they
can
be
changed
over
time
people
frequently
jump
to
conclusions
without
getting
to
know
an
individual
something
we
need
to
work
to
break
away
from
as
each
person
may
have
a
unique
story
to
tell
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
all
have
the
potential
to
change
our
image
in
the
eyes
of
others
one
example
of
how
first
impressions
can
be
changed
is
seen
between
long term
co workers
although
they
may
initially
form
a
certain
opinion
of
one
another
this
image
can
become
more
positive
over
time
as
they
get
to
know
each
other
this
occurs
naturally
as
the
conversations
become
more
involved
and
there
is
an
increased
understanding
of
each
individual
s
ideas
strengths
and
values
another
example
of
first
impressions
changing
is
reflected
in
friendship
circles
initially
one
may
not
think
somebody
is
interesting
or
suitable
to
become
a
friend
but
after
conversing
and
speaking
with
them
one
may
become
increasingly
drawn
to
them
and
so
the
opinion
is
altered
the
ability
to
change
one
s
initial
image
is
something
that
needs
to
be
appreciated
more
this
does
not
mean
people
should
be
afraid
to
judge
somebody
at
first
but
just
that
we
should
all
try
to
dig
deeper
and
get
to
know
one
another
on
a
deeper
level
before
we
make
our
final
judgment
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
flexibility
and
an
open
mind
and
to
let
someone
s
personality
come
through
before
forming
a
lasting
opinion
the
debate
over
whether
school
hours
should
be
reduced
from
a
full
to
a
half
day
has
been
a
long standing
one
supporters
of
reducing
the
school
day
argue
that
it
could
reduce
student
stress
levels
give
students
more
time
to
focus
on
household
responsibilities
and
create
a
more
level
playing
field
among
different
schools
on
the
other
hand
opponents
point
out
that
reducing
the
school
day
could
mean
a
reduction
in
the
quality
of
education
potentially
leading
to
lower
test
scores
and
a
lack
of
preparedness
for
college
they
argue
that
all
students
should
be
held
to
the
same
standard
when
it
comes
to
their
education
ultimately
the
decision
about
whether
or
not
schools
should
reduce
the
end
of
the
school
day
to
half
time
needs
to
be
made
on
a
case by case
basis
from
one
school
to
another
factors
like
educational
quality
student
stress
levels
and
household
responsibilities
need
to
be
taken
into
consideration
it
could
be
argued
that
depending
on
the
context
the
benefits
of
reducing
the
school
day
might
outweigh
the
potential
drawbacks
thus
while
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
reduce
the
school
day
is
complex
and
merit
careful
consideration
it
is
not
an
issue
that
should
be
overlooked
with
the
right
combination
of
factors
reducing
the
school
day
could
be
an
effective
solution
that
benefits
both
students
and
teachers
alike
as
high
school
students
consider
graduating
early
by
taking
advantage
of
a
program
that
offers
them
the
opportunity
to
complete
their
studies
in
three
years
instead
of
four
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
upsides
and
downsides
and
foremost
a
student
s
individual
academic
requirements
must
be
taken
into
consideration
since
obtaining
credits
to
graduate
on
time
is
a
priority
graduating
early
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
building
a
student
s
self confidence
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
elective
courses
are
often
invaluable
due
to
the
breadth
of
knowledge
and
experiences
they
provide
finally
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
how
graduating
early
can
affect
a
student
s
opportunities
in
the
future
while
those
graduating
on
time
may
have
significantly
more
options
those
who
graduate
early
may
face
the
challenge
of
having
to
prove
the
depth
of
their
knowledge
and
skills
despite
having
a
shorter term
education
it
is
crucial
to
consider
all
angles
when
considering
graduating
early
and
ensure
that
informed
decisions
are
made
seeking
out
multiple
opinions
when
making
a
choice
can
be
extremely
beneficial
by
obtaining
opinions
from
a
variety
of
people
we
can
have
a
more
complete
understanding
of
the
pros
and
cons
of
any
given
decision
for
example
when
it
comes
to
making
a
major
life
decision
such
as
where
to
go
to
college
or
what
career
path
to
pursue
having
several
perspectives
can
help
an
individual
make
the
best
informed
decision
for
themselves
on
the
other
hand
depending
on
the
advice
of
only
one
person
may
not
be
as
helpful
because
they
may
not
be
aware
of
all
the
facts
and
implications
involved
they
may
also
have
their
own
preconceived
biases
and
interests
that
could
influence
their
opinion
how
do
we
find
someone
with
reliable
advice
it
can
be
useful
to
look
for
individuals
who
have
walked
the
same
path
as
you
or
have
expertise
in
the
domain
you
are
seeking
advice
from
this
ensures
that
the
advice
you
get
is
based
on
first hand
experience
and
knowledge
additionally
it
can
be
beneficial
to
talk
to
multiple
people
as
different
people
have
different
points
of
view
which
can
give
you
a
more
comprehensive
outlook
finally
it
is
also
important
to
use
your
own
judgement
when
it
comes
to
weighing
the
different
opinions
as
each
individual
s
values
experiences
and
goals
are
unique
to
them
and
you
may
not
agree
with
every
opinion
in
conclusion
seeking
out
multiple
opinions
can
be
extremely
beneficial
especially
for
major
decisions
asking
advice
from
an
informed
and
experienced
individual
is
key
however
it
is
also
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
every
individual
has
their
own
perspectives
biases
and
interests
that
can
influence
their
opinion
furthermore
it
is
essential
to
use
your
own
judgement
when
making
the
final
decision
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
working
either
in
a
group
or
alone
exist
and
should
be
considered
when
deciding
on
collaborative
efforts
working
in
a
group
provides
the
potential
for
enhanced
creativity
and
the
synergy
of
multiple
minds
focused
on
the
same
task
this
can
result
in
improved
accuracy
insight
and
production
working
in
a
group
is
often
more
enjoyable
and
provides
a
sense
of
camaraderie
between
the
members
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
offers
the
individual
the
ability
to
focus
and
attempt
tasks
methodically
while
benefiting
from
their
own
unique
perspective
or
skill
set
working
alone
may
also
be
better
for
achieving
more
sensitive
or
private
goals
ultimately
the
decision
on
if
one
should
work
in
a
group
or
alone
must
be
considered
carefully
and
will
depend
on
the
specific
project
desired
outcome
and
unique
situation
when
it
comes
to
succeeding
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
essential
ingredient
it
s
often
said
that
the
most
successful
individuals
are
those
who
have
a
never
quit
attitude
believing
that
anything
can
be
achieved
with
hard
work
and
dedication
i
know
this
to
be
true
because
i
have
seen
it
firsthand
in
my
own
life
and
the
lives
of
those
around
me
for
example
one
of
my
best
friends
always
approaches
life
with
a
can do
attitude
no
matter
the
situation
he
firmly
believes
that
things
will
always
work
out
in
the
end
and
this
attitude
has
served
him
well
in
his
academic
and
professional
pursuits
he
s
accomplished
more
in
his
short
time
on
earth
than
i
ever
thought
possible
given
the
circumstances
he
has
faced
and
i
believe
this
is
directly
attributable
to
his
unshakeable
optimism
others
may
argue
that
having
a
positive
attitude
is
not
necessarily
a
guarantee
of
success
while
it
s
true
that
having
an
optimistic
outlook
can
lay
a
foundation
for
success
it
needs
to
be
balanced
with
tangible
action
towards
the
goal
after
all
having
a
positive
attitude
does
not
replace
the
need
for
hard
work
and
dedication
additionally
there
are
numerous
external
factors
from
economic
systems
to
socio cultural
contexts
that
shape
success
or
failure
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
believe
that
having
an
optimistic
attitude
is
essential
to
seeing
success
but
it
s
no
substitution
for
hard
work
and
perseverance
it
is
this
combination
that
can
bring
about
the
most
desirable
outcome
and
should
be
the
foundation
of
anyone
s
approach
to
life
after
taking
time
to
research
on
methods
to
become
more
decisive
i
created
a
list
of
possible
solutions
to
practice
i
practiced
developing
conviction
in
my
decisions
by
removing
doubts
and
any
second
guessing
secondly
i
challenged
myself
to
become
more
confident
and
learned
to
identify
moments
of
hesitation
and
push
through
them
lastly
i
was
conscious
of
my
risk taking
abilities
by
self evaluating
and
addressing
any
underlying
fear
by
pushing
myself
to
practice
each
one
of
these
solutions
i
felt
the
impact
of
it
on
my
decision
making
process
i
gradually
felt
more
assured
in
my
choices
as
i
realized
that
i
was
propelling
myself
to
become
more
decisive
while
i
still
struggle
at
times
i
can
feel
the
difference
in
my
decision
making
ability
since
i
began
practicing
these
solutions
overall
i
m
thankful
for
these
methods
as
they
have
helped
me
become
more
decisive
research
has
shown
that
having
an
older
student
assist
in
teaching
a
younger
student
provides
numerous
benefits
the
knowledge
and
experience
the
older
student
has
to
offer
can
help
the
younger
one
gain
a
better
understanding
of
their
subject
material
as
an
older
student
the
younger
student
can
gain
insight
into
what
it
will
take
to
be
successful
in
their
studies
as
they
prepare
for
life
beyond
school
additionally
the
older
student
can
provide
help
with
homework
allowing
the
younger
student
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
the
material
and
develop
stronger
study
skills
over
time
by
working
with
an
older
student
the
younger
student
can
benefit
from
a
higher
level
of
intelligence
better
preparation
for
the
future
and
improved
efficiency
with
their
schoolwork
believed
in
the
idea
that
hard
work
and
dedication
were
essential
if
someone
wanted
to
achieve
success
he
noted
that
honesty
is
the
first
chapter
in
the
book
of
wisdom
which
means
that
without
hard
work
and
determination
success
is
impossible
technology
has
made
things
easier
and
more
enjoyable
but
it
has
also
brought
with
it
the
tendency
to
become
inactive
and
unproductive
staying
motivated
and
committed
to
hard
work
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
success
in
the
face
of
ever changing
technology
for
example
one
of
the
founding
fathers
of
the
states
found
success
by
pushing
himself
to
stay
active
and
hard working
as
he
once
said
an
investment
in
knowledge
pays
the
best
interest
which
emphasizes
the
importance
of
learning
and
pushing
yourself
in
order
to
reach
success
similarly
a
well known
industrialist
found
success
in
the
steel
industry
because
of
his
commitment
to
hard
work
he
also
preached
the
importance
of
continual
learning
and
improvement
in
order
to
succeed
both
and
were
successful
due
to
their
dedication
to
hard
work
and
passion
for
learning
in
this
way
they
exemplify
the
importance
of
staying
motivated
and
pushing
yourself
with
hard
work
in
order
to
find
success
in
the
end
was
correct
hard
work
and
passion
for
learning
are
the
keys
to
success
technology
can
be
of
assistance
but
only
dedication
and
persistence
can
lead
to
success
we
have
the
power
to
choose
our
own
character
traits
which
gives
us
the
ability
to
decide
how
something
that
happens
to
us
affects
us
for
example
when
faced
with
a
material
loss
we
may
choose
to
face
the
challenge
with
resilience
and
positivity
or
give
up
and
be
consumed
by
the
negative
emotions
when
a
workplace
problem
arises
we
may
respond
with
a
problem solving
attitude
or
remain
stuck
in
the
despair
similarly
we
can
choose
how
we
respond
to
a
situation
where
someone
loses
control
of
their
emotions
we
can
be
understanding
and
patient
or
react
harshly
however
it
can
be
exceptionally
difficult
to
keep
things
from
affect
us
when
they
are
related
to
family
and
other
matters
that
are
deeply
important
to
us
in
these
cases
our
emotions
can
become
overwhelming
and
our
go to
strategies
for
managing
our
feelings
may
fail
to
provide
the
necessary
support
ultimately
it
takes
a
degree
of
strength
and
resilience
to
work
towards
keeping
from
being
overwhelmed
plays
an
essential
role
in
connecting
people
s
different
experiences
and
allowing
them
to
learn
from
one
another
put
it
this
way
in
the
state
of
communication
the
power
which
resides
in
one
mind
becomes
the
property
of
another
in
other
words
it
is
through
the
effect
of
agreement
that
the
thoughts
and
ideas
of
one
person
can
be
understood
and
adopted
by
another
this
can
be
especially
true
when
sharing
different
opinions
and
ideas
by
allowing
ourselves
to
come
to
terms
with
each
other
and
take
into
consideration
the
thoughts
and
ideas
of
others
we
can
become
more
informed
and
better
understand
one
another
when
we
seek
to
defend
our
own
opinions
or
argue
against
someone
else
s
it
can
become
a
barrier
to
finding
common
ground
and
understanding
one
another
in
fact
it
can
be
argued
that
without
agreement
it
would
be
impossible
to
develop
any
sort
of
understanding
without
it
it
would
be
pointless
to
even
try
to
share
ideas
because
there
would
be
no
agreement
on
what
the
truth
actually
is
on
the
other
hand
agreement
helps
us
to
better
comprehend
each
other
s
views
and
allows
us
to
make
more
informed
decisions
it
is
through
agreement
that
we
find
understanding
and
insight
into
different
perspectives
and
ideas
it
allows
us
to
grow
and
gain
knowledge
which
can
lead
to
great
things
plays
a
vital
role
in
human
interaction
as
it
allows
us
to
come
to
terms
with
one
another
and
move
forward
with
our
lives
after
researching
the
city
of
i
was
eager
to
visit
and
explore
all
there
is
to
see
i
stumbled
upon
the
iconic
which
i
quickly
snapped
photos
of
from
every
angle
i
enjoyed
learning
more
about
the
city
by
interacting
with
the
locals
learning
about
their
culture
and
lifestyle
i
felt
a
huge
difference
between
the
culture
and
lifestyle
in
compared
to
the
places
i
was
used
to
and
it
gave
me
a
unique
insight
into
the
local
customs
i
documented
the
whole
process
with
photos
and
videos
throughout
my
trip
to
it
was
an
amazing
experience
and
i
ll
treasure
the
memories
for
a
lifetime
the
prospect
of
implementing
a
four day
school
week
with
ten
hour
days
has
merits
and
drawbacks
that
must
be
considered
from
a
student
attendance
perspective
this
schedule
could
lead
to
increased
absenteeism
as
students
may
need
to
juggle
family
matters
on
their
long
days
off
such
as
childcare
furthermore
this
model
could
prove
overly
taxing
on
students
leading
to
increased
stress
levels
on
the
other
hand
an
extended
school
day
could
enable
students
to
benefit
from
a
more
robust
curriculum
with
longer
periods
for
more
complex
concepts
additionally
this
approach
might
be
an
attractive
option
for
students
who
have
part time
jobs
or
extracurricular
commitments
as
they
would
have
longer
days
off
overall
while
a
four day
school
week
with
ten
hour
days
may
have
some
benefits
they
should
be
balanced
with
its
drawbacks
it
is
important
to
remember
that
while
increased
flexibility
may
be
a
positive
aspect
students
must
be
able
to
cope
with
the
extended
days
and
additional
academic
demands
students
should
be
encouraged
to
use
their
days
off
to
help
manage
their
stress
levels
attend
to
necessary
tasks
and
engage
in
activities
that
promote
mental
and
physical
well being
people
often
seek
outside
guidance
when
making
major
decisions
or
dealing
with
life
s
problems
however
it
is
not
necessary
to
rely
on
expert
advice
for
important
life
matters
every
day
individuals
must
make
decisions
based
on
their
own
feelings
desires
and
experiences
looking
to
experts
for
direction
can
be
beneficial
for
seeking
more
information
or
understanding
a
complex
topic
but
it
should
not
take
away
from
the
individual
s
right
to
make
their
own
informed
decisions
rather
than
turning
to
outside
advice
people
should
trust
their
own
intuition
some
of
the
most
important
lessons
learned
throughout
life
come
from
the
individual
s
own
judgments
and
decisions
this
can
be
a
difficult
concept
to
embrace
especially
when
considering
major
changes
in
life
but
ultimately
it
can
lead
to
long term
personal
growth
utilizing
one
s
own
agency
to
make
decisions good
or
bad can
provide
valuable
insight
and
helpful
information
for
the
future
in
addition
depending
on
expert
advice
can
lead
to
a
false
sense
of
security
people
may
take
the
words
of
experts
too
seriously
or
too
literally
causing
them
to
overlook
their
own
individual
values
and
rely
too
heavily
on
another
s
opinion
ultimately
while
expert
advice
can
be
a
useful
tool
it
should
never
be
a
substitute
for
an
individual
s
instinct
and
perspective
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
can
have
a
plethora
of
benefits
such
as
helping
us
to
achieve
our
goals
and
create
more
meaningful
relationships
studies
have
shown
that
those
with
a
positive
outlook
can
have
better
job
performance
increased
motivation
higher
levels
of
productivity
and
even
improved
physical
health
staying
positive
during
difficult
times
is
not
easy
but
taking
a
few
moments
to
appreciate
the
little
things
in
life
and
cultivating
an
attitude
of
gratitude
can
help
to
maintain
a
positive
outlook
on
the
flip
side
being
aware
of
the
impact
your
attitude
has
on
those
around
you
is
also
essential
helping
someone
through
a
rough
patch
consciously
engaging
emotive
language
and
relaying
a
few
words
of
encouragement
can
go
a
long
way
in
uplifting
someone
s
spirits
ultimately
having
a
positive
attitude
all
comes
back
to
having
a
thoughtful
growth oriented
approach
to
life
that
can
make
a
difference
in
your
own
life
and
in
the
lives
of
others
around
you

had
a
tremendous
positive
impact
on
individuals
in
many
aspects
of
life
particularly
in
emergency
transport

has
made
remarkable
improvements
to
the
lives
of
people
in
the
areas
of
emergency
transport
education
and
security
having
a
balanced
lifestyle
of
work
and
leisure
activities
is
paramount
to
a
healthy
fulfilling
life
while
work
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
money
and
provide
for
ourselves
and
our
families
it
must
be
balanced
with
leisure
activities
in
order
to
remain
happy
and
healthy
without
balance
we
can
quickly
become
overwhelmed
and
burnt
out
either
by
dedicating
too
much
of
our
time
to
work
or
vice
versa
taking
on
too
much
work
without
finding
time
for
leisure
activities
leads
to
increased
stress
and
frustration
and
can
even
lead
to
physical
illnesses
such
as
headaches
fatigue
and
a
weakened
immune
system
conversely
if
we
are
not
able
to
motivate
ourselves
to
work
we
will
not
be
able
to
provide
for
ourselves
and
our
families
causing
immense
financial
and
emotional
strain
by
balancing
our
work
with
leisure
activities
we
are
able
to
remain
happy
and
stress free
engaging
in
hobbies
spending
time
with
friends
and
family
or
even
taking
a
walk
around
the
block
can
help
to
relieve
stress
and
create
a
more
positive
outlook
on
life
having
the
financial
security
and
freedom
that
comes
from
being
responsible
and
working
hard
also
increases
feelings
of
contentment
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
having
a
balanced
lifestyle
of
both
work
and
leisure
activities
is
beneficial
to
our
overall
well being
making
the
conscious
effort
to
maintain
a
balance
lifestyle
provides
us
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
security
and
joy
the
idea
of
a
four day
school
week
has
been
met
with
both
praise
and
scrutiny
proponents
argue
that
it
would
offer
a
much
needed
reprieve
for
students
families
and
teachers
alike
suggests
that
students
could
benefit
from
reduced
stress
brought
about
by
eliminating
the
school
week
entirely
on
in
addition
parental
involvement
could
increase
as
families
could
use
as
a
day
for
enrichment
activities
with
their
children
on
the
other
hand
disadvantages
to
a
four day
school
week
could
include
longer
school
days
for
students
and
a
more
complex
schedule
for
teachers
in
addition
student family
relationships
could
be
strained
due
to
longer
hours
away
from
home
and
an
increased
academic
workload
students
may
find
it
difficult
to
maintain
their
focus
for
a
longer
school
day
or
to
stay
motivated
over
a
longer
school
week
the
potential
effects
of
a
four day
school
week
should
be
considered
carefully
before
deciding
whether
to
move
forward
with
such
a
change
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
should
be
thoroughly
evaluated
to
create
an
equitable
outcome
that
addresses
the
needs
of
students
families
and
teachers
alike
throughout
history
great
figures
who
embody
the
spirit
of
never
giving
up
in
pursuit
of
a
dream
have
proven
that
anything
is
possible
no
matter
the
odds
today
stands
as
an
example
of
this
having
overcome
many
political
and
personal
obstacles
to
become
the
of
the
states
as
wrote
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
i
am
determined
to
fag
no
more
to
be
content
with
nothing
short
of
perfection
and
if
i
can
not
get
it
rather
than
be
contented
with
less
i
will
remain
uneducated
this
sentiment
is
as
relevant
today
as
it
was
throughout
s
life
the
courage
and
resilience
demonstrated
by
those
who
are
seeing
their
dreams
come
to
life
often
in
spite
of
challenges
is
nothing
short
of
incredible
while
understandable
to
feel
frustrated
overwhelmed
or
discouraged
it
is
important
to
remember
that
no
one
s
success
comes
without
many
hours
and
great
effort
the
rewards
of
setting
a
goal
and
working
hard
to
achieve
it
are
worth
the
hard
work
and
determination
that
comes
with
it
by
taking
inspiration
from
and
the
other
great
innovators
of
our
time
it
is
possible
to
recognize
the
importance
of
never
giving
up
through
perseverance
and
relentless
effort
it
is
possible
to
make
your
dreams
come
true
no
matter
the
odds
the
difficult
roads
traveled
will
one
day
become
roads
of
gold
and
the
great
successes
of
life
will
be
greater
still
because
of
the
struggles
of
the
past
graduating
early
from
high
school
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
student
s
future
on
the
positive
side
it
can
mean
having
more
time
to
pursue
other
opportunities
such
as
college
or
career
paths
however
there
can
be
some
drawbacks
for
starters
mental
health
is
an
important
factor
to
consider
when
making
this
kind
of
decision
the
fast paced
nature
of
an
early
graduation
may
cause
a
student
to
experience
feelings
of
stress
and
pressure
as
they
are
pushed
out
of
their
comfort
zones
furthermore
access
to
elective
courses
may
be
limited
as
the
student
would
need
to
complete
the
mandatory
courses
to
graduate
before
the
end
of
the
school
year
grades
might
be
affected
by
rushing
through
the
work
making
it
harder
to
secure
a
good
university
placement
ultimately
each
student
must
weigh
up
the
pros
and
cons
of
graduating
early
and
make
sure
that
it
is
the
right
decision
for
their
future
sports
have
the
capacity
to
positively
affect
academic
performance
in
students
that
have
a
grade
average
or
higher
according
to
research
physical
activity
can
lead
to
improved
learning
better
concentration
and
academic
success
in
the
classroom
and
on
tests
when
a
student
participates
in
sports
they
learn
important
life
skills
such
as
communication
teamwork
perseverance
and
integrity
the
effort
time
and
dedication
that
is
required
in
participating
in
sports
encourages
students
to
manage
their
time
wisely
teach
responsibility
prioritize
tasks
and
dedicate
their
attention
to
tasks
in
order
to
achieve
goals
playing
sports
can
also
help
to
reduce
the
risk
of
certain
mental
health related
issues
that
arise
in
adolescence
in
addition
when
students
are
involved
in
sports
they
build
their
self esteem
and
confidence
improving
their
overall
well being
physical
activity
can
increase
the
release
of
endorphins
which
lead
to
improved
moods
and
feelings
of
relaxation
for
these
reasons
students
with
a
grade
average
or
higher
should
be
allowed
to
play
sports
on
both
the
physical
and
psychological
level
playing
sports
has
tremendous
potential
to
contribute
to
student
success
capitalizing
on
this
potential
can
improve
a
student
s
overall
success
in
many
aspects
of
their
life
the
power
of
kindness
should
not
be
underestimated
it
has
countless
positive
effects
and
advantages
that
people
often
overlook
brings
positive
energy
into
any
situation
and
helps
to
build
strong
meaningful
relationships
with
those
around
us
perhaps
the
most
important
benefit
of
all
is
that
it
can
have
a
lasting
positive
impact
on
all
involved
it
s
important
to
understand
that
when
we
show
kindness
to
others
we
can
also
benefit
from
it
as
well
on
the
other
hand
neglecting
to
show
kindness
can
have
significant
negative
consequences
people
who
live
without
kindness
tend
to
feel
alone
anxious
and
like
they
do
n t
belong
leaving
them
with
a
sense
of
unease
and
helplessness
consequently
lack
of
kindness
can
also
lead
to
a
lifetime
of
distrust
and
alienation
from
family
and
friends
for
example
a
small
act
of
kindness
from
a
stranger
can
make
a
person
feel
appreciated
and
noticed
which
can
further
impact
their
lives
in
a
positive
way
on
the
flip
side
a
lack
of
kindness
from
acquaintances
or
family
members
can
leave
someone
feeling
lost
and
without
a
support
system
which
can
have
a
permanent
effect
on
their
view
of
themselves
and
the
world
an
understanding
of
both
the
positive
and
negative
effects
that
kindness
can
have
on
others
is
paramount
to
establishing
meaningful
connections
and
relationships
such
knowledge
can
help
people
use
kindness
as
a
powerful
tool
for
building
bridges
and
achieve
more
harmonious
communities

never

in
your
comfort
zone

give
you
stability
and
consistency
and
therefore
help
you
succeed

has
its
virtues

optimize
your
potential

should
try
different
goals
in

to
develop
creativity
broaden
your
understanding

growing
and
pushing

greater
endeavors

the
way
to
success

in

the
topic
of
healthy
eating
and
nutrition
has
become
increasingly
important
in
recent
years
with
childhood
obesity
on
the
rise
many
schools
are
considering
changing
their
regular
cafeteria
menus
in
order
to
promote
healthier
eating
among
students
implementing
a
new
school
menu
in
the
school
cafeteria
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
should
be
weighed
before
making
any
changes
on
the
positive
side
implementing
a
new
healthier
school
menu
could
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
overall
health
of
the
student
population
by
providing
them
with
healthier
options
additionally
with
the
rising
cost
of
health
care
it
can
be
cheaper
in
the
long
run
since
healthier
eating
habits
can
lead
to
lower
rates
of
chronic
illnesses
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
drawbacks
that
come
with
making
the
switch
to
healthier
eating
implementing
new
meals
could
be
costly
and
time
consuming
as
new
recipes
must
be
created
and
tested
there
is
also
the
risk
of
students
not
enjoying
the
new
meals
and
turning
away
from
the
cafeteria
altogether
some
healthier
meal
options
may
not
be
as
enjoyable
to
the
more
discerning
taste
of
students
and
thus
lead
to
fewer
overall
cafeteria
visitors
in
conclusion
when
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
implementing
a
new
healthier
school
menu
in
the
school
cafeteria
careful
consideration
should
be
taken
although
there
are
advantages
to
promoting
healthier
eating
there
are
also
some
potential
drawbacks
that
must
be
taken
into
account
before
any
changes
are
made
one
of
the
most
widely
discussed
topics
regarding
work life
balance
and
time
management
is
the
question
of
how
much
time
one
should
devote
to
work
one
potential
answer
to
this
question
could
be
working
hours
a
day
for
four
days
per
week
while
that
number
of
hours
can
be
beneficial
in
some
areas
in
life
others
may
suffer
if
this
hours
schedule
is
too
demanding
in
this
essay
i
will
discuss
the
potential
effects
that
working
this
kind
of
schedule
has
on
people
s
school
and
career
life
looking
at
its
impacts
on
health
emotions
personal
life
responsibilities
and
effectiveness
of
learning
the
most
obvious
effect
of
working
hours
a
day
for
four
days
a
week
is
an
increase
in
stress
levels
and
a
decrease
in
one
s
physical
health
this
type
of
workload
can
cause
fatigue
anxiety
irritability
and
an
overall
sense
of
being
overwhelmed
furthermore
it
can
leave
less
time
for
physical
activity
and
eating
healthily
leading
to
an
increased
risk
of
illnesses
when
it
comes
to
emotions
a
hour
workday
could
also
lead
to
feelings
of
anxiety
depression
and
burnout
this
schedule
may
leave
one
feeling
unable
to
fulfill
everyday
tasks
as
well
as
their
responsibilities
in
their
personal
life
spent
away
from
loved
ones
due
to
work
commitments
could
trigger
feelings
of
loneliness
guilt
and
frustration
at
the
same
time
extra
pressures
on
resources
such
as
productivity
energy
and
focus
can
significantly
influence
one
s
ability
to
study
and
work
effectively
many
hours
at
work
could
lead
to
time
lost
on
academic
tasks
reduce
the
opportunities
to
learn
and
cause
difficulty
in
managing
one
s
attention
span
and
increasing
their
effectiveness
in
conclusion
it
s
important
to
consider
the
potential
effects
of
working
hours
a
day
for
four
days
a
week
on
both
school
and
career
life
it
is
essential
to
consider
the
impacts
on
health
emotions
personal
life
responsibilities
and
learning
effectiveness
before
making
a
decision
as
learned
having
a
good
attitude
even
in
the
toughest
of
times
can
make
all
the
difference
he
had
fallen
on
hard
times
with
his
home
in
foreclosure
and
his
health
failing
but
instead
of
wallowing
in
his
misfortune
chose
to
stay
positive
he
kept
his
focus
on
what
he
could
do
to
turn
his
situation
around
and
worked
hard
to
make
it
happen
thanks
to
his
attitude
was
able
to
stay
in
his
home
and
eventually
get
back
on
his
feet
of

having
a
good
attitude
does
n t
just
help
in
difficult
times
it
can
also
make
people
successful
positive
thinking
and
a
good
attitude
can
give
someone
the
strength
and
determination
to
take
on
challenges
leading
to
greater
accomplishments
people
with
good
attitudes
are
also
better
able
to
handle
stress
and
enjoy
life
more
fully
which
can
lead
to
amazing
experiences
and
memories

an
important
quality
to
possess
and
with
it
you
can
positively
impact
your
life
technology
has
had
a
profound
impact
on
our
lives
both
good
and
bad
on
the
one
hand
technology
has
enabled
us
to
become
more
connected
than
ever
before
allowing
us
to
communicate
and
collaborate
with
people
around
the
world
this
has
revolutionized
the
way
businesses
work
helped
create
jobs
and
given
us
access
to
information
at
a
speed
that
was
previously
unimaginable
on
the
other
hand
technology
has
also
created
new
problems
such
as
cyberbullying
identity
theft
and
the
spread
of
misinformation
by
allowing
us
to
access
too
much
information
too
quickly
technology
can
also
lead
to
feelings
of
information
overload
alienation
and
even
depression
in
conclusion
while
there
are
many
positive
impacts
of
technology
on
our
lives
we
must
also
be
aware
of
its
potential
pitfalls
to
counteract
the
potential
negative
impacts
of
technology
it
is
important
to
take
steps
to
ensure
that
technology
is
used
responsibly
and
safely
this
includes
monitoring
the
way
we
use
technology
as
well
as
implementing
safety
measures
to
protect
our
data
and
privacy
with
these
measures
in
place
the
positive
impacts
of
technology
can
hopefully
be
maximized
while
its
potential
harms
are
minimized

be
completed
at

the
merits
of
self determination
versus
trusting
the
advice
of
experts
and
authorities
for
centuries
on
one
hand
there
is
a
strong
argument

not
relinquishing

for
an
outside
authority
to
truly

an
individual
s
situation
or
what
they
value
the
most
on
the
other
hand
great
wisdom
can
come
from
heeding
the
words
of
those
with
expertise
and
experience
who
may

have
a
better
comprehension
of
the
various
variables
at
play
in
a
decision making
process
ultimately
the
solution
lies
somewhere
in
between
seeking
input
and
guidance
is
beneficial
and
empowering
oneself
with
knowledge
and
facts
is
invaluable
but
the
decision
will
always
ultimately
come
down
to
the

of
the
consequences
of

truth
has
long
been
an
important
moral
virtue
with
reverence
for
truth
telling
found
across
many
cultures
and
religions
in
our
everyday
lives
telling
the
truth
generally
results
in
positive
effects
and
a
sense
of
virtue
when
employed
being
honest
with
others
allows
for
an
environment
of
trust
and
respect
to
develop
being
honest
is
the
foundation
for
new
friendships
to
form
as
honesty
is
thought
to
build
a
sense
of
camaraderie

being
honest
can
set
a
good
example
for
others
to
follow
showing

and
integrity
to
others

guidance
in
their

lives

being
honest
in
speech
and
deed
one
can
demonstrate
a
standard
of
moral
behavior
that
will
potentially
have
positive
reverberations
for
those
around
them
on
the
other
hand
being
dishonest
can
have
negative
consequences
while
some
may
be
tempted
to
break
the
truth
in
order
to
get
what
they
want
dishonesty
rarely
pays
off
in
the
long
run
by
not
being
truthful
with
others
the
instance
of
that
untruth
can
erode
trust
in
a
relationship
and
in
an
extreme
circumstance
lead
to
the
near total
collapse
of
that
relationship
lying
or
being
dishonest
also
sets
a
poor
example
for
others
and
can
lead
to
negative
repercussions
finally
when
deciding
whether
or
not
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
important
to
not
speak
too
quickly
without
thinking
speaking
before
one
has
properly
considered
the
potential
consequences
of
their
words
can
lead
to
unfortunate
outcomes
as
words
when
said
can
not
be
un said
thus
it
pays
to
think
first
before
speaking
ultimately
telling
the
truth
is
a
morally
noble
and
important
endeavor
and
has
the
potential
to
lead
to
benefits
such
as
new
relationships
and
demonstrate
integrity
despite
its
temptation
in
certain
situations
being
dishonest
can
have
severe
negative
effects
such
as
damaged
relationships
thus
people
should
be
mindful
of
the
power
of
words
and
think
before
they
speak
in
order
to
make
sure
that
truth
is
properly
represented

its
potential
impact
on
people
s
buying
decisions
after
school
programs
have
become
increasingly
popular
within
the
last
decade
offering
students
the
chance
to
extend
the
content
they
have
learnt
during
the
day
or
to
pursue
a
passion
such
as
creative
writing
or
coding
by
researching
near
my
area
i
have
found
a
plethora
of
after
school
programs
ranging
from
extracurricular
activities
such
as
photography
and
art
to
more
academic
lectures
such
as
coding
and
essay
writing
when
comparing
the
different
programs
there
are
certain
factors
i
had
to
look
at
such
as
their
cost
content
and
duration
i
have
researched
many
success
stories
of
students
who
have
participated
in
after
school
programs
and
have
seen
great
improvement
in
their
academic
work
and
development
of
important
life
skills
such
as
communication
and
problem solving
the
advantages
of
after
school
programs
are
plentiful
they
can
offer
students
the
chance
to
pursue
their
passions
as
well
as
to
expand
beyond
the
content
taught
in
school
which
can
lead
to
better
academic
performance
and
career
advantages
in
the
future
they
can
also
be
beneficial
for
social
development
as
they
provide
the
opportunity
to
make
connections
with
like minded
peers
in
the
same
field
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
disadvantages
to
after
school
programs
such
as
the
possibility
of
overscheduling
it
is
important
to
research
the
different
options
carefully
and
assess
if
the
student
is
likely
to
benefit
from
the
program
before
fully
committing
some
after
school
programs
may
require
additional
costs
such
as
transportation
or
the
purchasing
of
educational
materials
extended
school
days
have
seen
both
positive
and
negative
impacts
on
one
hand
the
day
hour
model
has
been
known
to
reduce
costs
and
provide
more
instructional
time
since
longer
days
are
compressed
into
fewer
days
teachers
also
often
report
more
engagement
amongst
their
students
during
the
longer
days
since
students
have
fewer
distractions
however
there
are
drawbacks
as
well
for
instance
since
students
are
in
school
for
longer
periods
there
is
less
time
to
attend
to
their
physical
mental
and
emotional
needs
parents
can
find
it
more
difficult
to
coordinate
pick
up
and
drop
off
for
their
children
which
can
be
quite
stressful
for
them
given
these
potential
consequences
we
recommend
only
implementing
the
day
hour
model
if
certain
safeguards
are
put
in
place
to
make
sure
that
student
and
parent
needs
are
met
in
exploring
the
concept
of
failure
and
its
role
in
achieving
success
it
is
important
to
consider
s
words
about
staying
enthusiastic
to
handle
failures
as
famously
said
when
you
re
going
through
hell
keep
going
this
serves
to
remind
us
that
failure
is
an
unavoidable
part
of
life
and
the
key
to
achieving
success
is
to
remain
optimistic
even
in
the
face
of
hardship
to
further
illustrate
a
scientist
attempting
to
find
a
successful
result
may
go
through
numerous
experiments
some
successes
and
some
failures
the
key
is
keeping
a
positive
outlook
and
using
the
failures
as
learning
experiences
rather
than
giving
up
this
contrasts
with
feeling
depressed
and
giving
up
after
a
failed
attempt
which
leads
to
a
discouraging
cycle
that
ultimately
prevents
success
one
book
that
addresses
this
topic
in
great
depth
is
the
of
an
indian
by
the
book
uses
anecdotes
from
the
life
of
an
indian
freedom
fighter
as
a
way
to
inspire
readers
to
persevere
even
in
the
face
of
failure
through
this
readers
can
gain
an
understanding
of
the
importance
of
staying
positive
in
order
to
achieve
success
working
alone
i
prefer
to
focus
on
independent
work
as
i
can
avoid
distractions
and
complete
tasks
uninterrupted
working
alone
allows
me
to
make
decisions
quickly
and
complete
work
at
my
own
pace
without
interruption
when
i
work
alone
i
can
think
more
clearly
and
stay
organized
without
needing
to
answer
to
anyone
else
working
with
working
with
groups
can
provide
a
fun
environment
to
exchange
ideas
ask
questions
and
develop
teamwork
skills
projects
allow
everyone
to
contribute
ideas
and
skills
to
the
same
project
in
ways
i
can
not
do
alone
working
with
other
people
motivates
me
to
push
myself
further
and
learn
more
on
one
hand
allowing
students
to
use
their
cellphones
in
the
classroom
could
have
benefits
such
as
allowing
them
to
easily
look
up
information
relevant
to
the
lesson
and
permitting
quick
communication
between
students
however
this
could
also
be
a
significant
distraction
particularly
if
the
instructor
does
not
have
any
ground
rules
or
restrictions
surrounding
the
use
of
cellphones
in
the
classroom
it
s
also
possible
that
students
could
access
materials
or
content
that
could
be
deemed
inappropriate
or
potentially
distracting
for
the
entire
class
it
is
important
to
carefully
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
allowing
students
to
use
their
cellphones
in
the
classroom
before
making
any
definitive
decisions
many
argue
that
longer
summer
vacations
would
be
beneficial
to
children
and
teenagers
as
it
would
provide
them
with
more
time
to
relax
and
enjoy
themselves
this
would
be
especially
useful
during
times
of
high
stress
such
as
final
exams
when
students
need
to
find
ways
to
de stress
from
their
rigorous
studies
additionally
a
longer
summer
vacation
could
provide
more
opportunity
for
learning
through
activities
such
as
volunteer
work
internships
or
travel
experiences
that
might
not
be
available
during
the
school
year
however
opponents
of
longer
summer
vacations
suggest
that
additional
days
away
from
school
could
lead
to
a
decline
in
academic
performance
as
students
would
be
away
from
their
learning
environment
for
a
prolonged
period
it
could
be
difficult
for
them
to
stay
on
track
with
their
studies
and
apply
new
skills
in
a
timely
fashion
additionally
such
a
decrease
in
structure
and
routine
could
be
damaging
to
children
s
development
and
intense
summer
courses
may
be
the
only
solution
to
catch
up
after
a
longer
absence
from
the
classroom
ultimately
whether
a
longer
or
shorter
summer
vacation
is
preferable
depends
on
a
variety
of
factors
at
the
end
of
the
day
students
need
to
find
a
balance
between
taking
a
break
to
rest
and
restoring
their
motivation
for
learning
and
were
determined
to
improve
their
grades
so
they
each
took
different
strategies
worked
to
increase
her
time
management
skills
creating
a
plan
of
action
for
each
school
day
and
sticking
to
it
she
also
identified
her
priorities
helping
her
to
focus
on
the
tasks
that
would
lead
to
success
meanwhile
decided
to
identify
his
strengths
and
weaknesses
enabling
him
to
allocate
his
time
and
energy
in
a
more
efficient
fashion
factors
that
affect
student
success
in
school
revealed
that
academic
goals
need
to
be
balanced
with
creating
a
supportive
environment
building
relationships
with
peers
maintaining
physical
and
mental
health
and
developing
time
management
skills
understanding
how
these
components
can
together
form
a
plan
for
success
is
key
to
the
development
of
good
results
when
examining
and
s
achievements
it
is
clear
that
their
approaches
vary
while
focuses
on
changing
her
habits
to
improve
her
performance
takes
an
analytical
approach
analyzing
his
own
skills
and
weaknesses
in
order
to
improve
his
performance
are
an
important
part
of
success
since
they
provide
support
and
can
help
motivate
us
to
stay
on
track
when
creating
a
plan
for
success
it
is
important
to
have
supportive
individuals
in
one
s
life
as
well
as
establish
boundaries
with
those
who
may
not
contribute
to
a
positive
environment
one
way
to
do
this
is
by
setting
aside
regular
time
to
meet
up
with
these
individuals
and
plan
joint
activities
good
actions
such
as
taking
responsibility
for
one
s
actions
and
committing
to
improvement
will
help
to
encourage
success
also
establishing
meaningful
relationships
with
those
who
can
provide
guidance
and
advice
can
help
support
the
creation
of
a
plan
for
success
finally
discipline
and
perseverance
can
help
to
turn
one
s
goals
into
reality
having
a
positive
attitude
is
fundamental
to
achieving
success
in
life
after
all
a
negative
attitude
can
have
an
adipose
effect
on
our
lives
ultimately
leading
to
an
increase
in
stress
an
inability
to
act
and
a
sense
of
helplessness
a
positive
outlook
however
can
have
a
great
effect
on
how
we
perceive
life
s
challenges
allowing
us
to
see
them
as
opportunities
and
leading
to
increased
creativity
effectiveness
and
purpose
is
a
state
of
mind
and
a
choice
we
make
that
determines
how
we
interpret
and
deal
with
situations
in
life
a
positive
attitude
is
when
we
look
at
life
through
a
lens
of
confidence
optimism
and
hope
we
approach
life
challenges
as
opportunities
to
learn
and
grow
having
a
positive
attitude
can
make
us
feel
motivated
and
allow
us
to
take
risks
rather
than
playing
it
safe
this
kind
of
positive
attitude
makes
us
infinitely
more
resilient
and
prepared
to
overcome
any
obstacles
we
encounter
a
positive
attitude
can
have
a
profoundly
positive
effect
on
our
lives
it
can
make
us
more
productive
and
successful
and
also
help
us
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
others
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
to
see
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
rather
than
a
roadblock
this
in
turn
can
lead
to
more
creative
problem
solving
increased
wellbeing
and
a
more
positive
outlook
on
life
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
important
keys
to
success
in
life
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
to
overcome
obstacles
increase
our
resilience
boost
our
productivity
and
cultivate
meaningful
relationships
with
others
it
is
an
essential
tool
for
navigating
life
s
challenges
and
ultimately
achieving
success
raising
responsible
and
respectful
elementary
school
children
is
an
important
lesson
that
should
be
taught
in
every
classroom
respect
can
come
in
many
forms
whether
it
s
respect
for
elders
peers
teachers
and
most
importantly
yourself
learning
should
be
embraced
in
everything
a
student
does
and
curiosity
should
be
nurtured
learning
allows
for
a
student
s
knowledge
to
expand
beyond
the
school
curriculum
to
help
them
make
informed
decisions
in
their
everyday
lives
lastly
communication
is
a
key
factor
which
not
only
helps
build
relationships
with
peers
but
with
adults
as
well
aids
in
understanding
trust
and
cultural
awareness
it
is
important
for
children
to
understand
the
importance
of
respecting
self
and
others
being
a
life long
learner
and
being
able
to
effectively
communicate
learning
new
skills
is
an
important
part
of
personal
growth
that
can
provide
valuable
life
experiences
examples
of
skills
that
can
be
learned
include
soccer
and
dances
practicing
these
skills
helps
improve
knowledge
and
abilities
patience
is
critical
to
developing
and
honing
skills
for
instance
when
learning
a
dance
it
is
important
to
practice
the
moves
slowly
and
incrementally
breaking
down
the
movements
into
smaller
pieces
and
taking
time
to
master
each
can
help
quickly
build
up
one
s
performance
in
short
patience
practice
and
methodically
breaking
down
a
skill
can
help
anyone
learn
new
skills
and
make
the
most
of
life
student mentor
programs
can
be
extremely
beneficial
for
young
people
not
only
do
they
provide
mentees
with
an
experienced
and
knowledgeable
adult
who
can
offer
guidance
and
help
them
to
gain
confidence
but
it
also
gives
mentors
an
opportunity
to
share
their
wisdom
and
insight
these
programs
provide
a
sense
of
community
and
camaraderie
allowing
mentors
and
mentees
to
engage
and
learn
from
each
other
moreover
student mentor
programs
can
help
students
to
develop
emotional
maturity
and
positive
behavior
in
school
mentors
can
act
as
role
models
while
providing
support
and
resources
to
far
better
create
an
environment
conducive
to
growth
and
development
the
guidance
that
mentors
provide
can
help
to
prepare
young
people
to
become
competent
and
socially
responsible
learners
in
society
thus
student mentor
programs
are
not
only
important
but
they
also
have
a
lasting
impact
on
both
mentors
and
mentees
one
of
the
pros
of
using
video
conferencing
as
an
alternative
to
online
classes
for
students
who
do
not
have
access
to
a
computer
at
home
is
the
ability
to
continue
their
education
with
minimal
disruption
to
their
learning
experiences
conferencing
provides
an
easy
way
for
students
to
participate
in
their
classes
without
the
need
for
a
physical
classroom
allowing
parents
to
spend
less
money
on
associated
costs
such
as
commuting
additionally
this
method
of
teaching
also
helps
to
reduce
the
digital
divide
as
students
can
access
educational
content
from
any
location
with
an
internet
connection
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
few
potential
cons
to
consider
for
example
video
conferencing
can
be
difficult
for
parents
to
monitor
as
it
can
be
hard
to
know
what
is
happening
in
the
class
unless
they
are
actively
monitoring
the
session
some
students
may
struggle
to
keep
up
with
the
pace
of
the
lecture
or
require
additional
guidance
and
assistance
from
the
teacher
during
the
video
conference
lastly
the
technology
itself
can
cause
issues
as
a
poor
internet
connection
can
lead
to
slow
or
unreliable
video
conferencing
which
can
disrupt
the
lesson
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
is
an
increasingly
popular
choice
for
students
who
want
to
save
time
money
and
get
an
early
start
on
their
college
careers
it
can
be
a
great
way
to
start
a
career
or
gain
real world
experience
sooner
one
of
the
main
benefits
of
graduating
early
is
that
students
can
skip
some
of
the
core
courses
they
would
normally
take
saving
them
time
it
can
also
reduce
the
cost
of
college
as
students
would
spend
one
fewer
year
paying
tuition
however
there
are
some
potential
downsides
high
school
students
who
wish
to
graduate
early
may
find
it
difficult
to
balance
their
course
load
with
extracurricular
activities
and
part time
jobs
it
can
also
be
challenging
to
fit
in
the
required
credits
in
three
years
finally
while
some
colleges
may
accept
early
graduates
others
may
not
and
students
may
have
to
adjust
their
plans
if
their
desired
school
does
not
have
policies
in
place
for
early
graduation
in
conclusion
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
can
be
a
great
way
for
students
to
get
a
head
start
on
their
college
education
however
they
must
be
prepared
to
balance
their
studies
with
other
responsibilities
and
be
mindful
that
some
colleges
may
not
accept
early
graduation
summer
projects
can
provide
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
explore
their
own
interests
and
learn
something
valuable
in
the
process
when
it
comes
to
summer
projects
there
are
two
main
approaches
student designed
projects
and
teacher designed
projects
when
a
student
designs
their
own
summer
project
they
can
have
much
more
autonomy
over
their
learning
this
allows
them
to
investigate
a
particular
topic
in
more
detail
and
creates
a
richer
learning
experience
as
they
get
to
work
on
an
area
of
their
choice
it
encourages
creative
thinking
and
helps
to
instill
a
sense
of
ownership
in
the
learning
process
additionally
it
allows
students
to
focus
on
their
own
passions
and
abilities
and
develop
a
deeper
understanding
than
what
may
be
possible
within
the
confines
of
a
classroom
lesson
in
contrast
when
a
teacher
designs
a
summer
project
it
may
give
students
an
opportunity
to
learn
something
new
and
collaborate
in
a
structured
way
teacher designed
projects
offer
a
sense
of
direction
and
structure
and
may
be
beneficial
for
students
who
require
more
guidance
to
focus
their
learning
working
together
as
part
of
a
group
project
can
help
to
foster
teamwork
and
help
to
enhance
problem solving
skills
it
also
ensures
that
students
are
exposed
to
certain
topics
that
they
may
have
not
otherwise
explored
overall
both
student designed
projects
and
teacher designed
projects
offer
their
own
unique
rewards
and
can
be
beneficial
depending
on
the
situation
and
the
students
needs
finally
it
s
important
to
remember
that
the
best
approach
is
often
a
combination
of
the
two
allowing
students
to
explore
topics
of
their
choice
while
still
adhering
to
a
specific
set
of
learning
guidelines
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
rather
than
the
traditional
four year
period
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
in
terms
of
saving
time
and
money
unfortunately
this
accelerated
timeline
can
come
at
the
cost
of
overexerting
the
student
staying
on
top
of
daily
workload
and
taking
multiple
and
more
difficult
courses
per
year
can
lead
to
exhaustion
and
decreased
academic
performance
furthermore
when
attempting
to
graduate
early
students
may
be
tempted
to
allocate
more
of
their
time
and
energy
towards
classes
that
they
are
good
at
and
neglect
other
courses
leading
to
an
imbalance
in
their
educational
experience
if
a
student
chooses
to
forgo
a
summer
break
in
order
to
keep
on
track
for
graduating
early
they
risk
running
themselves
too
thin
and
may
become
burnt
out
all
things
considered
trying
to
graduate
in
three
years
instead
of
four
can
be
advantageous
in
some
circumstances
however
it
is
important
for
the
student
to
consider
the
consequences
that
come
with
it
one
of
the
most
important
responsibilities
of
students
is
to
give
back
to
their
community
by
requiring
students
to
perform
community
service
it
will
teach
them
to
be
compassionate
and
generous
while
also
becoming
better
citizens
and
members
of
society
service
can
help
students
foster
relationships
with
members
of
their
community
something
they
may
not
have
done
otherwise
it
may
even
help
them
to
become
more
empathetic
people
develop
leadership
capabilities
and
even
boost
their
career
achievements
in
addition
students
can
use
community
service
to
gain
skills
and
important
experience
in
areas
of
their
interests
engaging
in
community
service
allows
students
to
explore
possible
career
areas
by
getting
a
firsthand
look
at
different
jobs
that
they
may
not
have
been
aware
of
otherwise
lastly
requiring
students
to
perform
community
service
will
also
give
them
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
ownership
of
their
own
lives
they
will
learn
that
their
actions
matter
and
have
an
impact
beyond
their
individual
lives
for
all
these
reasons
i
urge
you
to
consider
making
community
service
a
required
part
of
the
curriculum
not
only
will
students
benefit
directly
from
performing
community
service
but
our
community
as
a
whole
will
be
enriched
by
their
involvement
you
for
your
consideration
choosing
a
career
at
a
young
age
has
both
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
those
opposed
to
making
a
career
choice
in
their
youth
are
concerned
that
it
will
prevent
them
from
exploring
other
options
in
other
fields
or
even
from
forming
an
in depth
understanding
of
their
chosen
industry
on
the
other
hand
those
supporting
choosing
a
career
early
believe
that
it
gives
young
people
a
chance
to
focus
on
a
specific
goal
and
gives
them
the
determination
to
strive
for
it
matter
which
side
of
the
argument
you
fall
on
there
are
countless
examples
of
people
who
achieved
their
goals
despite
settling
for
a
career
path
while
they
were
still
young
one
example
is
who
was
a
year old
sophomore
when
he
launched
the
now
widely
popular
platform
s
success
story
we
can
see
that
committing
to
a
career
early
in
life
can
set
young
people
up
for
higher
levels
of
achievement
rather
than
wasting
time
exploring
several
unrelated
fields
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
allows
students
to
gain
valuable
experience
and
hone
their
skills
paving
the
way
for
possible
success
ultimately
there
will
always
be
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
choosing
a
career
at
a
young
age

for
those

and
to
leading
a

life
by
embracing
a
positive
outlook
we
can
open
up
a
world
of
new
possibilities
completing
high
school
in
three
years
is
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
some
students
as
it
allows
them
to
finish
school
before
the
traditional
four year
plan
and
move
on
to
college
or
other
activities
at
a
younger
age
by
taking
summer
school
evening
classes
or
fewer
elective
courses
students
may
be
able
to
cut
down
their
time
spent
in
school
and
get
an
early
start
on
the
future
however
graduating
high
school
early
is
not
without
its
drawbacks
obtaining
a
driver
s
license
finding
a
job
or
getting
into
a
good
college
may
be
more
difficult
if
a
student
does
not
have
the
skills
or
maturity
of
a
traditional
four year
student
the
inability
to
complete
elective
courses
or
take
advantage
of
more
engaging
topics
may
also
hinder
a
student
s
chances
at
success
after
high
school
i
believe
that
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
should
be
considered
on
a
case by case
basis
as
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
student
to
decide
if
they
are
mature
disciplined
and
academically prepared
enough
to
pursue
such
an
aggressive
course
of
study
in
summary
if
students
are
well equipped
to
handle
the
all encompassing
demands
of
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
it
can
be
a
great
opportunity
to
reach
their
paths
to
success
earlier
and
put
them
at
an
advantage
for
their
post high
school
journey
failure
is
an
essential
part
of
any
successful
pursuit
while
succeeding
in
our
goals
can
often
bring
us
feelings
of
joy
and
pride
it
s
important
to
remember
that
failure
is
an
inevitable
and
necessary
part
of
growth
by
acknowledging
our
mistakes
shortcomings
and
areas
of
improvement
we
can
gain
invaluable
insight
and
experience
additionally
when
we
make
mistakes
we
can
stay
motivated
and
encouraged
by
shifting
our
focus
to
learning
and
growth
as
we
strive
to
reach
success
it
s
important
to
not
let
failure
define
our
journey
but
instead
to
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
focus
on
learning
and
growth
while
maintaining
our
enthusiasm
and
energy
as
we
journey
through
life
it
is
important
to
strive
to
grow
in
order
to
strengthen
our
skills
and
improve
our
abilities
trying
new
things
instead
of
staying
in
the
same
place
and
never
growing
is
a
great
way
to
accomplish
this
by
exposing
ourselves
to
new
experiences
we
can
discover
talents
or
skills
that
we
may
have
never
known
we
had
learning
to
cook
a
new
recipe
or
playing
a
new
sport
for
the
first
time
can
open
us
up
to
completely
new
skills
and
new
talents
that
we
can
explore
for
example
taking
a
pottery
class
could
open
up
a
whole
new
world
of
three dimensional
art
that
we
had
no
idea
we
could
create
or
if
we
decide
to
learn
an
instrument
we
can
surprise
ourselves
with
our
own
aural
abilities
trying
new
things
can
also
help
us
gain
valuable
knowledge
for
the
future
and
help
us
build
self confidence
so
if
you
ve
ever
wondered
how
you
can
become
the
best
version
of
yourself
start
reaching
out
of
your
comfort
zone
and
try
something
new
it
may
present
you
with
new
and
unexpected
opportunities
to
grow and
who
knows
you
just
might
find
a
new
passion
or
talent
you
never
knew
you
had
one
major
factor
to
consider
when
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
is
the
financial
aspect
young
people
who
have
already
chosen
a
career
path
may
find
themselves
in
a
better
financial
situation
than
those
who
have
yet
to
decide
young
people
may
have
access
to
career specific
grants
and
scholarships
that
can
help
them
pay
for
college
or
training
programs
on
the
other
hand
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
may
limit
a
person
s
options
if
their
interests
change
people
may
have
difficulty
changing
career
paths
due
to
lack
of
experience
in
other
industries
or
may
feel
stuck
in
their
chosen
field
furthermore
commitment
to
a
single
career
can
be
emotionally
and
psychologically
taxing
as
there
may
be
a
pressure
to
excel
or
maintain
a
standard
that
others
have
set
ultimately
before
committing
to
a
career
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
doing
so
as
educational
institutions
and
lawmakers
look
for
ways
to
improve
students
academic
success
there
is
intense
debate
over
whether
student
involvement
in
extracurricular
activities
should
be
mandated
by
schools
or
left
up
to
each
individual
family
although
many
would
argue
that
it
is
the
schools
responsibility
to
provide
activities
for
students
there
are
several
reasons
why
families
should
make
this
decision
extracurricular
activities
are
often
highly
personal
all
children
have
different
interests
and
curiosities
and
by
allowing
families
to
choose
which
extracurricular
activities
are
right
for
their
children
it
allows
children
to
explore
the
activities
that
genuinely
appeal
to
their
individual
needs
and
desires
the
family
has
the
strongest
ties
to
the
child
and
deep
knowledge
of
the
child
s
abilities
and
goals
this
understanding
gives
them
the
best
knowledge
of
what
activities
will
best
benefit
their
child
which
a
school
may
lack
finally
when
extracurricular
involvement
is
decided
by
the
family
it
brings
the
family
closer
together
families
often
work
together
closely
to
decide
which
activities
are
right
for
their
children
building
an
increased
sense
of
communication
and
trust
between
the
parent
and
child
overall
extracurricular
activities
should
be
a
decision
left
up
to
families
not
schools
allowing
families
to
make
this
decision
ensures
that
the
child
participates
in
activities
that
are
tailored
to
his
or
her
interests
and
abilities
strengthens
the
bond
between
the
family
and
provides
the
family
with
the
most
intimate
knowledge
of
their
own
child
one
popular
method
of
building
self esteem
in
students
is
to
employ
either
praise
or
a
focus
on
achieving
when
it
comes
to
analyzing
the
effectiveness
of
these
two
methods
opinions
are
often
divided
some
educators
believe
that
praising
is
more
effective
and
has
a
greater
impact
on
a
student
s
self esteem
they
argue
that
praising
encourages
students
to
strive
for
excellence
and
appreciate
their
strengths
it
also
motivates
them
making
it
easier
for
the
student
to
achieve
their
goals
however
other
educators
stress
the
importance
of
focusing
on
achievement
rather
than
praise
by
achieving
meaningful
goals
students
become
better
equipped
to
build
confidence
and
a
positive
self image
this
allows
them
to
feel
proud
of
their
accomplishments
and
generates
a
rewarding
sense
of
satisfaction
when
it
comes
to
building
self esteem
with
students
both
praising
and
achieving
have
both
notable
benefits
and
drawbacks
a
focus
on
achieving
allows
students
to
build
self confidence
in
the
long term
while
praising
can
provide
a
short term
improvement
in
morale
but
when
excessive
praising
can
also
create
doubts
in
students
ability
and
cause
them
to
become
dependent
on
praise
similarly
too
much
emphasis
on
achievement
can
result
in
students
becoming
fixated
on
perfectionism
placing
unrealistic
standards
on
themselves
while
opinions
may
vary
research
suggests
that
a
balanced
approach
which
combines
both
praising
and
achieving
is
the
most
effective
way
of
building
self esteem
in
students
by
providing
meaningful
praise
and
setting
achievable
goals
students
can
increase
their
self confidence
and
develop
a
positive
self image
the
idea
of
a
four
day
school
week
has
been
gaining
traction
in
recent
years
particularly
among
educators
and
school
administrators
who
are
seeking
to
find
new
ways
to
improve
educational
outcomes
while
there
are
several
potential
benefits
to
a
four
day
school
week
such
as
streamlined
calendars
that
allow
teachers
and
students
additional
free
time
for
more
rest
and
relaxation
there
are
also
a
number
of
drawbacks
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
these
include
additional
pressure
on
teachers
to
cram
in
more
lessons
during
the
condensed
weeks
as
well
as
additional
stress
and
fatigue
for
students
who
have
to
cram
more
information
into
a
shorter
timeframe
in
contrast
a
seven
day
school
week
provides
many
advantages
over
a
four
day
school
week
especially
for
students
and
teachers
a
seven
day
school
week
can
provide
more
flexible
scheduling
and
an
increased
number
of
instructional
hours
while
allowing
for
more
frequent
breaks
and
downtime
to
give
students
and
teachers
a
much needed
reprieve
a
seven
day
school
week
offers
more
opportunity
for
teachers
to
engage
their
students
in
new
and
exciting
learning
activities
such
as
field
trips
and
other
hands on
educational
experiences
in
conclusion
a
seven
day
school
week
has
numerous
benefits
over
a
four
day
school
week
it
ensures
more
instructional
hours
more
flexible
scheduling
and
more
opportunities
for
students
to
engage
in
educational
activities
and
field
trips
additionally
it
also
offers
more
downtime
for
students
and
teachers
to
recharge
and
take
a
break
from
the
academic
pressure
they
experience
during
the
regular
school
week
overall
the
seven
day
school
week
offers
numerous
advantages
that
make
it
a
better
choice
for
both
students
and
teachers
the
essay
will
examine
the
role
that
failure
plays
in
individual
success
it
is
often
said
that
failure
is
an
essential
ingredient
in
developing
personal
success
to
understand
this
phenomenon
one
must
look
at
the
individual
experiences
and
successes
of
successful
people
for
example
i
can
personally
attest
to
the
power
of
failure
in
my
own
life
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
i
was
eventually
able
to
accomplish
my
goal
of
becoming
a
small
business
owner
similarly
many
successful
entrepreneurs
have
learned
from
their
own
failures
to
build
successful
businesses
such
stories
demonstrate
the
invaluable
lesson
that
without
failure
success
can
not
be
achieved
in
conclusion
when
it
comes
to
success
failure
is
not
only
necessary
it
is
inescapable
though
failure
can
be
painful
it
is
also
immensely
valuable
for
growth
and
development
without
failure
success
is
impossible
for
any
task
is
often
seen
as
a
key
factor
in
achieving
success
supporters
of
this
idea
believe
that
having
an
enthusiastic
attitude
towards
an
activity
will
help
carry
you
through
any
obstacles
on
the
way
to
achieving
the
end
goal
while
enthusiasm
is
a
powerful
tool
it
is
often
impossible
to
guarantee
that
it
will
always
result
in
success
having
an
eager
outlook
on
an
activity
can
make
the
whole
process
more
enjoyable
and
bring
an
extra
level
of
creativity
to
the
task
being
passionate
and
driven
to
achieve
the
best
results
can
help
drive
innovation
and
lead
to
the
production
of
work
which
is
above
and
beyond
what
was
expected
however
there
are
some
occasions
where
it
is
not
likely
that
these
higher
standards
will
be
met
and
enthusiasm
alone
can
not
carry
the
task
to
a
successful
conclusion
enthusiasm
without
a
practical
or
realistic
plan
for
success
means
that
the
initial
excitement
or
energy
is
not
likely
to
be
sustained
throughout
the
project
having
a
plan
in
place
to
make
sure
that
enthusiasm
does
not
falter
can
be
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
in
summary
while
enthusiasm
can
be
useful
and
is
often
seen
as
a
key
factor
in
achieving
success
it
is
not
guaranteed
to
lead
to
success
and
should
be
combined
with
a
practical
plan
in
order
to
reach
the
desired
outcome
is
a
fantastic
sport
with
many
amazing
benefits
not
only
can
it
help
improve
physical
health
it
can
also
improve
communication
and
relationships
playing
soccer
can
help
improve
communication
skills
by
teaching
players
the
fundamentals
of
communication
such
as
listening
following
instructions
and
cooperating
with
teammates
requires
players
to
work
together
in
order
to
achieve
their
goals
which
can
build
strong
relationships
among
teammates
moreover
soccer
can
help
improve
physical
health
by
providing
a
great
workout
and
strengthening
the
cardiovascular
system
it
can
also
help
improve
coordination
and
agility
which
can
prove
beneficial
for
overall
health
all
in
all
soccer
is
an
excellent
way
to
improve
communication
health
and
relationships

a
greater
likelihood
of
continuing
a
higher
education

pursue
creative
interests
without
the
pressure
of
finishing
a

furthermore
this
extra
time
is
beneficial
in
exploring
internships
and
other
professional
opportunities
that
are
n t
available
to
traditional
students
i
can
personally
attest
to
these
advantages
as
i
was
able
to
use
my
extra
time
to
gain
experience
in
my
field
by
training
in
a
professional
agency
being
able
to
land
an
internship
soon
after
graduating
early
was
difficult
but
the
time
i
had
to
prepare
made
it
possible
for
me
to
stand
out
during
the
interviewing
process
by
putting
myself
in
this
position
i
believe
i
had
an
edge
alongside
other
graduating
high
school
peers
overall
graduating
high
school
early
can
be
a
great
way
to
increase
success
later
on
benefits
such
as
more
available
time
to
pursue
higher
education
and
professional
endeavors
give
early
graduates
a
great
starting
point
year round
schooling
instead
of
the
more
common
schedule
is
one
way
school
districts
are
attempting
to
improve
the
quality
of
education
while
it
offers
some
potential
advantages
there
are
also
potential
disadvantages
to
consider
advantages
of
year round
school
include
the
potential
to
reduce
summer
learning
loss
students
who
attend
year round
schools
experience
shorter
breaks
throughout
the
year
which
allows
them
to
maintain
more
of
the
knowledge
they
acquire
during
the
school
year
additionally
year round
schools
may
benefit
from
increased
parental
involvement
as
parents
will
be
present
for
more
of
their
child
s
education
throughout
the
year
however
there
are
also
potential
disadvantages
to
consider
many
students
and
parents
may
dislike
the
lack
of
extended
summer
vacation
often
associated
with
year round
school
also
such
a
schedule
requires
additional
resources
such
as
additional
busing
and
buildings
which
may
be
a
burden
on
school
districts
with
limited
budgets
additionally
such
a
schedule
could
make
it
more
difficult
for
students
and
their
families
to
schedule
or
participate
in
summer
activities
or
travel
during
long
breaks
ultimately
considering
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
associated
with
year round
schooling
is
essential
for
school
districts
and
families
to
make
an
informed
decision
successful
people
often
demonstrate
a
positive
attitude
in
their
lives
which
has
helped
them
to
create
the
successful
life
they
desire
in
taking
risks
and
pursing
their
dream
they
have
relied
on
a
positive
attitude
to
guide
them
this
attitude
is
often
manifested
in
a
willingness
to
take
risks
and
have
faith
in
themselves
even
in
the
face
of
fear
or
uncertainty
with
a
positive
attitude
as
a
foundation
these
people
have
pushed
boundaries
and
achieved
success
they
are
also
often
happier
in
the
process
due
to
having
a
positive
outlook
and
appreciating
the
small
victories
along
the
way
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
achieving
the
successful
life
of
our
dreams
first
impressions
are
incredibly
powerful
as
they
often
determine
how
people
interact
with
each
other
going
forward
it
s
often
said
that
actions
speak
louder
than
words
and
when
it
comes
to
how
someone
first
views
you
that
adage
could
not
be
more
true
take
college
admissions
for
example
most
universities
look
at
more
than
just
a
student
s
test
scores
and
grades
what
extracurricular
activities
have
they
been
involved
in
what
kind
of
leadership
experience
if
any
have
they
had
actions
more
than
words
can
reveal
a
lot
about
who
a
person
is
and
what
kind
of
potential
they
have
the
same
idea
applies
to
the
way
someone
views
a
leader
in
politics
it
s
not
just
what
they
say
but
what
they
do is
their
platform
a
reflection
of
their
values
are
they
using
their
power
to
benefit
others
or
for
their
own
selfish
goals
speak
louder
than
words
when
trying
to
gauge
how
a
leader
should
be
viewed
in
the
public
eye
finally
when
it
comes
to
first
impressions
nothing
is
quite
as
impactful
as
taking
care
of
a
pet
someone
might
seem
kind
and
friendly
when
you
first
meet
them
but
seeing
how
they
interact
with
and
take
care
of
an
animal
can
truly
illustrate
the
kind
of
person
they
are
taking
on
a
pet
is
an
irreversible
commitment
for
better
or
for
worse
and
observing
how
someone
handles
that
responsibility
reveals
a
lot
about
their
character
ultimately
while
first
impressions
can
change
when
getting
to
know
someone
everyone
is
still
human
and
nobody
is
perfect
while
some
people
may
act
differently
around
certain
groups
or
in
certain
environments
it
s
important
to
remember
that
everyone
is
deserving
of
respect
and
kindness
vacation
has
long
been
a
staple
of
the
school
system
every
year
students
look
forward
to
the
break
from
school
before
the
start
of
summer
however
recent
disputes
have
been
raised
over
the
benefits
or
lack
thereof
of
this
extended
break
has
shown
that
taking
short
breaks
throughout
the
school
year
that
range
from
a
few
days
to
a
week
or
more
can
increase
student
engagement
and
retention
as
well
as
give
students
a
much
needed
mental
break
from
school
while
a
longer
summer
break
may
be
more
appealing
to
students
for
leisure
the
shorter
breaks
throughout
the
school
year
could
be
beneficial
in
the
long
run
on
the
other
hand
there
are
other
benefits
to
having
a
longer
summer
with
one
being
the
ability
to
reset
and
recharge
for
the
upcoming
school
year
overall
it
appears
that
having
a
longer
summer
break
could
provide
more
benefits
than
drawbacks
while
short
breaks
can
be
advantageous
during
the
school
year
it
is
often
more
beneficial
for
students
to
have
a
long
break
to
rest
and
prepare
for
the
next
school
year
keeping
the
length
of
the
summer
break
the
same
seems
to
be
the
most
beneficial
decision
for
students

further
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
sincerely
your
name
recently
our
school
has
decided
to
make
some
changes
to
the
food
served
in
the
cafeteria
for
lunch
while
i
understand
the
desire
to
provide
healthier
choices
to
the
students
i
believe
that
there
are
serious
drawbacks
to
the
new
food
that
have
not
been
considered
for
one
i
feel
that
the
new
food
is
not
as
appetizing
or
enjoyable
as
the
old
menu
the
students
are
no
longer
able
to
purchase
the
things
they
like
and
the
meals
taste
bland
and
unappetizing
additionally
the
portions
are
small
and
the
variety
is
lacking
meaning
students
are
often
left
feeling
unsatisfied
and
hungry
the
new
food
has
not
only
changed
the
taste
of
the
meals
but
also
the
atmosphere
in
the
cafeteria
with
less
appealing
food
the
noise
level
has
decreased
as
fewer
students
come
to
eat
together
and
socialize
in
conclusion
although
i
understand
the
motivation
behind
the
change
i
do
not
feel
that
it
has
been
beneficial
to
the
student
body
the
lack
of
variety
small
portions
and
unappealing
taste
makes
me
question
the
decision
to
change
the
lunch
menu
vacations
are
much needed
breaks
from
the
demands
of
school
however
long
breaks
like
summer
or
spring
can
make
it
difficult
to
retain
information
learned
during
the
school
year
with
a
little
planning
and
effort
there
are
several
strategies
you
can
use
to
retain
school
information
during
your
time
away
one
effective
strategy
is
to
review
the
most
important
information
the
week
before
your
break
this
will
help
to
refresh
your
memory
as
well
as
ensure
that
you
don
t
forget
any
key
points
during
your
time
off
you
can
also
create
flashcards
with
key
concepts
and
topics
and
review
them
periodically
throughout
the
vacation
in
order
to
keep
the
information
fresh
in
your
mind
an
additional
strategy
is
to
make
a
game
out
of
it
for
example
you
could
create
a
quiz
with
friends
or
family
about
the
material
you
ve
been
studying
or
if
you
re
the
competitive
type
you
can
create
a
scoring
system
to
see
who
scores
the
highest
this
is
a
great
way
to
make
studying
fun
and
engaging
while
helping
you
remember
the
information
for
when
you
return
to
school
finally
any
additional
reading
or
research
related
to
the
topics
you
ve
been
studying
can
also
assist
in
retaining
information
taking
a
fresh
approach
to
a
subject
or
exploring
the
same
topic
in
a
different
way
can
help
you
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
material
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
strategies
you
can
use
to
retain
school
information
during
a
summer
or
spring
break
with
some
planning
and
a
little
extra
effort
you
can
ensure
that
you
don
t
forget
the
information
you
ve
been
studying
when
you
get
back
to
school
the
longstanding
debate
over
character
traits
revolves
around
the
question
of
whether
these
traits
are
shaped
by
external
influences
or
determined
by
an
individual
s
own
sense
of
identity
on
one
side
those
who
believe
in
an
individual
s
capacity
for
self determination
argue
that
each
person
is
in
control
of
their
own
personal
destiny
making
independent
decisions
about
their
character
traits
morals
and
values
on
the
other
hand
those
who
favor
the
idea
that
character
is
shaped
by
environmental
influences
argue
that
cultural
and
societal
factors
also
play
an
important
role
in
shaping
an
individual
s
identity
each
side
offers
compelling
arguments
in
support
of
their
view
making
it
difficult
to
determine
which
of
the
two
perspectives
is
more
valid
ultimately
the
debate
over
character
traits
illuminates
how
different
individuals
possess
distinct
convictions
about
the
way
in
which
personality
is
formed
and
expressed
is
a
vibrant
and
diverse
country
with
plenty
of
unique
foods
experiences
and
activities
to
be
explored
from
feijoada
a
national
dish
of
black
beans
and
pork
to
the
traditional
açaí
smoothie
made
from
the
amazonian
berry
cuisine
lovers
are
sure
to
be
delighted
for
those
looking
for
an
immersive
experience
consider
experiencing
a
traditional
festival
or
parade
the
popular
is
one
of
the
most
well known
parades
to
explore
held
annually
in
preparation
for
the
religious
season
of
if
you
d
like
to
gain
an
even
deeper
understanding
of
the
culture
learning
how
to
say
some
basic
phrases
in
is
worthwhile
a
few
phrases
like
bom
dia
good
morning
por
favor
please
and
obrigado
thank
you
will
go
a
long
way
to
showing
your
willingness
to
engage
in
the
culture
the
ability
to
stay
productive
is
an
important
quality
that
many
successful
people
share
an
active
or
productive
person
can
be
defined
as
someone
who
uses
their
time
wisely
and
proactively
works
towards
achieving
their
goals
on
the
other
hand
an
idle
or
non productive
person
is
someone
who
spends
more
time
being
inactive
and
distracted
and
tends
to
lack
a
sense
of
accomplishment
the
active
person
is
likely
to
have
more
success
because
they
are
proactive
in
reaching
their
goals
they
set
goals
and
take
steps
to
work
towards
achieving
them
in
a
timely
manner
they
create
schedules
to
increase
their
productivity
and
stay
organized
additionally
they
often
have
a
network
of
supportive
people
around
them
and
are
less
likely
to
develop
bad
habits
such
as
procrastination
the
idle
person
more
often
than
not
fails
to
reach
their
goals
and
remains
stuck
in
a
state
of
inactivity
they
struggle
to
stay
motivated
and
lack
the
tools
needed
to
stay
organized
additionally
they
may
suffer
from
negative
thinking
that
leads
to
a
lack
of
ambition
and
hinders
their
progress
furthermore
they
may
not
realize
the
importance
of
setting
goals
and
plans
in
order
to
reach
their
desired
outcomes
often
waiting
for
the
right
opportunity
rather
than
taking
action
to
create
it
ultimately
the
difference
between
an
active
and
idle
person
is
evident
in
the
potential
for
success
those
who
stay
productive
are
far
more
likely
to
achieve
their
goals
and
lead
a
fulfilling
life
on
the
other
hand
those
who
stay
idle
may
find
themselves
in
a
perpetual
state
of
inaction
and
fail
to
reach
their
full
potential
cafeteria
lunches
are
an
important
part
of
the
learning
environment
has
shown
that
nutritional
lunches
can
impact
student
s
health
learning
capabilities
and
academic
performance
therefore
carefully
examining
the
pros
and
cons
of
changing
the
school
lunch
menu
is
essential
one
advantage
of
changing
the
school
lunch
menu
is
the
ability
to
provide
students
with
healthier
options
could
introduce
more
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
as
well
as
a
wider
selection
of
whole
grains
and
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
doing
so
may
encourage
students
to
make
healthier
choices
and
reduce
their
consumption
of
unhealthy
processed
foods
additionally
it
could
lead
to
improvements
in
students
overall
health
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
changing
the
school
lunch
menu
it
could
potentially
limit
the
selection
of
food
choices
may
choose
to
eliminate
some
popular
menu
items
in
order
to
make
room
for
healthier
options
this
could
negatively
impact
student
satisfaction
and
lead
to
dissatisfaction
with
the
menu
introducing
new
and
healthier
options
can
come
at
a
cost
may
not
have
the
resources
to
purchase
healthier
food
or
they
may
need
to
raise
prices
on
existing
menu
items
in
order
to
make
room
for
healthier
options
overall
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
changing
the
school
lunch
menu
it
is
important
to
carefully
weigh
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
before
deciding
whether
or
not
to
make
any
changes
doing
so
can
ensure
that
students
are
receiving
the
most
nutritious
and
enjoyable
lunches
possible
the
debate
over
the
traditional
school
day
is
a
prevalent
one
among
educators
students
and
parents
alike
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
argument
for
a
longer
school
day
which
may
provide
extra
time
for
various
electives
and
tutorials
that
can
help
students
who
need
extra
assistance
on
the
other
hand
proponents
of
the
traditional
school
day
argue
that
this
extra
time
has
the
potential
to
be
too
demanding
and
may
lead
to
student
fatigue
after
researching
the
pros
and
cons
of
changing
the
school
day
i
believe
that
there
should
be
a
balance
between
the
traditional
length
of
the
school
day
and
the
addition
of
extra
time
for
electives
and
tutorials
for
students
who
need
extra
help
providing
these
extra
opportunities
could
benefit
students
who
need
extra
help
while
still
protecting
the
students
from
too
much
exhaustion
in
my
opinion
this
balance
is
essential
for
a
successful
school
day
when
teaching
in
a
classroom
where
both
younger
and
older
students
are
present
it
is
important
to
remember
that
each
student
has
different
learning
needs
creative
methods
such
as
using
games
stories
and
visuals
can
help
keep
young
students
engaged
and
can
also
help
explain
difficult
topics
when
introducing
a
new
topic
present
it
in
a
way
that
is
age appropriate
to
all
students
in
the
class
additionally
it
is
important
to
demonstrate
passion
for
the
topic
this
will
help
motivate
the
students
and
can
help
make
learning
more
fun
finally
be
conscious
of
the
different
interests
of
the
younger
students
when
setting
the
learning
objectives
this
will
help
them
stay
engaged
and
will
also
ensure
that
everyone
in
the
classroom
can
learn
the
material
in
a
world
that
constantly
tells
us
to
change
who
we
are
in
order
to
fit
in
it
can
be
easy
to
forget
what
makes
us
unique
and
individual
however
being
true
to
ourselves
and
our
own
interests
allows
us
to
embark
on
wondrous
journeys
that
others
might
not
embark
upon
for
example
if
we
ignored
the
pressures
of
society
to
conform
we
might
choose
to
visit
awe inspiring
places
like
a
lush
green
forest
a
secluded
mountain
valley
or
a
magnificent
waterfall
being
true
to
ourselves
also
opens
us
up
to
understanding
life
in
a
different
way
because
nature
is
beautiful
and
ever changing
it
can
show
us
how
fragile
and
fleeting
our
lives
can
be
but
also
how
lasting
and
purposeful
that
life
can
be
if
we
are
ourselves
was
well known
for
stating
that
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
i
could
not
agree
more
with
this
statement
when
we
stay
true
to
ourselves
and
dismiss
the
external
pressures
of
society
we
are
able
to
find
and
explore
new
parts
of
ourselves
we
never
thought
possible
we
hone
our
individual
skills
and
abilities
and
discover
our
true
passions
we
can
accept
life
on
our
own
terms
and
be
content
with
who
we
are
and
where
we
are
going
by
staying
true
to
ourselves
we
can
accomplish
great
things
a
few
years
ago
i
remember
a
small
but
meaningful
act
of
kindness
i
performed
for
one
of
my
closest
friends
we
had
been
friends
for
years
but
recently
she
had
been
going
through
a
really
tough
time
one
day
after
class
i
decided
to
make
her
a
small
snack
i
made
her
a
simple
garden
salad
with
all
her
favourite
toppings
along
with
a
freshly
baked
chocolate
chip
cookie
it
was
nothing
extravagant
but
i
hoped
it
would
show
her
that
i
was
thinking
of
her
she
was
very
touched
when
i
presented
her
with
the
snack
she
thanked
me
and
said
it
was
more
than
she
ever
expected
she
added
that
the
small
gesture
meant
a
lot
to
her
in
that
moment
that
day
i
realized
that
the
smallest
acts
of
kindness
can
make
a
world
of
difference
as
the
debate
over
how
to
best
enhance
the
educational
system
rages
on
one
potential
solution
that
has
recently
captivated
the
attention
of
many
is
extending
the
school
day
two
hours
in
a
four day
school
week
supporters
of
this
plan
point
to
the
potential
benefits
such
as
students
having
more
time
to
dedicate
to
mastering
core
material
and
teachers
having
the
opportunity
to
provide
more
personalized
instruction
and
one on one
time
they
also
point
out
the
potential
for
creative
activities
such
as
extracurriculars
clubs
and
field
trips
to
be
better
integrated
into
the
structure
of
a
shortened
school
week
however
upping
the
amount
of
time
our
children
spend
at
school
can
also
have
some
unwanted
side
effects
for
one
students
may
feel
overwhelmed
and
exhausted
by
the
amount
of
schoolwork
and
homework
they
must
take
on
with
the
extended
school
day
in
addition
lack
of
sleep
an
unhealthy
diet
and
increased
exposure
to
stress
can
all
lead
to
poor
academic
performance
furthermore
there
may
be
costs
associated
with
the
shift
to
a
four day
week
that
are
too
expensive
for
some
families
ultimately
it
is
crucial
that
all
stakeholders parents
teachers
administrators
and
students come
together
and
carefully
weigh
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
extending
the
school
day
two
hours
in
a
four day
week
before
enacting
any
changes
it
is
only
through
discussion
and
thoughtful
deliberation
that
we
can
ensure
that
such
changes
will
be
made
in
the
best
interest
of
our
children
s
education
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
offer
many
potential
benefits
not
just
to
those
considering
a
career
path
but
also
to
the
wider
society
those
who
commit
to
a
career
early
benefit
from
the
opportunity
to
specialize
in
a
much
shorter
time
frame
allowing
them
to
become
experts
in
their
field
and
develop
skills
relevant
to
their
chosen
field
this
experience
can
also
open
up
doors
to
further
educational
opportunities
such
as
postsecondary
study
by
committing
to
a
career
early
individuals
demonstrate
a
level
of
maturity
and
a
dedication
to
the
profession
which
can
have
a
positive
influence
on
their
job
prospects
furthermore
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
increases
the
likelihood
of
finding
meaningful
employment
quicker
and
with
greater
job
satisfaction
on
the
other
hand
those
who
wait
to
commit
to
a
career
until
later
may
find
more
varied
experiences
but
these
experiences
may
not
be
related
to
a
chosen
profession
or
field
one
of
the
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
make
school
lunches
more
enjoyable
for
students
is
to
serve
fresher
healthier
foods
this
can
be
achieved
by
including
more
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
as
well
as
wholesome
whole
grains
lean
proteins
and
other
healthful
components
additionally
school
lunches
should
be
prepared
in
a
safe
and
hygienic
manner
with
kitchen
staff
following
best
practices
of
sanitizing
and
cooking
food
thoroughly
to
address
the
potential
consequence
of
removing
popular
items
from
school
lunch
menus
alternative
foods
can
be
offered
as
substitutes
the
goal
should
be
to
provide
options
that
still
provide
nutritional
benefits
without
sacrificing
the
taste
and
enjoyment
for
students
for
example
healthier
versions
of
macaroni
and
cheese
pizza
and
taco
dishes
can
be
created
that
retain
the
traditional
flavor
profile
while
providing
a
nutrient rich
meal
by
taking
these
steps
schools
can
create
more
enjoyable
and
nutritionally
sound
lunch
options
for
their
students

attitude
is
an
important
factor
in
achieving
success
in
life

just
having
a
good
perspective
on
things
and
requires
commitment
and
focus
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
when
faced
with
adversity

as
opportunities
to
learn
and
grow

motivated
and

of
our
goals

don
t
go

also
helps
us
maintain
strong
relationships
with
the
people
around
us
it
provides
an
environment
of
positivity
that
encourages
others
and
allows
us
to
be
better
communicators
a
positive
attitude
can
be
contagious
and
encourage
those
around
us
to
be
more
optimistic
as
well
in
addition
a
positive
attitude
can
improve
physical
and
mental
health
it
helps
to
reduce
stress
levels
boost
our
immune
system
and
make
us
more
resilient
in
the
face
of
difficulties
having
a
positive
attitude
is
key
to
achieving
success
in
life
when
challenged
it
gives
us
the
grit
and
determination
to
keep
going
to
identify
and
seize
opportunities
and
to
stay
connected
with
the
people
around
us
it
is
a
powerful
tool
that
acts
as
a
foundation
for
overall
well being
first
impressions
are
an
important
part
of
forming
relationships
but
they
can
also
be
difficult
to
change
on
the
one
hand
first
impressions
are
impossible
to
change
because
they
are
formed
in
mere
moments
and
can
be
hard
to
undo
someone
has
formed
a
first
impression
of
a
person
it
can
last
an
entire
lifetime
for
example
if
someone
makes
a
bad
impression
at
first
glance
this
can
be
difficult
to
turn
around
and
it
could
leave
a
lasting
negative
impact
on
their
reputation
on
the
other
hand
first
impressions
can
be
changed
it
takes
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
to
right
the
wrongs
of
first
impressions
but
it
is
possible
for
instance
if
someone
makes
a
bad
first
impression
they
can
take
steps
to
demonstrate
they
are
a
kind
thoughtful
and
hardworking
person
through
meaningful
and
deep
conversations
along
with
good
actions
an
individual
can
slowly
start
to
change
someone
s
perception
of
them
and
form
a
more
positive
first
impression
after school
tutoring
can
improve
student
achievement
and
help
them
understand
their
homework
more
effectively
through
attentive
student teacher
instruction
students
can
benefit
from
a
better
understanding
of
the
material
they
are
studying
however
after school
tutoring
sessions
can
be
burdensome
for
some
students
due
to
the
time
it
takes
away
from
their
free
time
it
is
important
for
parents
to
help
their
children
find
a
balance
between
their
studies
and
leisure
activities
parents
can
encourage
their
children
to
take
ownership
of
their
studies
while
at
school
as
well
as
create
a
structured
home
environment
where
homework
can
get
done
with
the
support
of
teachers
parents
and
after school
tutors
students
can
see
their
academic
performance
improve
and
have
the
opportunity
to
realize
their
learning
potential
sowing
is
often
seen
as
a
way
to
reap
the
rewards
in
terms
of
personal
and
financial
success
it
is
a
valuable
investment
strategy
that
can
be
used
to
generate
money
as
well
as
save
money
and
help
others
in
need
whether
it
be
a
healing
salve
or
a
bountiful
harvest
of
vegetables
sowing
can
provide
a
reliable
source
of
income
in
times
of
need
it
is
also
a
viable
career
option
with
colleges
now
offering
classes
on
the
subject
sowing
has
the
potential
to
provide
sustainable
wealth
not
only
in
the
short term
but
also
in
the
long term
as
we
reflect
on
the
role
that
sowing
plays
in
achieving
financial
success
we
must
also
remember
to
recognize
its
importance
as
a
humanitarian
effort
and
not
just
a
money making
tool
working
alone
or
working
in
a
group
provides
different
benefits
to
student
learning
working
alone
can
provide
a
student
with
the
distraction free
environment
needed
to
focus
and
concentrate
on
a
task
or
assignment
however
working
in
a
group
can
stimulate
a
student
s
creativity
and
collaboration
skills
allowing
for
a
deeper
understanding
of
difficult
topics
when
working
alone
a
student
can
benefit
from
undivided
attention
and
full
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
working
alone
will
also
give
a
student
the
liberty
to
use
new
strategies
which
would
allow
them
to
work
through
obstacles
in
their
own
way
also
through
self paced
learning
the
student
can
gain
a
sense
of
fulfillment
and
accomplishment
over
the
work
they
have
put
into
completing
the
task
on
the
other
hand
when
students
work
in
a
group
they
can
take
advantage
of
being
able
to
brainstorm
students
can
work
together
to
generate
ideas
and
come
up
with
solutions
usually
leading
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
a
subject
which
wouldn
t
have
been
reached
when
working
alone
working
in
a
group
setting
can
also
provide
a
student
with
instant
feedback
from
their
peers
leading
to
an
improved
understanding
of
the
subject
being
discussed
in
conclusion
both
working
alone
and
in
a
group
have
their
own
set
of
advantages
and
each
student
should
take
into
consideration
their
own
working
style
when
deciding
which
is
best
for
them
working
alone
provides
undivided
attention
and
fits
better
with
some
student
s
learning
strategies
while
working
in
a
group
encourages
collaboration
and
group
think
which
will
undoubtedly
benefit
the
student
in
the
long
run
taking
an
online
course
is
becoming
a
popular
option
among
students
and
working
professionals
alike
due
to
its
convenience
and
cost
effectiveness
courses
provide
a
flexible
schedule
that
allows
students
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
and
in
their
own
time
thus
making
them
ideal
for
those
with
full time
jobs
or
busy
lifestyles
furthermore
the
cost
of
an
online
course
is
usually
much
lower
than
a
seven hour
education
course
however
one
disadvantage
of
taking
online
courses
is
the
lack
of
direct
interaction
with
the
instructor
as
the
course
is
delivered
over
the
internet
it
can
be
difficult
to
get
immediate
guidance
and
feedback
additionally
students
lack
the
classroom based
environment
of
a
seven hour
education
course
which
can
limit
their
ability
to
collaborate
and
engage
in
group
discussions
with
their
peers
nevertheless
despite
its
drawbacks
taking
online
courses
can
still
be
a
great
route
for
learning
new
skills
and
advancing
one
s
knowledge
online
courses
offer
a
wide
range
of
subjects
which
are
often
updated
to
reflect
the
latest
trends
providing
students
with
the
most
up to date
information
with
these
courses
students
also
have
access
to
a
plethora
of
digital
resources
such
as
video
recordings
and
articles
as
well
as
the
opportunity
to
connect
with
like minded
individuals
from
around
the
globe
in
conclusion
both
online
courses
and
a
seven hour
education
course
have
their
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
individual
to
decide
which
route
best
suits
their
needs
and
goals
for
many
students
there
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
identifying
a
career
at
a
young
age
early
determination
of
a
career
may
allow
for
a
student
to
develop
important
skills
such
as
ambition
focus
and
organization
as
well
as
the
ability
to
manage
their
time
efficiently
however
students
may
face
challenges
such
as
deciding
too
soon
what
career
to
pursue
or
struggling
to
find
opportunities
in
their
chosen
field
parents
and
schools
play
a
crucial
role
in
helping
students
make
this
decision
when
it
comes
to
career
planning
schools
provide
resources
such
as
potential
college
or
vocational
school
paths
parents
may
also
lend
guidance
offering
their
own
experiences
or
suggestions
on
what
may
be
a
good
fit
for
their
child
it
s
also
important
to
note
that
different
circumstances
such
as
economic
background
can
hugely
influence
students
career
decision making
process
the
availability
of
resources
transportation
and
educational
opportunities
can
have
dramatic
effects
on
a
student
s
ability
to
pursue
their
desired
career
path
ultimately
it
is
important
for
students
to
access
a
variety
of
information
to
make
an
informed
decision
when
determining
a
career
adding
variety
to
the
school
lunch
menu
has
the
potential
to
provide
students
with
appealing
nutritional
meals
to
assess
the
needs
of
the
student
body
we
conducted
interviews
with
students
to
better
understand
what
type
of
food
they
would
like
to
see
in
the
menu
additionally
a
survey
was
created
to
determine
what
type
of
food
would
be
most
popular
among
students
popular
menu
items
from
the
survey
included
hummus
with
pita
bread
whole
grain
wraps
and
vegetarian
sushi
from
these
findings
five
different
foods
were
established
to
be
added
to
the
school
lunch
menu
pizza
with
whole
wheat
crust
vegan
enchiladas
turkey
sliders
bulgur
salad
and
eggplant
parmesan
to
explain
how
a
new
menu
could
benefit
students
a
presentation
was
created
detailing
the
health
benefits
of
the
new
menu
items
with
these
menu
additions
schools
can
offer
students
nutritious
interesting
meals
that
they
can
look
forward
to
in
the
lunchroom
as
the
challenges
of
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
become
more
established
we
need
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
issues
and
how
we
can
best
address
them
many
students
who
finish
high
school
in
a
condensed
timeframe
may
struggle
with
the
adjustment
to
college
life
not
participating
in
typically
senior
years
activities
such
as
prom
senior
trips
or
senior
lock ins
can
be
disappointing
for
these
students
being
in
advanced
classes
also
put
pressure
on
students
to
keep
up
with
their
studies
and
peers
at
a
more
accelerated
pace
in
order
to
battle
these
issues
it
is
important
for
students
to
be
well
prepared
for
college
they
should
actively
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
and
take
advantage
of
on campus
support
services
such
as
mental
health
counselors
academic
advisors
and
mentors
additionally
for
students
who
are
looking
for
more
immediate
relief
there
are
alternative
options
available
such
as
taking
college
classes
while
still
in
high
school
or
taking
a
gap
year
between
high
school
and
college
for
those
experiencing
financial
difficulty
seeking
financial
aid
or
applying
for
grants
and
scholarships
is
a
great
way
to
help
cover
college
expenses
overall
it
is
important
for
students
graduating
high
school
in
a
condensed
timeframe
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
issues
they
could
face
but
also
possible
solutions
with
ample
preparation
support
and
alternative
options
students
can
still
achieve
their
post secondary
dreams
the
notion
of
working
alone
goes
against
logic
as
it
is
commonly
accepted
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
however
there
are
distinct
advantages
to
working
without
the
input
of
others
primarily
working
alone
allows
for
an
individual
to
thrive
in
their
own
way
and
be
creative
working
towards
a
common
goal
made
easier
by
not
having
to
take
input
from
others
as
such
a
person
can
work
at
their
own
pace
determine
their
own
target
timeframes
and
think
more
deeply
about
a
particular
problem
or
task
working
with
a
group
also
has
its
benefits
with
a
group
individuals
can
pool
their
knowledge
towards
a
shared
goal
and
make
substantial
progress
much
faster
when
working
in
a
group
tasks
can
be
divided
up
and
assigned
to
each
person
increasing
efficiency
and
driving
performance
in
the
end
the
advantages
of
working
alone
outweigh
the
benefits
of
working
with
a
group
with
a
focused
level
of
work
and
no
input
from
others
a
person
can
work
better
and
faster
to
accomplish
their
end
goal
it
is
important
to
stay
disciplined
and
organized
when
working
alone
as
it
becomes
harder
to
track
deadlines
and
stay
on
task
without
the
accountability
of
a
group
ultimately
working
alone
can
help
an
individual
reach
their
ultimate
potential
and
be
more
productive
in
the
modern
workplace
working
alone
versus
working
in
groups
is
a
constant
debate
working
alone
can
often
provide
an
individual
with
the
freedom
to
focus
solely
on
their
own
output
giving
them
total
control
over
the
end
product
however
there
are
great
advantages
to
working
in
a
team
making
it
a
more
valued
choice
in
many
professional
and
educational
environments
when
working
in
groups
individuals
can
combine
knowledge
share
work
and
build upon
one
another
s
ideas
and
experience
working
in
a
team
can
also
provide
an
opportunity
to
build
upon
skills
such
as
communication
collaboration
and
problem solving
though
teams
can
come
to
better
solutions
than
individuals
not
every
situation
calls
for
a
group
effort
and
sometimes
having
multiple
people
working
on
the
same
thing
can
be
more
of
a
distraction
additionally
disagreements
can
arise
in
group
settings
and
individual
goals
and
motivations
can
get
lost
no
matter
which
approach
yields
better
results
working
in
teams
or
working
alone
there
are
lasting
memories
which
can
be
gained
from
both
from
working
alone
strength
in
self sufficiency
and
independence
can
arise
from
working
in
teams
strong
connections
and
community
are
built
for
workers
in
the
future
reflecting
on
the
experiences
with
others
and
the
memories
created
will
continue
to
be
beneficial
success
does
not
come
without
encountering
failures
along
the
way
as
so
astutely
concluded
success
is
attained
from
being
able
to
move
from
failure
to
failure
without
diminishing
enthusiasm
mistakes
are
an
inescapable
part
of
the
journey
towards
success
without
making
mistakes
we
are
unable
to
learn
and
grow
looking
at
my
own
journey
i
have
had
to
confront
my
fair
share
of
mistakes
yet
i
have
used
them
as
a
learning
opportunity
to
better
myself
and
my
understanding
of
a
particular
situation
consequently
i
believe
it
is
essential
to
be
aware
of
the
possible
outcomes
and
consequences
before
taking
any
action
thinking
about
the
repercussions
of
my
decisions
not
only
promotes
accountability
but
it
also
helps
to
maintain
a
positive
reputation
and
the
faith
of
those
around
me
with
the
implementation
of
a
three
year
high
school
program
students
have
the
unique
opportunity
to
graduate
with
their
peers
after
only
three
years
of
study
and
dedicate
the
fourth
year
to
plan
for
their
future
taking
electives
throughout
high
school
could
open
up
more
possibilities
for
students
after
graduation
they
can
explore
fields
of
interest
that
they
might
not
have
had
time
to
consider
previously
on
the
other
hand
rushing
through
the
final
year
courses
could
leave
students
without
a
fundamental
understanding
of
certain
subjects
making
them
less
competitive
for
higher
education
and
specialized
job
opportunities
they
might
also
miss
out
on
important
experiences
such
as
joining
clubs
engaging
in
extra curricular
activities
and
finding
study
buddies
to
help
them
grasp
complex
topics
overall
taking
the
option
to
graduate
high
school
in
three
years
is
a
personal
decision
that
depends
on
a
student
s
academic
abilities
and
goals
while
it
certainly
offers
a
unique
opportunity
for
students
and
their
families
care
must
be
taken
to
ensure
that
they
are
reaching
their
academic
potential
and
have
access
to
the
same
tools
and
resources
as
a
four
year
program
to
ensure
success
when
it
comes
to
forming
first
impressions
humans
often
rely
heavily
on
environmental
and
parental
influences
for
instance
a
child
with
a
parent
who
has
a
naturally
outgoing
personality
is
likely
to
be
influenced
to
be
an
extrovert
similarly
a
child
who
experiences
a
chaotic
or
oppressive
home
environment
may
find
it
difficult
to
be
open
and
trust
strangers
even
a
positive
home
environment
can
have
an
impact
on
a
person
s
first
impressions
as
a
growing
child
is
likely
to
take
on
the
values
and
beliefs
of
their
parents
as
they
form
their
own
identity
environmental
influences
people
also
rely
on
their
own
internal
emotional
responses
for
forming
first
impressions
they
may
be
influenced
by
their
own
facial
expressions
thoughts
and
bodily
reactions
in
response
to
a
new
situation
or
person
in
this
way
first
impressions
are
a
combination
of
both
the
individual
s
and
their
environment
s
impact
and
it
is
possible
to
both
form
and
change
a
perception
of
a
person
it
is
important
to
always
be
yourself
and
never
let
others
influence
who
you
are
we
each
have
our
own
gifts
and
talents
that
we
should
be
proud
of
when
we
give
in
to
the
opinions
and
pressures
of
others
we
are
not
being
true
to
ourselves
it
is
our
job
to
be
confident
in
our
own
abilities
and
to
know
that
our
paths
are
unique
to
us
a
great
real life
example
of
this
is
she
did
not
let
the
pressure
of
the
music
industry
shape
her
talent
or
who
she
is
as
a
person
she
was
true
to
herself
her
sound
and
her
style
staying
true
to
the
core
of
what
makes
her
unique
and
is
now
one
of
the
most
successful
singers
of
our
time
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
life
will
have
its
difficult
days
but
if
you
remain
confident
in
your
abilities
and
keep
yourself
true
to
who
you
are
you
can
push
through
anything
being
yourself
will
lead
to
growth
greater
self awareness
and
the
confidence
to
truly
stand
out
and
make
your
own
mark
in
the
world
so
never
give
up
never
lose
sight
of
who
you
are
and
always
remember
to
be
yourself
knowing
that
facing
a
problem
is
an
opportunity
to
do
your
best
not
a
setback
is
one
of
the
greatest
realizations
one
can
come
to
problems
are
a
chance
to
learn
and
grow
they
provide
an
unbeatable
opportunity
to
try
again
and
do
better
one
of
the
reasons
why
facing
a
problem
is
a
chance
to
do
your
best
is
because
it
teaches
you
resilience
the
more
problems
you
overcome
the
greater
sense
of
self confidence
you
will
have
knowing
you
can
tackle
the
next
challenge
that
comes
your
way
facing
a
problem
is
like
building
your
own
muscle
the
more
you
use
it
the
stronger
it
gets
another
reason
why
a
problem
is
a
chance
to
do
your
best
is
because
it
encourages
creative
thinking
by
having
to
think
outside
of
the
box
to
come
up
with
solutions
you
re
actually
encouraging
your
own
growth
as
a
critical
thinker
innovative
ideas
as
opposed
to
solutions
that
have
always
been
repeated
will
be
explored
when
faced
with
a
problem
that
needs
to
be
solved
moreover
facing
a
problem
is
an
opportunity
to
hone
your
skills
every
problem
presents
a
unique
set
of
challenges
that
require
a
different
set
of
skills
and
knowledge
to
solve
this
in
turn
helps
you
to
become
a
better
problem
solver
for
future
issues
enabling
you
to
react
faster
and
understand
deeply
rooted
issues
with
greater
ease
in
conclusion
problems
are
not
a
setback
but
a
chance
to
do
your
best
it
teaches
you
resilience
encourages
creative
thinking
and
helps
you
hone
your
skills
facing
a
problem
is
an
opportunity
that
should
be
taken
advantage
of
as
it
not
only
prepares
you
for
future
challenges
but
serves
as
a
learning
experience
that
can
greatly
benefit
you
in
life
the
impact
of
having
a
positive
attitude
on
achieving
success
in
life
has
long
been
recognized
has
revealed
numerous
examples
of
individuals
who
have
achieved
success
through
adopting
a
positive
attitude
for
example
the
physicist
and
chemist
persevered
despite
facing
discrimination
and
other
challenges
as
a
woman
in
a
male dominated
field
her
positive
attitude
enabled
her
to
overcome
the
obstacles
she
encountered
and
to
achieve
great
success
in
her
career
in
contrast
having
a
negative
attitude
can
have
serious
implications
for
achieving
success
in
life
negative
thinking
can
make
it
difficult
to
set
goals
and
it
can
lead
to
feelings
of
discouragement
or
hopelessness
studies
have
shown
that
a
positive
attitude
can
provide
benefits
such
as
increased
motivation
and
resilience
even
during
challenging
times
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
an
asset
in
achieving
success
in
life
it
can
allow
individuals
to
focus
on
the
possibilities
rather
than
the
limitations
they
may
encounter
a
positive
attitude
can
help
drive
individuals
to
push
through
difficult
times
and
to
make
the
most
of
their
opportunities
extending
the
school
day
is
a
controversial
issue
that
has
split
opinions
among
educators
parents
and
students
alike
on
one
hand
advocates
of
extended
school
days
argue
that
students
will
benefit
from
additional
instruction
time
and
schoolwork
allowing
them
to
gain
more
knowledge
and
skills
and
potentially
earn
better
grades
furthermore
they
argue
that
an
extended
day
will
provide
children
with
more
time
to
participate
in
extra curricular
activities
which
can
benefit
the
child
s
social
and
emotional
development
on
the
other
hand
opponents
of
the
extended
school
day
fear
that
such
a
measure
could
cause
more
harm
than
good
they
point
out
that
children
could
become
increasingly
overworked
and
overwhelmed
with
the
additional
amount
of
work
they
also
argue
that
students
need
a
break
to
be
able
to
relax
and
reset
after
a
long
day
of
studying
or
else
they
may
become
more
susceptible
to
burnout
additionally
longer
school
days
could
also
negatively
impact
the
quality
of
instruction
as
teachers
may
have
to
rush
through
classes
to
fit
in
more
material
in
conclusion
the
decision
of
whether
to
implement
an
extended
school
day
should
be
carefully
assessed
by
the
school
and
district
taking
into
account
both
the
potential
positives
and
negatives
of
such
a
measure
ultimately
the
best
decision
should
be
what
is
most
beneficial
for
the
students
and
their
overall
academic
success
one
potential
advantage
of
allowing
high
school
students
to
graduate
after
spending
three
years
instead
of
four
is
that
students
would
be
able
to
start
college
a
year
earlier
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
finish
their
degree
faster
and
become
more
competitive
in
the
job
market
additionally
the
three year
system
would
give
students
an
opportunity
to
explore
their
interests
and
develop
specializations
in
a
particular
field
while
there
are
potential
benefits
to
a
three year
high
school
system
there
are
also
drawbacks
to
consider
for
students
who
may
not
be
academically
advanced
or
ready
to
tackle
college level
courses
graduating
after
three
years
could
leave
them
unprepared
and
unable
to
compete
in
college
or
the
job
market
additionally
a
three year
system
would
require
students
to
complete
more
courses
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
leading
to
an
increased
workload
and
stress
for
students
recounted
the
process
of
learning
how
to
push
themselves
out
of
their
comfort
zone
in
an
effort
to
grow
and
create
something
new
they
had
to
learn
to
accept
failure
as
just
another
step
in
getting
closer
to
success
they
realized
that
the
more
risks
they
took
and
the
more
times
they
failed
the
more
they
would
learn
and
the
closer
they
would
be
to
realizing
a
new
level
of
personal
growth
despite
their
commitment
to
improvement
they
acknowledged
that
there
would
be
considerable
obstacles
ahead
they
anticipated
the
fear
of
failure
they
would
experience
when
taking
risks
as
well
as
moments
of
self doubt
when
considering
how
to
make
progress
they
had
to
learn
to
stay
persistent
and
find
the
motivation
to
keep
pushing
through
the
challenging
moments
viewed
their
journey
as
an
opportunity
to
recognize
their
internal
strengths
and
use
them
as
fuel
for
personal
growth
by
understanding
that
their
successes
and
failures
would
build
up
to
a
larger
more
meaningful
achievement
they
hoped
to
stay
motivated
and
focus
on
their
progress
in
order
to
improve
their
own
lives
sports
science
and
musical
activities
are
all
enjoyable
educational
activities
available
in
our
school
both
sports
and
science
activities
involve
learning
and
can
also
be
fun
for
students
but
musical
activities
often
provide
an
immediate
sense
of
enjoyment
and
can
be
more
thrilling
through
musical
activities
students
can
cultivate
their
creativity
learn
to
work
with
others
and
build
self confidence
i
personally
find
musical
activities
to
be
the
most
enjoyable
form
of
educational
activity
within
our
school
because
of
the
direct
links
to
art
creativity
and
collaboration
i
remember
my
first
foray
into
musical
activities
in
school
when
i
signed
up
for
choir
i
was
able
to
learn
music
theory
collaborate
with
the
other
members
to
create
beautiful
melodies
and
there
was
always
a
sense
of
joy
and
accomplishment
when
we
accomplished
something
great
performing
on
stage
in
front
of
an
audience
and
seeing
their
reactions
is
one
of
the
most
fulfilling
experiences
i
have
ever
had
overall
musical
activities
provide
an
opportunity
for
students
to
explore
and
develop
their
creative
side
and
to
reap
the
rewards
of
hard
work
it
is
this
immediate
sense
of
enjoyment
combined
with
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
that
makes
it
the
most
enjoyable
educational
activity
for
me
biking
during
the
summer
can
be
a
fun
and
enjoyable
activity
for
both
novice
and
experienced
riders
with
so
many
different
places
to
bike
it
can
be
difficult
to
decide
where
to
explore
however
there
are
many
places
to
bike
that
provide
a
variety
of
activities
while
still
taking
advantage
of
the
warm
weather
from
exploring
the
wide
open
countryside
to
discovering
tourist
attractions
when
it
comes
to
activities
to
do
while
biking
there
are
countless
possibilities
biking
can
be
a
great
way
to
get
to
a
variety
of
places
quickly
and
enjoy
the
scenery
along
the
way
whether
you
are
interested
in
sightseeing
shopping
or
trying
local
cuisine
bike
riding
can
offer
an
enjoyable
experience
to
make
biking
even
more
enjoyable
there
are
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
bringing
along
food
drinks
and
snacks
is
essential
for
keeping
energy
levels
up
on
long
rides
it
can
also
be
useful
to
bring
along
friends
and
family
to
enjoy
the
experience
together
additionally
check
the
weather
before
leaving
and
make
sure
to
bring
the
necessary
protective
clothing
and
sunscreen
biking
during
the
summer
is
an
excellent
way
to
enjoy
the
outdoors
and
take
advantage
of
the
warm
weather
exploring
new
places
around
town
or
simply
taking
a
leisurely
ride
to
spend
time
with
friends
and
family
can
provide
an
excellent
way
to
make
the
most
of
summertime
with
the
right
supplies
and
the
right
routines
biking
can
offer
a
wonderful
exclamation
on
the
summer
season
working
together
is
a
highly
advantageous
solution
to
overcoming
a
difficult
task
when
people
come
together
to
collaborate
on
an
issue
the
amount
of
work
that
needs
to
be
done
is
reduced
significantly
because
the
task
is
shared
amongst
multiple
individuals
this
promotes
efficiency
as
each
person
is
able
to
focus
on
their
particular
area
of
specialization
and
build
off
of
each
other
s
ideas
and
skills
to
create
a
comprehensive
solution
working
in
a
group
also
creates
opportunities
to
utilize
different
skill
sets
such
as
problem solving
organization
and
communication
that
would
be
difficult
to
accomplish
alone
working
together
provides
the
benefit
of
constructive
criticism
when
several
people
collaborate
on
a
project
they
each
have
a
unique
perspective
and
can
offer
valuable
feedback
to
enhance
the
end
result
this
is
especially
beneficial
for
students
as
they
can
learn
from
one
another
and
develop
more
effective
problem solving
skills
while
working
together
does
have
its
benefits
it
can
also
be
a
double edged
sword
for
certain
tasks
working
on
your
own
can
allow
for
uninterrupted
focus
which
can
lead
to
faster
results
it
can
also
be
difficult
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
a
group
of
people
and
the
amount
of
energy
that
goes
into
discussing
ideas
can
be
draining
overall
the
importance
of
collaboration
can
not
be
overstated
while
there
are
certainly
times
when
working
alone
can
be
beneficial
the
power
of
team
work
and
diversity
should
not
be
underestimated
working
together
brings
out
the
best
of
each
person
creates
more
efficient
solutions
and
ultimately
leads
to
a
better
end
result
recent
studies
have
shown
that
the
health
of
students
can
greatly
improve
by
providing
healthier
meal
options
in
school
cafeterias
a
proposal
for
the
implementation
of
more
nutritious
meals
in
the
school
cafeteria
could
include
an
increase
in
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
whole
grain
products
low fat
and
non fat
dairy
products
lean
proteins
and
calorie limited
snacks
the
cost
benefits
of
this
would
be
twofold
replacing
unhealthy
food
items
with
healthier
options
would
help
to
reduce
costs
associated
with
health
complications
caused
by
unhealthy
eating
habits
and
increasing
the
number
of
healthy
options
would
provide
students
with
a
wider
selection
of
affordable
foods
leading
to
economic
benefits
on
the
student
side
in
terms
of
health
benefits
this
would
ensure
that
students
have
access
to
ingredients
and
dishes
that
are
better
for
their
health
allowing
them
to
reach
their
full
potential
in
both
academic
and
athletic
endeavors
as
students
are
given
less
time
to
complete
a
task
the
consequences
of
longer
hours
could
extend
from
both
mental
psychological
and
physical
capacities
with
a
shortened
period
of
time
to
learn
there
could
be
a
higher
level
of
stress
or
burnout
for
a
student
during
longer
hours
students
have
less
time
to
engage
in
after
school
activities
which
may
potentially
affect
their
development
outside
of
academics
and
may
further
cause
psychological
and
mental
strain
at
the
same
time
a
shorter
period
with
an
extended
hours
could
provide
the
institution
with
a
more
efficient
way
of
teaching
as
more
content
can
be
covered
in
a
shorter
span
of
time
it
is
important
to
balance
the
need
for
an
enhanced
learning
environment
with
the
other
important
aspects
of
a
student
s
life
that
could
be
affected
from
extended
hours
work
environments
offer
a
variety
of
advantages
that
can
increase
productivity
improve
decision
making
and
provide
financial
benefits
for
both
employers
and
employees
working
together
allows
for
faster
production
and
improved
problem
solving
thanks
to
a
larger
pool
of
ideas
and
resources
working
in
a
group
can
also
help
cultivate
an
atmosphere
of
collaboration
and
help
foster
team
building
employers
can
realize
cost
savings
as
a
result
of
increased
efficiency
and
better
resource
utilization
while
at
the
same
time
employees
can
benefit
from
better
working
conditions
and
increased
financial
rewards
although
there
are
numerous
benefits
to
working
in
a
group
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
there
are
downsides
to
working
in
this
type
of
environment
the
most
common
issues
that
arise
during
collaborations
include
conflicts
in
personalities
and
clashing
opinions
which
can
often
lead
to
decreased
morale
and
negative
attitudes
to
reduce
these
potential
issues
it
is
important
to
set
clear
rules
and
expectations
from
the
outset
ensure
everyone
is
properly
trained
and
have
a
designated
leader
who
can
step
in
when
necessary
additionally
team
members
should
be
encouraged
to
practice
active
listening
respect
each
other
s
opinions
and
take
turns
in
offering
their
ideas
and
perspectives
by
implementing
these
practices
employers
and
employees
can
benefit
from
the
many
advantages
of
working
in
a
group
while
avoiding
the
potential
pitfalls
in
a
world
filled
with
expectations
it
can
be
difficult
to
remain
true
to
oneself
the
struggles
of
being
yourself
can
often
be
compounded
for
immigrant
populations
teenagers
and
those
who
are
considered
different
for
example
immigrant
families
often
have
to
deal
with
different
cultures
expectations
and
norms
which
can
make
it
hard
for
them
to
stay
true
to
their
identity
and
beliefs
teenagers
in
particular
frequently
have
to
face
peer
pressure
to
conform
to
certain
standards
and
ideals
which
again
can
make
it
difficult
to
be
their
authentic
selves
and
those
who
are
seen
as
different
whether
because
of
their
personal
preferences
physical
appearance
or
anything
else
often
have
to
battle
against
negative
stereotypes
in
order
to
remain
true
to
themselves
despite
these
difficulties
however
it
is
possible
to
be
yourself
even
in
difficult
situations
for
example
it
can
be
beneficial
to
surround
oneself
with
people
who
can
support
encourage
and
motivate
you
to
be
your
true
self
free
from
judgement
it
can
also
be
beneficial
to
identify
and
nurture
your
passions
and
engage
in
meaningful
activities
through
these
means
it
is
possible
to
stick
to
your
values
and
be
your
true
self
in
spite
of
any
pressure
to
conform
indeed
being
yourself
in
less
than
ideal
conditions
can
be
the
greatest
accomplishment
of
all
by
remaining
true
to
your
authentic
self
you
can
stay
confident
and
maintain
your
integrity
even
when
facing
adversity
it
is
a
difficult
but
ultimately
rewarding
feat
one
which
is
worthy
of
celebration
and
acknowledgement
having
a
good
attitude
can
bring
so
many
positive
effects
into
one
s
life
it
can
open
up
opportunities
cultivate
strong
relationships
and
lead
to
overall
success
here
are
three
examples
that
demonstrate
how
having
a
good
attitude
can
lead
to
success
with
an
optimistic
outlook
one
can
stay
focused
on
their
goals
by
overcoming
obstacles
and
setbacks
this
can
lead
to
increased
motivation
and
productivity
leading
to
more
success
moreover
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
to
build
relationships
with
others
a
person
with
a
good
attitude
can
make
others
feel
comfortable
around
them
while
also
communicating
their
own
desires
and
needs
lastly
having
a
good
attitude
can
also
lead
to
improved
physical
health
with
an
optimistic
outlook
people
are
less
likely
to
stress
over
the
little
things
and
experience
lower
levels
of
anxiety
and
depression
having
a
good
attitude
can
certainly
help
lead
one
to
a
life
of
success
and
fulfillment
it
is
important
to
realize
the
power
our
attitudes
have
on
our
lives
and
make
sure
to
cultivate
a
positive
outlook
despite
sometimes
feeling
overwhelming
problems
can
ultimately
benefit
people
by
helping
them
to
grow
and
develop
problems
can
teach
us
valuable
lessons
develop
our
problem solving
skills
and
provide
us
with
new
opportunities
by
facing
and
overcoming
difficult
issues
we
learn
valuable
lessons
that
will
help
us
in
the
future
we
get
to
know
ourselves
better
and
also
become
more
experienced
in
dealing
with
difficult
situations
every
time
we
encounter
a
problem
or
challenge
we
strengthen
our
problem solving
skills
and
our
resilience
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
future
in
addition
problems
can
create
new
opportunities
for
us
we
can
use
crises
as
incentives
to
innovate
and
come
up
with
creative
solutions
this
can
lead
to
new
achievements
successes
or
even
new
careers
problems
can
be
a
great
opportunity
to
discover
new
activities
or
interests
that
we
may
have
never
even
considered
before
in
conclusion
while
problems
can
seem
daunting
or
overwhelming
in
the
moment
they
can
ultimately
be
beneficial
and
help
us
to
grow
and
develop
as
individuals
we
can
use
problems
to
build
our
character
learn
valuable
lessons
and
discover
new
opportunities
it
helps
to
remember
that
any
difficulties
are
only
temporary
and
that
there
are
lessons
and
even
potential
successes
to
be
gained
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
immense
benefits
in
both
our
personal
and
professional
lives
by
approaching
situations
with
an
optimistic
outlook
we
are
more
likely
to
foster
success
one
example
of
this
concept
is
the
idea
that
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
us
to
endure
challenging
circumstances
such
as
difficult
professional
deadlines
or
personal
conflicts
additionally
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
those
around
us
as
those
with
a
sunny
disposition
are
generally
viewed
more
favorably
by
others
on
the
other
hand
having
a
negative
attitude
can
soon
become
a
self fulfilling
prophecy
it
may
lead
to
us
expecting
the
worst
out
of
everything
eventually
leading
to
decreased
success
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
is
therefore
a
key
component
of
a
vital
and
functional
life
enabling
us
to
strive
for
the
successes
of
which
we
are
capable
first
impressions
can
have
a
lasting
impact
and
in
many
instances
they
are
almost
impossible
to
change
this
is
because
we
tend
to
use
first
impressions
as
benchmarks
in
forming
an
opinion
about
someone
or
something
as
a
result
first
impressions
can
shape
our
future
interactions
and
experiences
with
them
to
illustrate
the
effects
of
first
impressions
i
ll
use
an
example
from
my
own
life
as
a
freshman
in
high
school
i
was
excited
to
join
the
basketball
team
upon
entering
the
gym
for
the
team
s
first
practice
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
already
had
a
negative
reputation
among
some
of
my
teammates
at
first
i
couldn
t
understand
why
they
were
so
skeptical
about
me
but
then
i
realized
that
my
reputation
was
based
on
a
poor
first
impression
unbeknownst
to
me
my
teammates
had
already
judged
me
based
on
my
physical
appearance
and
the
fact
that
i
was
new
to
the
team
despite
the
fact
that
i
worked
extremely
hard
to
gain
their
trust
and
admiration
i
found
that
it
was
a
losing
battle
due
to
my
poor
first
impression
these
experiences
have
taught
me
that
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
despite
our
best
efforts
those
who
make
an
unimpressive
first
impression
often
find
that
subsequent
efforts
to
shake
the
initial
perception
are
simply
not
enough
as
a
result
first
impressions
can
have
a
lasting
impact
and
it
s
important
to
make
a
good
one
when
you
meet
someone
for
the
first
time
the
city
of
is
the
perfect
destination
for
a
summer
vacation
from
exciting
outdoor
activities
and
thrilling
sports
matches
to
relaxing
days
spent
exploring
the
city
there
is
something
for
everyone
after
researching
the
activities
available
in
it
s
time
to
make
a
plan
of
which
sports
to
participate
in
this
summer
depending
on
the
interests
of
the
family
there
are
several
sports
options
such
as
surfing
cycling
and
tennis
additionally
offers
plenty
of
cultural
attractions
to
enjoy
including
galleries
museums
and
festivals
be
sure
to
make
a
list
of
the
different
places
to
visit
this
summer
when
it
comes
to
travel
expenses
is
an
affordable
destination
due
to
its
various
lodging
options
and
restaurants
with
a
bit
of
preparation
and
planning
a
family
trip
to
can
work
within
any
budget
by
researching
travel
costs
and
summer
school
opportunities
and
how
these
can
be
incorporated
into
the
overall
plan
of
the
trip
with
careful
consideration
of
these
aspects
a
family
can
create
a
detailed
plan
of
their
perfect
summer
vacation
in
the
decision
to
leave
high
school
early
is
becoming
more
commonplace
with
more
students
opting
to
finish
their
studies
prior
to
the
conventional
date
this
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
implications
for
the
student
and
the
school
on
the
one
hand
it
gives
the
student
a
chance
to
enter
the
workforce
or
college
early
and
possibly
gain
more
experience
on
the
other
hand
it
can
deprive
the
student
of
crucial
educational
opportunities
and
the
chance
to
make
important
social
connections
with
peers
for
the
school
there
are
a
variety
of
pros
and
cons
to
consider
since
students
are
spending
less
time
in
school
there
may
be
a
decrease
in
total
revenue
especially
if
the
school
relies
heavily
on
funding
through
student
tuition
alternatively
it
may
enable
schools
to
focus
their
resources
and
attention
on
those
students
who
are
more
likely
to
stay
for
all
four
years
it
is
important
to
consider
the
long term
implications
of
leaving
school
early
for
both
the
student
and
the
school
short term
benefits
may
not
be
realized
in
the
future
as
a
lack
of
certain
qualifications
and
experiences
may
place
students
at
a
disadvantage
the
consequences
of
having
more
students
finishing
high
school
early
should
be
taken
into
account
when
making
this
decision
at
employee
growth
and
development

constantly
strives
to
make
improvements
wherever
possible
having
a
positive
attitude
can
drastically
impact
many
aspects
of
life
such
as
communication
job
opportunities
and
education
when
communicating
with
others
those
with
a
positive
attitude
tend
to
come
off
as
more
approachable
this
can
lead
to
better

positive
attitude
can
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
various
aspects
of
life
curfews
have
been
a
topic
of
contention
in
the
states
for
some
time
different
regions
have
their
own
laws
in
place
that
regulate
what
age
children
are
required
to
be
indoors
by
a
certain
time
with
consequences
for
those
who
break
these
laws
debate
has
been
sparked
over
whether
a
nationwide
curfew
law
should
be
imposed
in
the
states
adults
tend
to
be
in
favor
of
a
nationwide
curfew
law
citing
it
as
a
way
to
protect
children
and
keep
them
off
the
streets
after
dark
opponents
of
a
nationwide
curfew
law
argue
that
individual
communities
should
be
allowed
to
set
their
own
rules
arguing
that
curfews
are
only
effective
if
children
will
obey
them
young
people
on
the
other
hand
are
more
likely
to
oppose
a
nationwide
curfew
law
many
believe
that
curfews
are
overly
restrictive
and
take
away
their
right
to
make
their
own
decisions
they
contend
that
there
are
more
effective
ways
to
protect
children
than
to
impose
a
nationwide
law
a
nationwide
curfew
law
could
have
several
potential
pros
and
cons
on
the
plus
side
it
could
help
protect
children
from
potential
harm
additionally
it
could
also
improve
the
safety
of
roads
and
help
to
reduce
criminal
activity
at
night
on
the
other
hand
a
nationwide
curfew
law
could
also
give
the
government
too
much
power
and
limit
individual
freedoms
overall
it
is
difficult
to
determine
if
a
nationwide
curfew
law
should
be
imposed
in
the
states
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
citizens
to
decide
if
they
believe
that
a
law
of
this
kind
is
necessary
being
successful
requires
pushing
past
our
comfort
levels
and
continually
developing
our
abilities
it
can
be
easy
to
stay
within
what
is
familiar
to
us
and
just
go
with
the
flow
but
that
often
leaves
us
stagnant
and
unable
to
progress
people
are
capable
of
so
much
more
than
they
realize
and
the
only
way
to
affect
positive
change
in
our
lives
is
to
push
beyond
our
current
boundaries
by
taking
ownership
of
our
personal
growth
rather
than
waiting
for
others
to
provide
us
with
new
opportunities
we
can
actively
pursue
knowledge
and
skills
whether
that
s
through
formal
education
trying
something
new
or
furthering
existing
skills
the
challenge
and
rewards
of
going
beyond
our
current
abilities
will
prove
to
be
valuable
we
can
learn
to
be
more
resilient
when
faced
with
difficult
obstacles
and
create
stronger
bonds
with
others
when
we
understand
the
value
of
self improvement
and
pushing
the
boundaries
the
attitude
of
refusing
to
accept
our
current
abilities
and
continuing
to
strive
for
improvement
can
be
applied
to
all
aspects
of
life
ranging
from
career
achievements
and
relationships
to
fitness
and
mental
health
with
consistent
effort
personal
growth
can
become
something
that
becomes
a
part
of
who
we
are
ultimately
to
become
successful
we
need
to
be
devoted
to
continuously
pushing
ourselves
and
pursuing
new
challenges
and
opportunities
in
order
to
grow
and
develop
this
can
be
difficult
but
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
evolve
and
succeed
i
recently
studied
the
inspiring
life
of
former
british
and
his
incredible
journey
to
success
despite
numerous
failures
throughout
his
life
he
refused
to
give
up
and
continued
to
push
forward
even
when
the
odds
were
against
him
his
words
of
wisdom
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
resonated
with
me
and
i
realized
how
this
could
be
incredibly
empowering
to
incorporate
into
my
own
life
as
a
student
i
often
get
bogged
down
in
small
failures
i
experience
in
my
academics
leading
to
a
lack
of
confidence
in
my
ability
to
achieve
my
goals
after
reading
s
statement
i
no
longer
allow
myself
to
get
discouraged
by
occasional
setbacks
instead
i
now
approach
challenges
with
enthusiasm
treating
them
as
learning
experiences
and
finding
opportunities
to
grow
from
them
i
can
see
how
this
same
mentality
has
been
true
for
a
close
friend
of
mine
who
dreamed
of
starting
her
own
business
although
she
encountered
numerous
failures
before
she
eventually
achieved
success
her
enthusiasm
never
wavered
throughout
her
journey
her
inspiring
story
has
affirmed
the
truth
of
s
statement
that
through
determination
and
perseverance
success
can
be
possible
if
we
stay
motivated
and
do
n t
give
up
sports
is
an
important
part
of
students
lives
for
numerous
reasons
many
studies
and
anecdotal
evidence
from
experts
have
shown
that
playing
sports
can
have
a
very
positive
effect
on
students
academic
performance
the
physical
activities
associated
with
team
sports
can
help
students
stay
alert
and
organized
additionally
the
structure
of
a
team
and
the
guidance
of
a
coach
can
help
students
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
which
can
lead
to
increased
academic
performance
and
confidence
i
am
writing
to
you
in
opposition
to
the
policy
change
that
requires
a
grade
average
for
participation
in
extra curricular
activities
such
as
team
sports
i
believe
that
this
policy
is
counter productive
because
it
fails
to
consider
the
invaluable
benefits
of
participation
in
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
in
general
utilizing
sports
as
a
tool
to
promote
academic
success
and
organization
is
a
proven
method
that
can
help
engage
students
in
their
studies
while
also
helping
to
improve
their
academic
performance
spending
quality
time
with
family
has
become
increasingly
difficult
in
our
digital
age
however
outdoor
activities
provide
a
way
to
come
together
and
reconnect
with
each
other
exploring
the
world
and
meeting
new
people
are
just
a
few
of
the
ways
that
you
can
bring
the
family
together
and
have
a
great
time
not
only
is
it
the
perfect
way
to
enjoy
each
other
s
company
but
also
you
can
take
time
away
from
electronic
devices
and
get
back
in
touch
with
nature
being
in
nature
can
help
relieve
stress
and
bring
peace
of
mind
whether
it
s
going
on
a
nature
hike
camping
or
some
other
outdoor
activity
it
s
a
great
opportunity
to
bond
with
family
and
reap
the
stress
relief
benefits
of
being
outdoors
it
is
often
said
that
one
can
accomplish
more
if
they
are
always
doing
something
productive
has
many
benefits
including
helping
an
individual
achieve
success
examples
of
the
types
of
benefits
that
can
be
gained
through
productivity
include
increased
focus
and
self discipline
improved
motivation
and
the
creation
of
healthier
routines
additionally
productivity
can
help
someone
stay
on
track
and
reach
their
goals
more
quickly
visualizing
success
is
another
concept
to
consider
when
striving
for
success
having
a
goal
in
mind
and
working
hard
towards
it
can
help
keep
someone
motivated
and
productive
in
reaching
their
goals
gaining
an
extra
half
an
hour
of
school
each
day
could
be
incredibly
beneficial
for
students
not
only
will
it
lead
to
improved
educational
outcomes
but
it
also
provides
access
to
greater
job
opportunities
and
improved
test
prep
capabilities
by
investing
in
more
school
time
students
are
better
able
to
understand
complex
ideas
problem
solve
and
cultivate
creative
thinking
moreover
this
additional
school
time
could
enable
better
preparation
for
tests
and
exams
giving
students
more
confidence
and
greater
assurance
when
setting
out
to
ace
their
courses
furthermore
more
school
time
could
lead
to
greater
exposure
to
a
variety
of
skills
and
subject
areas
that
could
be
helpful
in
future
jobs
ultimately
this
expanded
school
time
could
give
students
the
edge
they
need
to
be
more
successful
in
their
educational
and
professional
endeavors
when
it
comes
to
selecting
a
career
path
it
can
be
challenging
for
a
young
adult
to
decide
what
is
right
for
them
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
path
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
sure
that
you
are
selecting
the
right
one
on
the
one
hand
there
are
benefits
of
committing
to
a
career
early
on
settling
on
a
path
can
help
with
focus
and
goal
setting
however
it
is
also
beneficial
for
young
people
to
explore
new
things
during
their
formative
years
in
order
to
discover
their
passions
and
hobbies
for
those
students
who
decide
on
a
career
when
starting
college
there
can
be
difficulties
associated
with
sticking
to
the
plan
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
decision
can
be
changed
and
there
are
ways
that
students
can
find
and
stay
on
the
path
that
they
have
selected
each
person
should
take
the
necessary
time
to
research
and
consider
their
career
options
this
can
lead
to
a
more
fulfilling
career
in
the
long
run
activities
are
essential
for
our
wellbeing
and
can
be
incredibly
enjoyable
research
has
shown
that
spending
time
in
nature
away
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
everyday
life
can
reduce
stress
improve
focus
and
even
bolster
our
immune
systems
with
so
many
available
options
such
as
camping

fishing
and
bird
watching

is
something
for
everyone
to
find
enjoyable
in
the
outdoors
when
camping
for
example
you
can
enjoy
the
beauty
of
nature
while
creating
meaningful
memories
with
friends
and
family
camping
can
also
give
you
the
chance
to
unplug
from
technology
and
take
a
break
from
everyday
life

re
sleeping
in
a
tent
or
an
cooking
over
a
campfire

a
very
rewarding
experience

another
activity
that

be
both
physically
and
mentally
beneficial
it
can
provide
an
opportunity
to
appreciate
nature
and
the
fresh

an
enchanting
country
with
plenty
of
attractions
that
make
it
a
favorite
destination
for
travelers
from
the
bustling
city
of
and
its
vibrant
nightlife
to
the
beautiful
countryside
and
picturesque
coastal
towns
there
is
something
for
everyone
in
this
diverse
country
the
traditional
cuisine
from
bustling
street
markets
to
high end
restaurants
is
one
of
the
main
draws
for
visitors
with
flavorsome
dishes
as
well
as
a
range
of
vibrant
cultural
activities
that
bring
the
history
of
to
life
as
the
country
is
largely
mountainous
visitors
can
explore
national
parks
with
seemingly
endless
trails
and
panoramic
views
there
are
also
healing
hot
springs
spas
and
authentic
temples
allowing
visitors
to
have
a
truly
relaxing
experience
that
s
both
restorative
and
restful
there
really
is
something
for
everyone
in
and
it
s
no
wonder
why
it
remains
so
popular
with
visitors
from
near
and
far
being
part
of
a
strong
productive
team
can
offer
a
range
of
advantages
and
create
an
atmosphere
of
mutual
support
making
tasks
much
more
enjoyable
working
in
a
group
brings
us
the
opportunity
to
brainstorm
collaborate
and
learn
from
each
other
s
knowledge
and
expertise
it
also
encourages
us
to
be
proactive
and
enhances
the
productivity
of
the
entire
team
i
can
certainly
vouch
for
this
during
my
years
in
college
i
worked
on
many
projects
in
small
teams
and
each
time
i
d
take
away
some
new
insight
or
valuable
knowledge
working
with
others
also
provided
an
atmosphere
of
accountability
where
members
could
help
each
other
stay
on
track
and
work
out
problems
together
outside
sources
can
also
provide
evidence
for
the
benefits
of
working
in
groups
according
to
a
study
by
s
for
teaching
when
a
student
works
in
a
group
they
can
often
come
up
with
insights
questions
and
explanations
that
they
might
not
have
thought
of
on
their
own
in
addition
peers
can
challenge
and
motivate
each
other
which
can
lead
to
higher quality
work
it
is
clear
then
that
group
work
can
be
an
incredibly
effective
and
important
learning
experience
for
all
parties
involved
having
students
of
different
ages
in
the
same
program
can
be
a
great
benefit
to
both
the
older
and
the
younger
students
older
students
can
help
to
mentor
and
guide
the
younger
students
providing
them
with
support
understanding
and
insight
that
a
classroom
setting
can
not
provide
for
example
the
younger
students
can
look
up
to
the
older
students
and
use
them
as
role
models
for
academic
and
social
behavior
at
the
same
time
the
older
students
can
challenge
the
younger
students
to
stretch
their
thinking
and
enhance
their
performance
the
arrangement
also
gives
the
younger
students
an
opportunity
to
gain
experience
and
professional
advice
from
someone
who
has
already
been
through
their
current
struggles
in
this
way
both
the
older
and
the
younger
students
could
benefit
through
increased
motivation
productivity
and
confidence
schooling
provides
many
benefits
which
can
further
contribute
to
improved
academic
performance
for
example
the
lack
of
distractions
found
in
a
traditional
classroom
setting
can
make
it
easier
for
students
to
focus
on
their
studies
and
better
absorb
the
material
students
can
work
at
their
own
pace
without
having
to
try
and
keep
up
with
their
peers
sleeping
schedules
which
can
be
fostered
by
online
schooling
can
also
help
improve
cognition
and
the
ability
to
concentrate
more
easily
resulting
in
a
better
understanding
of
material
additionally
the
convenience
factor
of
online
schooling
allows
students
to
access
materials
from
anywhere
with
an
internet
connection
meaning
they
can
study
from
anywhere
these
individual
benefits
of
online
schooling
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
students
academic
performance
the
power
of
the
imagination
is
often
highly
valued
and
revered
but
having
knowledge
can
be
far
more
beneficial
and
rewarding
many
may
think
that
a
person
with
a
big
imagination
may
be
seen
as
ungrounded
or
frivolous
and
that
can
lead
to
being
taken
less
seriously
in
certain
areas
particularly
in
the
realm
of
academics
this
can
lead
to
feeling
afraid
and
for
some
a
lack
of
confidence
in
their
abilities
having
knowledge
however
carries
different
connotations
with
knowledge
a
person
can
speak
more
confidently
in
conversations
and
be
able
to
demonstrate
their
understanding
or
expertise
in
a
subject
it
also
can
give
a
sense
of
security
knowing
that
having
understanding
can
make
situations
more
manageable
and
free
someone
from
fear
and
anxiety
in
short
knowledge
is
often
seen
with
more
respect
while
an
overactive
imagination
may
cause
a
person
to
be
seen
as
flighty
or
lacking
seriousness
for
these
reasons
it
is
better
to
have
knowledge
than
an
imagination
with
knowledge
one
can
go
far
navigating
through
conversations
and
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
different
topics
with
ease
intergenerational
learning
can
be
an
incredibly
beneficial
experience
for
both
younger
and
older
students
having
students
of
multiple
ages
working
together
encourages
collaboration
helps
instill
values
of
empathy
and
respect
and
engenders
a
sense
of
community
for
younger
students
this
type
of
learning
environment
can
provide
them
with
mentors
who
can
guide
and
inspire
them
older
students
have
a
holistic
view
of
life
and
can
provide
unique
perspectives
which
help
the
younger
children
learn
and
grow
learning
also
provides
positive
role
models
for
the
younger
students
giving
them
valuable
insight
into
topics
of
various
ages
and
stages
of
life
older
students
benefit
just
as
much
from
intergenerational
learning
studies
have
shown
that
this
type
of
learning
fosters
leadership
communication
and
problem solving
skills
in
the
older
students
it
also
helps
to
build
resilience
responsibility
and
appreciation
for
the
younger
generations
in
elementary
schools
in
for
example
older
students
have
been
creating
positive
experiences
for
the
younger
students
mentoring
them
in
math
and
literacy
and
even
providing
opportunities
to
engage
in
meaningful
conversations
about
topics
such
as
social
justice
through
this
program
the
younger
children
not
only
receive
support
from
their
mentors
but
also
have
the
opportunity
to
develop
confidence
and
skills
in
problem
solving
and
collaboration
overall
intergenerational
learning
is
an
invaluable
experience
that
can
benefit
both
younger
and
older
students
not
only
does
it
encourage
collaboration
and
empathy
but
it
also
provides
mentorship
and
leadership
opportunities
this
type
of
learning
has
the
potential
to
inspire
positive
change
in
communities
and
strengthen
bonds
between
generations
the
journey
to
success
is
often
fraught
with
failure
however
the
resilience
to
overcome
and
learn
from
set backs
will
be
the
mark
of
greatness
s
quote
of
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
illustrates
this
idea
perfectly
one
great
example
of
a
success
story
is
the
development
of
the
light
bulb
despite
numerous
prototypes
and
constant
failures
the
light
bulb
was
finally
brought
to
fruition
by
the
determination
and
enthusiasm
of
its
inventors
this
example
highlights
the
importance
of
enthusiasm
when
pursuing
goals
and
demonstrates
how
failure
can
be
a
valuable
asset
on
the
other
hand
the
tendency
to
listen
to
negative
feedback
from
others
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
an
individual
s
confidence
the
success
stories
of
those
who
refuse
to
be
deterred
by
set backs
serve
as
a
reminder
of
the
importance
of
focusing
on
personal
motivation
rather
than
the
opinions
of
others
in
recent
years
the
decision
to
take
four
years
of
high
school
as
opposed
to
three
has
become
increasingly
important
for
high
school
students
going
beyond
the
traditional
three year
track
in
high
school
can
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
for
students
besides
core
academic
courses
and
electives
a
four year
high
school
can
offer
students
classes
in
advanced
math
science
foreign
language
computer
science
and
physical
education
furthermore
the
extra
year
of
high
school
education
provides
the
opportunity
to
develop
skills
important
for
college
readiness
such
as
public
speaking
critical
thinking
and
problem solving
in
contrast
students
who
opt
for
the
three year
plan
put
a
great
deal
of
pressure
on
themselves
to
complete
their
high
school
education
more
quickly
although
this
may
save
students
an
extra
year
in
tuition
fees
it
also
causes
them
to
miss
out
on
the
same
courses
that
other
students
would
gain
from
the
fourth
year
moreover
students
may
face
the
challenge
of
having
to
fit
a
full
year
s
worth
of
coursework
into
a
three year
period
resulting
in
an
increased
workload
and
potential
burnout
ultimately
deciding
whether
to
pursue
a
three year
or
four year
track
in
high
school
can
be
a
challenging
decision
that
affects
a
student
s
academic
and
professional
future
with
that
in
mind
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
both
options
before
making
the
right
choice
working
four
days
a
week
for
an
extended
period
of
hours
can
be
beneficial
for
many
reasons
firstly
it
allows
for
increased
productivity
as
fewer
days
are
required
overall
to
complete
tasks
allowing
workers
more
time
to
recharge
and
be
motivated
when
at
work
additionally
it
also
provides
people
with
more
free
time
that
can
be
devoted
to
activities
such
as
hobbies
or
further
work
however
it
may
be
difficult
for
some
to
keep
up
a
consistent
amount
of
energy
for
ten hour
days
as
well
as
managing
daily
tasks
like
family
obligations
and
responsibilities
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
can
provide
students
with
more
time
for
learning
allowing
them
to
explore
more
topics
or
delve
deeper
into
existing
ones
this
can
offer
them
a
better
understanding
of
new
information
and
deepen
their
knowledge
overall
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
difficult
for
students
to
keep
their
attentions
going
for
two
extra
hours
particularly
those
who
may
be
struggling
with
certain
subjects
or
have
other
commitments
outside
of
school
immigrants
come
to
the
states
from
all
over
the
world
in
search
of
a
better
life
often
facing
difficult
odds
along
the
way
despite
these
odds
many
immigrants
persevere
and
build
successful
lives
in
their
new
home
for
example
is
an
immigrant
who
found
success
after
coming
to
the
states
from
an
advocate
for
health
education
and
communities
he
now
serves
in
s
another
inspiring
example
is
an
immigrant
from
who
overcame
language

immigrants
like
and
exemplify
the
unstoppable
resilience
of
those
who
come
to
the
states
and
are
determined
to
make
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families
they
demonstrate
the
truth
behind
s
statement
that
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
immigrants
do
not
give
up
despite
the
many
failures
and
obstacles
they
face
in
their
pursuit
of
a
better
life
it
is
this
remarkable
courage
and
determination
that
makes
immigrants
some
of
the
strongest
people
in
the
world
although
there
are
plentiful
excuses
for
students
not
to
attend
school
including
illness
family
trips
or
lack
of
interest
natural
disasters
and
other
issues
in
the
student
s
neighborhood
can
also
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
attend
the
impact
of
absences
and
making
up
an
entire
year
of
schooling
can
be
significantly
detrimental
to
a
student
s
academic
success
to
help
students
in
difficult
circumstances
one
solution
is
to
offer
distance
learning
opportunities
which
allows
students
to
stay
on
track
without
having
to
attend
in
person
however
many
argue
that
the
effectiveness
of
distance
learning
is
limited
compared
to
the
traditional
in person
classroom
setting
making
it
a
controversial
topic
ultimately
there
is
no
easy
answer
and
it
should
be
approached
differently
depending
on
the
specific
situation
when
making
decisions
it
can
be
useful
to
consider
advice
from
multiple
people
in
different
situations
as
it
can
help
provide
a
broad
perspective
having
multiple
viewpoints
can
help
identify
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
that
might
otherwise
be
overlooked
for
example
if
making
a
career
decision
receiving
advice
from
a
mentor
in
the
profession
a
current
colleague
and
a
former
classmate
who
once
pursued
the
same
option
can
provide
a
comprehensive
assessment
of
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
potential
option
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
drawbacks
to
receiving
and
considering
advice
from
too
many
different
people
having
multiple
perspectives
can
be
difficult
to
process
all
at
once
and
it
might
cause
confusion
and
conflicting
opinions
it
is
important
to
weigh
each
person
s
advice
carefully
or
else
it
could
create
too
much
doubt
or
indecision
when
making
a
choice
the
rise
of
distant
learning
has
had
a
massive
impact
on
students
in
recent
decades
with
the
increasing
influence
of
technology
on
today
s
generation
students
are
now
able
to
access
educational
content
and
resources
from
virtually
anywhere
taking
advantage
of
opportunities
that
were
n t
available
before
conferencing
has
enabled
teachers
to
have
face to face
interactions
with
their
students
even
at
a
distance
providing
that
important
personal
connection
that
can
often
be
missing
from
online
courses
on
top
of
this
students
have
the
potential
to
benefit
socially
and
educationally
from
distant
learning
with
virtual
classes
being
a
great
way
for
people
from
different
cultures
countries
and
backgrounds
to
connect
and
learn
as
remote
working
and
online
education
continues
to
increase
the
potential
benefits
of
distant
learning
for
students
only
looks
set
to
grow
being
successful
is
not
always
about
constantly
working
hard
sometimes
taking
a
break
and
being
inactive
can
reap
impressive
rewards
studies
show
that
taking
breaks
during
tests
or
long
work
hours
increases
productivity
comprehension
and
creativity
due
to
the
improved
performance
of
mental
processing
after
these
breaks
many
successful
entrepreneurs
have
credited
their
success
to
taking
a
break
in
the
midst
of
their
work
something
which
allowed
them
to
come
up
with
creative
solutions
to
problems
taking
a
break
from
work
for
both
physical
and
mental
rejuvenation
is
essential
for
success
as
it
can
often
lead
to
unexpected
and
innovative
ideas

according
to
respect
and
collaboration
are
integral
parts
of
any
successful
society
these
beliefs
of
s
still
resonate
today
especially
in
the
modern
workplace
as
technology
continues
to
advance
and
more
people
are
relying
on
collaborative
talents
it
is
essential
to
remember
the
lessons
that
taught
us
about
the
need
to
work
hard
and
treat
others
with
respect
people
of
all
backgrounds
need
to
come
together
to
ensure
that
we
are
able
to
effectively
and
efficiently
solve
any
issues
that
arise
of
course
mutual
respect
is
key
to
this
endeavor
the
sentiments
that
promoted
are
as
relevant
now
as
they
ve
ever
been
we
must
never
forget
the
importance
of
values
such
as
hard
work
and
respect
for
each
other
his
unwavering
commitment
to
ensuring
the
longevity
of
these
principles
can
continue
to
serve
us
and
help
us
move
towards
a
brighter
and
more
productive
future
it
is
important
to
be
true
to
yourself
and
to
be
honest
about
who
you
are
and
what
you
stand
for
in
a
world
full
of
people
who
try
to
blend
in
and
conform
it
is
important
to
stay
true
to
your
unique
identity
doing
hard
work
and
challenging
yourself
can
be
a
way
to
prove
who
you
are
and
to
build
confidence
in
yourself
personally
when
i
worked
hard
in
college
to
achieve
a
difficult
course
it
made
me
realize
that
with
the
right
effort
and
dedication
i
was
capable
of
anything
achieving
that
course
solidified
my
confidence
in
myself
and
pushed
me
to
follow
my
passions
i
now
feel
empowered
to
express
myself
freely
and
without
judgement
the
same
principle
can
be
applied
professionally
by
working
hard
to
exceed
expectations
i
am
able
to
show
that
i
am
trustworthy
and
dependable
and
that
i
take
my
work
seriously
doing
hard
work
at
my
job
has
also
opened
up
new
opportunities
for
my
career
and
has
allowed
me
to
advance
more
quickly
no
matter
what
the
context
is
i
believe
that
demonstrating
hard
work
and
staying
true
to
who
you
are
can
be
an
effective
way
to
show
yourself
and
the
world
that
you
are
capable
and
resilient
doing
so
can
not
only
benefit
you
but
can
help
to
inspire
those
around
you
too
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
an
incredibly
profound
effect
on
others
evidence
suggests
that
when
individuals
take
time
out
of
their
day
to
extend
compassion
and
help
towards
strangers
or
loved
ones
it
can
completely
transform
the
lives
of
those
that
receive
it
it
is
said
that
one
random
act
of
kindness
can
ripple
out
and
create
a
positive
impact
that
can
reach
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
people
an
example
of
this
can
be
seen
in
a
recent
online
story
of
a
man
named
was
out
for
a
jog
one
day
when
he
saw
an
elderly
woman
struggling
to
carry
her
shopping
bags
home
he
immediately
stopped
his
jog
and
offered
to
help
the
woman
carry
her
shopping
on
the
rest
of
her
journey
although
this
simple
act
of
kindness
initially
seemed
small
it
demonstrated
a
significant
amount
of
compassion
for
the
woman
in
response
to
his
act
of
kindness
the
woman
gave
a
hug
and
thanked
him
for
his
help
this
incident
shows
how
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
an
empowering
and
immediate
effect
on
those
around
us
the
power
of
kindness
is
an
emotion
and
force
that
should
never
be
underestimated
individuals
can
experience
long lasting
feelings
of
vulnerability
appreciation
warmth
or
well being
when
they
are
beneficiaries
of
a
kind
and
genuine
gesture
moreover
showing
kindness
to
others
is
a
powerful
way
of
connecting
with
them
on
an
emotional
level
that
can
create
lasting
bonds
and
long term
relationships
experiencing
kindness
in
the
form
of
words
recognition
or
appreciation
to
name
a
few
can
have
a
hugely
positive
impact
on
our
mindsets
and
sense
of
well being
in
summary
small
acts
of
kindness
have
the
potential
to
have
a
huge
impact
on
those
who
experience
them
they
often
emphasize
the
feeling
of
togetherness
between
individuals
and
also
restore
faith
in
humanity
examples
of
these
acts
can
range
from
holding
the
door
open
for
someone
offering
compliments
writing
someone
a
thank
you
note
or
simply
helping
a
stranger
in
need
whether
big
or
small
any
act
of
kindness
can
have
a
powerful
and
lasting
effect
on
both
parties
starting
a
homework
club
at
a
middle
school
could
be
beneficial
for
students
by
helping
them
stay
on
top
of
assignments
and
build
organizational
and
study
skills
with
all
members
of
the
club
in
the
same
age
group
students
could
feel
more
comfortable
collaborating
and
discussing
problems
together
time
could
be
a
challenge
as
students
often
have
a
variety
of
activities
they
are
involved
in
already
and
further
commitments
may
be
difficult
to
take
on
although
the
club
would
mostly
be
self directed
adult
supervision
or
guidance
would
be
necessary
to
keep
members
focused
and
on task
motivation
may
fluctuate
so
it
would
be
important
to
come
up
with
ways
to
keep
the
members
engaged
and
committed
to
participating
in
the
club
working
as
a
group
could
also
inspire
students
to
be
kinder
and
more
supportive
of
one
another
teaching
the
importance
of
collaboration
and
camaraderie
finally
volunteer
work
could
be
encouraged
for
members
who
put
in
extra
effort
or
help
the
members
who
may
be
struggling
with
the
right
approach
a
homework
club
could
be
a
great
way
for
students
to
learn
important
skills
and
stay
focused

a
long
and
rich
history
and
culture

any
challenge
into
an
opportunity
and
become
the
best
versions
of
ourselves

one
s
own
decisions
is
an
important
part
of
life
it
allows
us
to
be
independent
autonomous
and
ultimately
more
in
control
of
our
success
by
taking
ownership
of
our
decisions

are
able
to
make
better
choices
and
become
more
thoughtful
and
assertive
when
making
decisions
for
ourselves
we
are
able
to
avoid
external
influences
and
biases
that
may
not
work
in
our
best
interest

needs
and
desires

can
easily
see
why
something
did
n t
turn
out
in
the
way
we
had
planned
and
make
corrections
accordingly
this
helps
us
to
continue
to
grow
and
develop
rather
than
rely
on
other
people
to
tell
us
what
to
do
ultimately
when
people
make
their
own
decisions
they
gain
more
confidence
and
a
greater
sense
of
personal
satisfaction

increase
their
motivation
enabling
them
to
continue
reaching
higher
and
higher
goals
in
the
end
making
your
own
decisions
is
the
key
to
taking
control
of
your
life
and
your
future
working
together
in
a
group
has
many
benefits
when
compared
to
working
alone
which
can
make
a
bigger
impact
and
often
be
more
efficient
than
solitary
efforts
working
collaboratively
allows
everyone
to
contribute
their
own
ideas
skills
and
knowledge
to
a
project
creating
a
collective
hypothetical
pool
from
which
the
group
can
draw
the
combined
skillsets
of
the
members
provide
the
creative
and
technical
skills
necessary
to
achieve
a
goal
which
may
be
beyond
the
capability
of
any
individual
alone
ultimately
working
in
a
group
encourages
innovation
through
the
synthesis
of
multiple
points
of
view
resulting
in
fresh
ideas
and
problem solving
empowered
by
diversity
negotiations
between
members
within
the
group
can
also
motivate
creative
resolutions
trusted
strategic
counsel
and
the
ability
to
openly
exchange
opinions
without
fear
of
judgement
however
there
are
some
downsides
to
working
in
a
group
as
well
working
together
increases
the
likelihood
of
procrastination
and
delays
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
stay
on
track
making
it
essential
for
members
to
stay
on
task
and
dedicated
to
achieve
long term
objectives
in
addition
group
dynamics
and
differences
in
opinion
can
often
lead
to
competition
and
resentment
between
members
which
can
hinder
the
overall
project
s
effectiveness
while
working
alone
can
be
more
efficient
in
some
cases
it
can
be
more
limited
than
when
working
in
a
group
one
person
can
not
replicate
the
collective
creativity
that
true
collaboration
can
provide
and
in
most
cases
an
individual
s
work
will
remain
somewhat
confined
to
what
they
already
know
working
alone
can
also
create
a
sense
of
isolation
and
it
can
be
difficult
for
an
individual
to
stay
motivated
and
productive
without
the
extra
support
of
group
members
in
conclusion
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
both
group
and
solo
work
it
is
important
for
teams
to
recognize
the
advantages
of
each
approach
and
understand
when
it
s
beneficial
to
work
together
or
independently
in
order
to
get
work
done
efficiently
and
effectively
in
today

modern
society

has
had
a
lasting
and
positive
impact

has
enabled
us
to
be
more
connected
than
ever
before

communication
and
giving
us
access
to
vast
amounts
of
information
without
ever
having
to
leave

its
use
in
medical
breakthroughs
and
scientific
exploration
to
its
presence
in
various
markets
there
is
no
denying
the
many
ways
that

the
use
of

can
provide
people
with

opportunities
and
the
tools
they
need
to
solve
complex
problems
in
short
the
effects
of
technology
on
our
society
are
significant
and
the
landscape
of
its
applications
and
functions
continues
to
evolve
with
its
help
we
have
been
able
to
better
navigate
the
ever changing
world
and
maximize
our
potential
on
both
a
personal
and
sociological
level
having
a
positive
attitude

been
long
seen
to
be
a
contributing
factor
in
achieving
success
numerous
examples
abound
that
demonstrate
how
individuals
have
used
their
optimism
and
determination
to
triumph
over
difficult
situations
and
accomplish
their
goals

eventually
she
was
able
to
achieve
her
dream
of
launching
her
own
line
of
luxury
clothing
that
women
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
had
access
to
this
meant
challenging
the
conventional
thinking
of
the
industry
has
been
an
example
of
the
positive
power
that
comes
from
becoming
a
self made

the
modern
world
is
becoming
increasingly
technology
focused
especially
in
regards
to
communication
and
interactions
this
rise
in
technology
and
use
of
digital
tools
has
had
significant
effects
on
physical
activity
mental
health
and
social
interactions
for
both
children
and
adults
has
shown
that
increased
time
on
sedentary
electronic
activities
has
been
linked
to
lower
levels
of
physical
activity
higher
risk
of
anxiety
and
depression
and
decreased
social
capability
associated
with
ordering

online
include
potential
health
hazards
due
to
mishandling
of
the
food
and
even
theft
of
personal
information
bullying
is
a
major
issue
of
modern
times
which
can
have
major
consequences
such
as
decreased
self esteem
a
heightened
risk
of
depression
and
in
some
extreme
cases
suicide
despite
these
unavoidable
risks
associated
with
technology
mobile
devices
and
software
updates
can
be
used
to
positively
influence
people
s
lives
particularly
through
coordinated
communication
with
family
and
friends
both
domestically
and
abroad
however
using
a
mobile
device
to
communicate
abroad
can
introduce
risks
of
large
financial
complications
due
to
high
international
rates
is
an
important
task
that
can
have
significant
consequences
in
our
lives
both
positive
and
negative
seeking
advice
from
loved
ones
or
a
professional
can
help
people
make
confident
decisions
and
understand
their
options
and
outcomes
taking
the
time
to
trust
one
s
own
judgement
is
also
vital
as
well
as
developing
strong
decision making
skills
at
an
early
age
the
benefits
of
good
decision making
can
bring
profound
improvements
to
our
lives
our
future
and
our
families
being
able
to
make
quick
and
wise
decisions
can
help
us
work
toward
our
goals
and
achieve
our
potential
in
the
long
run
growing
up
i
faced
many
problems
and
hard
times
whenever
i
encountered
a
difficult
situation
i
saw
it
as
an
opportunity
for
self improvement
and
personal
growth
i
believed
that
if
i
could
just
push
through
it
i
would
come
out
stronger
on
the
other
side
this
philosophy
has
served
me
well
throughout
my
life
and
is
something
i
encourage
everyone
to
embrace
i
have
always
viewed
my
problems
as
a
chance
for
me
to
do
my
best
instead
of
being
overwhelmed
and
defeated
by
them
i
try
to
remain
focused
and
look
for
solutions
by
taking
this
approach
i
have
learned
how
to
be
resilient
and
determined
and
am
constantly
striving
to
become
better
times
can
also
be
a
great
teacher
when
struggles
arise
it
s
an
opportunity
to
develop
resilience
and
learn
from
the
experience
i
ve
learned
that
it
s
essential
to
be
able
to
pick
myself
up
and
keep
moving
forward
no
matter
what
life
throws
my
way
as
someone
who
has
struggled
in
the
past
i
know
first hand
how
hard
times
can
build
up
strength
additionally
hard
issues
can
show
someone
how
to
make
better
decisions
in
the
future
it
s
important
to
be
able
to
take
a
step
back
assess
the
situation
and
come
up
with
a
way
to
prevent
the
same
problem
from
occurring
again
with
this
understanding
i
have
been
able
to
make
thoughtful
decisions
and
have
avoided
repeating
the
same
mistakes
in
conclusion
i
believe
that
problems
can
be
a
meaningful
chance
to
do
your
best
hard
times
can
build
up
strength
and
issues
can
show
someone
how
to
do
better
in
the
future
through
my
own
experiences
i
have
learned
that
these
challenges
can
be
difficult
to
overcome
but
they
can
also
be
used
to
benefit
and
better
oneself
after
spending
time
researching
various
career
options
i
discovered
a
career
that
not
only
appealed
to
my
skills
and
interests
but
also
fit
my
long term
goals
to
gain
further
insight
into
the
specifics
of
this
career
i
contacted
people
who
were
already
working
within
the
field
in
order
to
learn
more
about
what
was
required
of
them
and
the
skills
they
had
developed
in
order
to
be
successful
during
my
conversations
i
discovered
the
courses
i
could
take
in
order
to
gain
the
knowledge
and
skills
needed
to
make
me
a
top
candidate
for
this
field
through
all
of
my
research
i
determined
that
this
career
path
was
the
perfect
match
for
me
the
combination
of
my
skills
and
interests
along
with
the
knowledge
i
had
gained
from
speaking
to
people
in
this
field
confirmed
this
in
my
essay
i
will
explain
why
this
career
path
is
the
right
choice
for
me
and
how
i
can
use
the
resources
available
to
me
to
gain
the
necessary
skills
and
experience
to
pursue
it
successfully
while
online
classes
offer
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
access
course
materials
and
lectures
without
having
to
attend
in person
classes
they
can
also
have
some
disadvantages
for
students
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
with
virtual
learning
is
that
it
is
easy
to
get
distracted
and
not
pay
attention
for
the
duration
of
the
lecture
this
can
cause
students
to
miss
important
points
and
comprehension
of
the
material
being
discussed
not
taking
notes
can
also
have
a
negative
effect
on
learning
as
it
is
critical
for
students
to
capture
all
relevant
information
and
ideas
from
the
lecture
to
be
able
to
process
it
later
online
classes
can
be
difficult
for
some
students
because
of
the
self discipline
that
is
required
in
order
to
effectively
learn
and
retain
information
furthermore
the
lack
of
face to face
interaction
can
make
it
more
difficult
to
build
a
sense
of
community
within
the
classroom
which
can
be
beneficial
to
many
students
additionally
it
can
be
difficult
to
have
meaningful
discussions
with
classmates
over
the
internet
which
can
limit
opportunities
for
critical
thinking
and
collaboration
overall
while
online
classes
have
the
potential
to
provide
students
with
convenience
and
flexibility
when
it
comes
to
their
education
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
as
well
if
students
are
unable
to
stay
focused
and
take
notes
they
may
not
get
the
full
educational
experience
that
is
available
in
an
in person
setting
furthermore
the
lack
of
face to face
interaction
can
make
it
more
difficult
for
students
to
build
meaningful
connections
consequently
online
classes
may
not
be
a
beneficial
choice
for
all
students
recent
studies
suggest
that
the
benefits
of
engaging
in
active
activities
far
exceed
the
advantages
of
staying
inactive
active
activities
involve
engaging
in
physical
or
mental
activities
that
encourage
interaction
with
others
and
direct
involvement
with
the
environment
participating
in
activities
such
as
sports
volunteer
work
or
creative
endeavors
has
been
found
to
lead
to
increased
productivity
better
physical
health
and
improved
cognitive
functioning
conversely
the
drawbacks
of
inactive
activities
can
leave
individuals
feeling
unfulfilled
and
out
of
touch
with
reality
in
contrast
inactive
activities
such
as
reading
listening
to
music
watching
television
and
playing
video
games
can
serve
a
purpose
in
people
s
lives
these
activities
can
provide
valuable
rest
and
relaxation
allowing
people
to
recharge
after
a
difficult
day
or
and
to
gain
a
new
perspective
in
addition
accomplishments
can
be
found
within
these
activities
a
person
can
strive
to
finish
a
book
series
or
learn
how
to
play
a
musical
instrument
furthermore
this
type
of
activity
can
help
to
develop
mental
skills
such
as
problem solving
as
well
as
aiding
the
development
of
physical
skills
like
hand eye
coordination
taking
risks
and
facing
fears
can
be
a
necessary
part
of
learning
and
progressing
and
anxiety
can
help
spur
on
growth
and
innovation
and
can
even
be
helpful
in
strengthening
relationships
however
the
consequences
of
taking
risks
can
be
anything
from
exhilaration
to
disappointment
so
it
s
important
to
weigh
the
risks
and
rewards
before
deciding
whether
or
not
to
take
a
risk
overall
understanding
the
consequences
of
taking
risks
versus
staying
inactive
can
help
us
better
prepare
for
success
knowing
when
to
take
a
risk
and
when
to
stay
safe
has
a
great
impact
on
our
daily
lives
and
can
help
us
achieve
both
short term
and
long term
goals
knowing
when
and
how
to
properly
take
risks
and
push
through
fears
can
open
new
doors
and
lead
us
to
a
better
future
i
have
always
been
interested
in
the
field
of
in
high
school
i
had
the
opportunity
to
attend
a
variety
of
seminars
and
lectures
on
the
subject
and
it
was
one
of
my
greatest
sources
of
inspiration
i
am
fascinated
with
the
complexity
and
fascinating
human
behavior
and
i
am
passionate
about
helping
people
not
only
does
this
field
provide
the
opportunity
to
understand
why
people
think
and
behave
the
way
they
do
but
it
also
offers
the
potential
to
help
create
positive
changes
in
people
s
lives
in
order
to
pursue
this
career
path
i
have
been
working
hard
to
mature
my
mind
and
develop
my
knowledge
and
skills
that
can
be
applied
in
this
field
moreover
i
have
taken
the
initiative
to
explore
different
passions
and
hobbies
that
can
help
me
develop
a
well rounded
personality
and
be
prepared
to
embark
on
this
journey
with
a
combination
of
learning
maturing
my
mind
and
developing
my
passions
i
am
confident
that
i
will
be
able
to
pursue
a
career
in
receiving
praise
and
recognition
for
academic
successes
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
a
student
s
self esteem
studies
have
shown
that
when
students
are
praised
they
feel
empowered
and
more
likely
to
be
successful
in
the
future
additionally
experiences
of
praise
and
accomplishment
can
raise
a
student
s
self image
providing
a
sense
of
pride
and
confidence
the
development
of
strong
self esteem
is
essential
in
fostering
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
and
confidence
positive
feedback
and
accomplishments
can
open
a
student
to
further
success
and
help
them
recognize
their
own
potential
ultimately
by
emphasizing
positive
reinforcement
and
making
achievements
known
we
can
help
reinforce
positive
mental
health
and
productivity
in
our
students
the
president
of
the
once
famously
said
that
i
m
a
great
believer
in
luck
and
i
find
the
harder
i
work
the
more
i
have
of
it
people
have
taken
this
quote
to
heart
and
emphasize
the
importance
of
setting
and
working
towards
goals
however
there
are
some
people
who
believe
that
setting
goals
can
lead
to
disappointment
and
that
one
should
not
put
too
much
stock
in
trying
to
achieve
something
it
is
undeniable
however
that
setting
a
goal
helps
to
focus
and
motivate
people
there
are
countless
anecdotes
of
people
who
have
achieved
something
incredible
by
setting
a
goal
for
example
the
actress
who
achieved
worldwide
success
playing
set
a
goal
when
she
was
just
a
teenager
and
never
stopped
working
to
achieve
it
similarly
once
struggled
with
depression
but
set
the
goal
of
writing
a
book
which
became
the
beloved
series
the
reasons
why
some
people
set
easier
goals
while
others
set
more
difficult
ones
vary
from
person
to
person
sometimes
the
decision
to
set
a
more
or
less
difficult
goal
is
based
on
the
individual
s
risk
profile
other
times
it
is
based
on
personal
experience
of
what
has
or
has
not
worked
in
the
past
no
matter
how
hard
or
easy
the
goal
may
be
it
is
those
that
try
hard
and
work
hard
that
achieve
something
people
like
and
countless
others
have
achieved
something
by
keeping
their
eyes
on
the
prize
and
working
hard
strategies
that
have
been
effective
for
these
individuals
include
staying
focused
continuously
learning
and
never
giving
up
showing
what
one
can
accomplish
certainly
has
an
impact
it
can
inspire
and
motivate
proving
to
somebody
that
anything
is
possible
with
hard
work
and
dedication
it
also
serves
as
an
example
of
the
importance
of
setting
and
working
towards
goals
expressing
emotions
is
a
crucial
part
of
life
it
allows
us
to
put
into
words
how
we
feel
and
gives
us
an
outlet
to
build
meaningful
relationships
however
sometimes
expressing
these
emotions
can
be
difficult
especially
when
we
feel
shy
about
what
we
are
trying
to
express
in
these
situations
we
can
lack
confidence
in
ourselves
and
in
our
ability
to
say
or
do
what
we
want
we
may
feel
embarrassed
scared
or
find
it
difficult
to
trust
ourselves
to
communicate
in
the
right
way
these
emotions
can
overwhelm
us
and
prevent
us
from
confidently
expressing
ourselves
fortunately
there
are
techniques
that
can
help
us
overcome
these
fears
and
anxieties
to
communicate
our
emotions
with
conviction
it
is
important
to
have
a
supportive
group
of
friends
and
family
who
will
accept
us
for
who
we
are
and
provide
understanding
and
encouragement
as
we
work
to
express
ourselves
in
addition
taking
the
time
to
really
think
about
what
we
want
to
express
and
how
we
want
to
express
it
can
help
us
to
overcome
feelings
of
shyness
and
lack
of
confidence
by
planning
what
we
want
to
say
we
can
go
into
any
situation
with
the
confidence
and
determination
to
express
ourselves
in
a
meaningful
and
clear
way
learning
how
to
express
ourselves
and
our
emotions
is
an
essential
part
of
life
but
it
can
be
intimidating
when
we
fear
rejection
or
lack
confidence
in
ourselves
with
the
right
level
of
support
and
planning
we
can
confidently
express
our
emotions
and
our
thoughts
without
being
held
back
by
fear
and
shyness
growing
up
i
was
convinced
that
if
i
changed
my
hair
my
clothes
or
my
accent
then
i
would
be
cool
i
thought
it
would
make
me
popular
and
likeable
i
remember
going
to
a
new
school
and
desperately
trying
to
fit
in
i
tried
to
mimic
the
girls
that
were
popular
in
my
class
thinking
that
if
i
act
like
them
i
would
be
accepted
after
months
of
trying
to
change
myself
i
realized
that
it
only
made
me
feel
worse
about
myself
i
had
stopped
being
true
to
myself
and
it
had
made
me
feel
like
a
phony
a
friend
of
mine
shared
a
story
with
me
that
resonated
with
how
i
was
feeling
he
told
me
the
story
of
a
caterpillar
who
wanted
to
be
a
different
color
so
it
kept
trying
to
change
its
spots
in
the
end
the
caterpillar
realized
that
beauty
came
from
within
and
it
became
happy
with
its
true
nature
the
moral
of
the
story
is
the
importance
of
being
yourself
and
not
trying
to
be
something
that
you
are
not
people
like
us
for
who
we
are
not
for
who
we
pretend
to
be
if
we
are
authentic
and
embody
our
true
selves
we
will
feel
more
content
and
more
comfortable
in
our
own
skin
in
the
end
it
is
better
to
be
proud
of
who
you
are
than
to
pretend
to
be
somebody
else
therefore
it
is
important
to
always
be
true
to
yourself
do
not
try
to
force
yourself
into
being
someone
that
you
are
not
life
will
be
a
lot
more
enjoyable
and
fulfilling
when
you
embrace
who
you
are
it
is
not
easy
but
it
is
necessary
to
be
yourself
and
be
comfortable
in
who
you
are
always
be
true
to
you
we
all
have
our
own
philosophies
on
life
and
how
we
should
live
it
seemed
to
suggest
that
being
idle
was
not
ideal
famously
saying
never
to
be
idle
while
this
can
be
excellent
advice
it
is
also
important
to
balance
it
by
embracing
the
value
of
doing
nothing
once
in
a
while
doing
something
productive
all
the
time
can
lead
to
overwhelming
stress
and
exhaustion
that
can
set
us
back
further
as
opposed
to
moving
us
forward
this
inactivity
can
produce
a
welcome
relief
that
can
give
us
the
mental
break
needed
to
come
back
feeling
relaxed
and
ready
to
grab
the
reins
of
life
again
it
is
important
to
not
fall
into
the
trap
of
a
lazy
routine
doing
something
productive
every
now
and
then
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
taking
time
to
work
on
our
passions
helping
out
a
friend
investing
in
our
own
learning
these
are
all
examples
of
meaningful
and
useful
activities
that
can
help
us
develop
however
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
doing
nothing
can
provide
the
same
benefits
taking
a
break
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
our
busy
lives
can
allow
us
to
unwind
take
stock
of
what
s
important
cultivate
creativity
and
more
it
is
clear
that
both
doing
something
and
nothing
have
their
own
important
merits
while
s
advice
to
determine
never
to
be
idle
can
be
sound
it
is
essential
that
we
remember
to
factor
in
the
importance
of
taking
a
break
in
both
an
active
and
inactive
form
in
doing
so
we
can
enjoy
a
balanced
lifestyle
and
find
a
healthy
equilibrium
between
our
activities
and
inactivity
it
is
important
for
people
to
take
their
own
decisions
in
life
rather
than
relying
on
the
opinions
of
others
people
with
self reliance
are
able
to
think
and
act
for
themselves
and
are
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
whatever
choices
they
make
are
guided
by
their
own
intuition
they
have
the
courage
to
pursue
their
own
vision
and
the
strength
of
character
to
make
decisions
even
if
those
decisions
are
unpopular
unfortunately
many
people
are
scared
of
taking
their
own
decisions
for
fear
of
failure
and
embarrassment
they
worry
that
if
they
make
the
wrong
choice
they
will
be
judged
negatively
by
other
people
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
making
mistakes
is
a
natural
part
of
life
and
can
have
many
positive
outcomes
by
having
the
courage
to
take
their
own
decisions
people
can
learn
valuable
lessons
and
gain
more
self confidence
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
for
people
to
take
their
own
decisions
in
life
rather
than
relying
solely
on
the
opinions
of
others
by
letting
go
of
the
fear
of
making
mistakes
and
having
the
courage
to
trust
their
intuition
people
can
learn
and
grow
from
their
own
decisions
with
the
introduction
of
a
school
day
that
is
one
and
a
half
hours
longer
students
and
their
families
stand
to
benefit
from
the
increased
educational
opportunities
for
students
a
longer
day
could
result
in
better
academic
performance
as
they
are
provided
with
additional
access
to
help
and
guidance
from
teachers
furthermore
this
longer
school
day
could
provide
students
with
more
resources
to
aid
in
their
learning
such
as
extra
curricular
activities
that
promote
individual
growth
or
study
groups
and
labs
to
help
improve
their
understanding
of
challenging
topics
with
the
additional
resources
students
could
take
more
initiative
in
their
own
education
which
could
lead
to
increased
satisfaction
in
learning
on
the
other
hand
longer
school
days
could
lead
to
teachers
and
students
feeling
overwhelmed
with
the
extra
time
spent
in
the
classroom
the
increased
workload
associated
with
the
extra
one
and
a
half
hours
might
lead
to
a
decline
in
student
motivation
and
engagement
in
the
lessons
additionally
many
students
might
struggle
to
keep
up
with
the
same
rigorous
schedule
everyday
hampering
their
ability
to
learn
effectively
despite
the
potential
disadvantages
of
having
a
one
and
a
half
hour
school
day
there
are
many
potential
benefits
that
could
result
from
this
extension
in
the
day
these
benefits
not
only
include
improved
academic
performance
for
students
but
also
the
convenience
for
their
families
having
a
longer
school
day
could
provide
parents
with
more
free
time
in
their
day
as
their
children
are
given
ample
time
to
complete
their
work
and
learn
new
skills
this
could
be
invaluable
for
families
with
multiple
responsibilities
and
could
result
in
a
greater
sense
of
satisfaction
for
everyone
involved
how
the
pros
and
cons
balance
out
depend
on
the
specific
school
environment
still
a
one
and
a
half
hour
school
day
could
reap
great
benefits
for
those
who
are
willing
to
give
it
a
try
moral
values
and
social
classes
play
an
integral
role
in
the
formation
of
a
person
s
character
as
an
individual
s
life
progresses
these
characteristics
take
on
different
meanings
and
meanings
ultimately
contributing
to
personal
growth
identity
and
decisions
morals
are
the
values
that
we
have
developed
throughout
our
lives
and
that
guide
us
in
decision
making
they
shape
our
conscience
and
give
us
direction
in
moments
of
doubt
or
struggle
in
addition
they
inform
us
of
our
beliefs
attitudes
and
preferences
for
example
a
moral
principle
such
as
not
stealing
can
discourage
a
person
from
taking
shortcuts
or
engaging
in
other
criminal
activities
in
essence
morals
are
the
compass
of
our
lives
which
leads
us
in
making
good
character
decisions
class
also
plays
a
role
in
how
a
person
s
character
is
formed
people
from
different
social
classes
may
have
different
sets
of
morals
and
values
due
to
their
different
upbringings
and
backgrounds
for
example
someone
who
grew
up
in
a
wealthy
family
may
have
a
different
view
of
debating
than
someone
who
was
raised
in
a
low income
household
how
one
perceives
these
different
codes
of
conduct
dictates
one
s
character
finally
the
people
that
a
person
surrounds
themselves
with
have
a
significant
influence
on
their
character
people
who
are
surrounded
by
positive
and
strong
influences
in
their
lives
tend
to
have
higher
self esteem
and
are
less
susceptible
to
acting
prematurely
or
rashly
moreover
they
learn
from
the
example
of
the
people
around
them
and
can
learn
how
to
handle
different
situations
and
what
to
expect
when
in
different
scenarios
in
conclusion
morals
social
class
and
people
are
all
key
contributors
to
the
formation
of
a
person
s
character
everyone
has
different
values
and
experiences
that
shape
the
person
they
become
and
it
is
important
to
take
the
time
to
recognize
how
these
elements
create
who
we
are
my
aunt
has
always
been
a
crucial
part
of
my
life
from
an
early
age
her
words
of
wisdom
and
years
of
experience
have
shaped
the
way
i
look
at
the
world
and
how
i
make
decisions
growing
up
she
was
the
first
to
tell
me
never
to
give
up
and
to
remember
that
it
is
ok
to
make
mistakes
with
her
sage
advice
she
taught
me
that
mistakes
give
you
the
opportunity
to
grow
and
to
learn
one
of
the
most
vivid
examples
of
her
advice
was
when
i
started
to
become
overwhelmed
with
all
of
the
opportunities
in
front
of
me
when
studying
for
college
she
told
me
to
just
take
things
one
step
at
a
time
and
to
remember
that
the
choices
i
make
do
not
have
to
be
permanent
she
reminded
me
to
never
give
up
and
to
keep
pushing
through
even
when
faced
with
uncertainty
the
wisdom
my
aunt
has
shared
with
me
has
been
integral
in
how
i
live
my
life
i
often
reflect
on
her
words
of
advice
particularly
when
i
am
in
the
process
of
making
a
decision
her
support
has
helped
me
find
my
own
inner
strength
as
i
have
come
to
the
realization
that
it
is
alright
to
make
mistakes
ultimately
her
guidance
has
been
invaluable
to
my
formation
as
an
individual
and
i
am
grateful
for
all
of
the
life
lessons
she
has
given
me
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
can
be
a
difficult
decision
to
make
for
a
student
and
their
family
while
some
may
view
this
decision
as
simply
saving
a
year
of
schooling
there
are
a
variety
of
factors
to
consider
including
workload
cost
and
potential
future
opportunities
the
workload
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
would
likely
require
students
to
take
more
courses
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
this
would
make
it
especially
difficult
for
students
who
may
struggle
academically
or
those
who
are
involved
in
competitive
extracurriculars
additionally
this
could
also
impede
the
quality
of
a
student
s
academic
performance
considering
the
shorter
time
to
complete
each
class
the
cost
graduating
in
three
years
would
likely
require
students
to
pay
extra
for
the
extra
classes
or
accelerated
courses
families
may
also
be
burdened
by
the
additional
costs
such
as
textbooks
tuition
and
transportation
fees
finally
the
opportunities
it
is
fair
to
critique
that
choosing
the
three year
option
may
limit
a
student
s
opportunities
in
the
future
although
this
decision
has
the
potential
to
shave
a
year
off
of
a
high
school
career
college
acceptance
is
generally
dependent
on
credits
completed
and
the
courses
taken
in
addition
students
who
do
not
take
the
traditional
four year
route
may
find
it
difficult
to
stand
out
among
competitors
who
are
more
experienced
in
their
fields
in
conclusion
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
is
a
decision
that
should
not
be
taken
lightly
both
of
the
options
have
advantages
and
disadvantages
which
must
be
considered
before
a
student
makes
the
right
decision
that
best
suits
their
needs
i
m
looking
forward
to
visiting
for
a
week long
adventure
i
m
planning
to
explore
all
the
attractions
events
and
restaurants
the
city
has
to
offer
i
m
really
excited
to

also
hoping
to
uncover
some
of
my
family
s
history
while
i
m
there
having
looked
into
family
records
i
believe
i
have
a
connection
to
the
area
so
i
m
looking
forward
to
exploring
the
city
visiting
the
places
my
ancestors
may
have
lived
and
experienced
and
finding
out
how
exactly
my
family
ties
into
the
history
of
i
know
this
will
be
an
amazing
trip
full
of
memorable
experiences
it
s
sure
to
be
a
taste
of
adventure
history
and
culture
i
ll
never
forget
graduating
from
high
school
earlier
than
usual
can
be
a
very
beneficial
experience
for
a
high
school
student
with
the
added
motivation
to
completing
their
studies
students
who
opt
to
finish
school
early
can
take
pride
in
their
sense
of
responsibility
and
accomplishment
aside
from
the
personal
satisfaction
graduating
earlier
has
the
potential
to
bring
positive
changes
to
the
student
s
family
and
even
society
at
large
students
graduating
early
can
do
their
part
in
contributing
to
the
family
with
the
knowledge
they
have
learned
from
completing
high
school
early
they
can
help
support
their
families
both
financially
and
mentally
they
can
use
their
diplomas
to
land
jobs
thus
bringing
in
a
steady
income
and
can
even
provide
emotional
support
to
their
families
from
the
maturity
that
comes
with
responsibility
moreover
students
graduating
early
can
stay
positive
and
confident
as
they
move
towards
their
future
knowing
that
they
have
achieved
success
by
completing
school
early
gives
them
relief
and
encouragement
that
they
can
do
the
same
in
meeting
future
goals
coupled
with
the
strong
support
system
of
their
family
these
students
can
improve
their
quality
of
life
by
keeping
a
good
attitude
and
setting
achievable
goals
by
graduating
from
high
school
earlier
than
usual
students
can
make
a
positive
contribution
to
their
families
and
society
despite
the
hard
work
and
dedication
necessary
to
take
on
this
challenge
the
rewards
of
experiencing
accomplishment
and
success
can
make
the
experience
worthwhile
in
addition
with
proper
guidance
and
support
from
their
families
these
students
can
stay
positive
and
stay
confident
as
they
face
their
future
whenever
we
make
a
decision
or
try
to
understand
something
it
s
often
helpful
to
speak
to
more
than
one
person
for
their
opinions
and
advice
by
doing
this
we
can
learn
new
things
make
better
decisions
and
get
help
when
we
need
it
for
example
let
s
say
you
re
facing
a
tough
decision
about
which
university
to
attend
by
reaching
out
to
multiple
people
such
as
current
students
at
the
universities
admissions
counsellors
and
family
and
friends
you
can
get
a
good
sense
of
what
each
university
has
to
offer
and
which
one
might
be
the
best
fit
for
you
through
this
process
you
gain
a
well rounded
understanding
of
the
benefits
of
each
university
and
make
an
educated
decision
first
impressions
are
powerful
and
have
a
lasting
effect
they
can
shape
opinions
and
perceptions
and
are
especially
difficult
to
change
studies
have
found
that
overall
first
impressions
tend
to
be
positive
yet
there
can
be
exceptions
where
they
are
determined
to
be
negative
moreover
it
can
be
extremely
difficult
to
shift
this
initial
opinion
as
firmly
crafted
perceptions
are
hard
to
move
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
even
when
someone
s
thoughts
on
a
subject
are
initially
negative
it
is
possible
to
change
them
through
open
discussion
and
open
mindedness
for
example
if
a
person
has
a
preconceived
notion
about
a
particular
restaurant
s
cuisine
providing
a
positive
or
enlightening
experience
allows
for
a
shift
in
their
opinion
even
when
a
first
impression
is
impossible
to
change
there
is
potential
for
it
to
be
turned
into
a
more
positive
outlook
one
activity
that
can
be
both
enjoyable
and
educational
is
cooking
learning
about
different
ingredients
recipes
and
cooking
techniques
is
not
only
a
great
way
to
learn
about
nutrition
but
can
also
be
a
fun
and
creative
process
for
example
someone
could
make
their
own
pizza
from
scratch
they
can
select
from
a
variety
of
different
toppings
and
sauces
experiment
with
different
baking
techniques
and
taste
the
delicious
results
at
the
end
a
second
activity
that
could
be
both
enjoyable
and
educational
is
gardening
is
a
great
way
to
learn
about
plants
soil
and
the
environment
an
individual
could
start
a
garden
of
their
own
and
see
the
results
come
to
life
as
they
learn
how
to
care
and
nurture
the
plants
it
can
even
be
fun
to
try
out
different
planting
strategies
such
as
companion
planting
and
to
see
the
results
for
yourself
finally
learning
a
new
language
can
be
both
enjoyable
and
educational
with
the
internet
and
so
many
apps
and
websites
dedicated
to
language
learning
learning
a
new
language
is
more
accessible
than
ever
by
studying
a
new
language
you
can
learn
about
new
cultures
and
even
new
words
to
use
in
conversations
plus
you
can
make
it
enjoyable
by
setting
small
and
achievable
goals
and
then
rewarding
yourself
when
you
hit
them
being
an
actively
engaged
student
can
have
significant
benefits
for
both
an
individual
s
academic
and
future
prospects
not
only
does
it
provide
a
student
the
opportunity
to
gain
new
knowledge
and
skills
it
also
allows
them
to
form
connections
with
faculty
and
peers
that
can
help
later
in
life
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
of
being
an
actively
engaged
student
is
the
chance
to
develop
critical
thinking
skills
when
a
student
actively
participates
in
class
they
are
provided
with
the
opportunity
to
practice
their
independent
research
problem solving
and
communication
skills
these
are
key
skills
that
employers
are
now
seeking
making
actively
engaged
students
more
desirable
candidates
when
it
comes
to
job
opportunities
another
benefit
of
being
an
actively
engaged
student
is
gaining
the
ability
to
take
a
more
active
role
in
classroom
discussions
contributing
to
the
conversation
can
help
a
student
develop
a
deeper
and
more
meaningful
understanding
of
the
topics
being
discussed
as
well
as
build
important
interpersonal
skills
such
as
communication
collaboration
and
leadership
the
benefits
of
being
an
actively
engaged
student
extend
beyond
the
academic
realm
such
students
have
the
opportunity
to
form
valuable
connections
with
professors
and
peers
that
may
lead
to
furthering
their
studies
or
employment
opportunities
down
the
road
developing
these
relationships
can
be
especially
helpful
in
the
job
search
process
as
potential
employers
often
check
a
person
s
references
before
making
a
job
offer
in
conclusion
being
an
actively
engaged
student
provides
many
benefits
both
academically
and
professionally
those
who
take
the
time
to
participate
in
classroom
discussions
and
build
relationships
with
faculty
and
peers
are
sure
to
reap
the
rewards
in
the
long
run
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
classrooms
has
been
met
with
both
excitement
and
trepidation
on
one
hand
phones
can
be
used
to
enrich
the
learning
process
think
using
codes
for
extra
resources
checking
in
with
remote
students
or
offering
self directed
learning
opportunities
on
the
other
hand
allowing
phones
in
classrooms
has
the
potential
for
distraction
students
can
become
anxious
about
their
friends
texting
them
or
even
worse
wasting
class
time
on
social
media
or
gaming
it
is
up
to
the
educators
to
decide
if
the
pros
outweigh
the
cons
in
their
own
contexts
many
students
face
the
challenge
of
deciding
whether
to
work
on

the
advantages
of
students
working
alone
such
as
improved
time
management
better
focus
and
self challenging
in
terms
of
time
management
working
alone
is
a
great
way
to
stay
on
task
and
use
one
s
time
wisely
when
working
in
groups
there
is
always
the
potential
for
one
s
time
to
be
wasted
due
to
slim
productivity
from
other
group
members
or
sidetracking
conversations
when
working

however
students
can
set
their
own
pace
and
dedicate
their
time
to
their
own
tasks
accordingly
without
interruption
with
respect
to
focus
working
alone
can
also
help
ensure
that
students
are
best
able

use
their
attention
on
their
own
studies
rather
than
be
distracted
by
others

the
group
working

enables
students
to
stay
in
their

keep
distractions
and
extraneous
conversations

presents
the
opportunity
for
self challenging
it
can
be
difficult
to
hold
oneself
accountable
to
do
more
than
what
is
asked
of
them
but
working
alone
provides
the
motivation
to
go
above
and
beyond
with
no
one
around
to
rely
on
taking
the
initiative
to
add
to
the
project
is
crucial
in
conclusion
working
alone
has
many
advantages
for
students
it
allows
for
improved
time
management
better
focus
and
self challenging
all
of
these
elements
are
key
for
students
to
become
successful
and
should
be
taken
into
serious
consideration
making
one
s
own
decisions
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
it
provides
an
opportunity
to
take
responsibility
for
the
outcomes
and
to
learn
from
mistakes
having
control
over
decisions
helps
build
confidence
and
autonomy
allowing
individuals
to
develop
their
own
problem solving
skills
and
gain
experience
with
making
important
decisions
it
also
allows
for
the
exploration
of
individual
interests
and
preferences
on
the
other
hand
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
be
beneficial
too
these
sources
of
guidance
provide
an
opportunity
to
learn
from
experts
and
ask
questions
in
order
to
gain
an
informed
opinion
additionally
experts
and
authorities
can
provide
a
level
of
assurance
and
accuracy
that
some
individuals
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
on
their
own
overall
it
is
important
for
individuals
to
consider
their
options
when
making
decisions
weighing
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
or
making
their
own
decisions
having
the
ability
to
make
decisions
on
one
s
own
can
be
beneficial
in
the
long
run
however
seeking
guidance
can
also
have
its
advantages
playing
basketball
and
football
in
high
school
can
have
many
great
benefits
from
social
development
to
physical
health
focuses
on
quick
speed
and
agility
to
outplay
opponents
while
football
relies
on
strength
and
strategy
to
work
as
a
team
and
overpower
the
opposition
after
researching
the
pros
and
cons
of
both
sports
it
s
clear
that
football
is
the
right
choice
for
me
being
able
to
work
as
part
of
a
team
with
a
common
goal
is
a
hugely
valuable
life
skill
and
the
physical
demands
of
football
can
help
me
stay
in
shape
while
having
fun
furthermore
the
camaraderie
and
comradery
of
the
locker
room
are
unparalleled
and
one
of
the
most
rewarding
experiences
i
could
have
in
high
school
people
often
talk
about
being
true
to
oneself
but
it
can
be
difficult
to
understand
what
this
actually
means
for
me
it
means
to
act
in
accordance
with
my
values
and
beliefs
rather
than
conforming
to
the
expectations
of
others
this
is
incredibly
important
as
it
helps
us
to
reach
our
goals
and
live
our
best
lives
i
experienced
this
firsthand
when
i
decided
to
pursue
a
career
as
a
writer
everyone
in
my
life
from
friends
to
family
told
me
it
was
a
bad
idea
and
i
shouldn
t
do
it
instead
of
listening
to
their
advice
i
stayed
true
to
what
i
believed
in
my
heart
and
went
ahead
with
my
plans
after
a
rocky
start
i
can
now
say
that
i
have
established
myself
as
a
successful
freelance
writer
and
i
feel
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment
and
fulfillment
when
it
comes
to
finding
success
and
happiness
i
also
have
a
friend
who
will
be
the
first
to
remind
me
of
the
importance
of
being
true
to
oneself
she
always
emphasizes
that
going
after
what
we
desire
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
our
goals
for
example
she
had
a
long held
dream
of
becoming
a
veterinarian
despite
not
meeting
the
traditional
educational
requirements
yet
she
refused
to
give
up
her
dream
and
invested
her
time
and
effort
into
learning
what
was
necessary
to
make
it
a
reality
she
has
since
accomplished
her
dream
and
become
a
successful
vet
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
essential
that
we
stay
true
to
ourselves
and
our
own
values
and
beliefs
no
matter
what
others
might
think
or
say
this
can
be
seen
as
the
foundation
for
reaching
our
goals
and
creating
the
best
lives
for
ourselves
pianos
and
saxophones
are
two
of
the
most
widely used
instruments
in
the
world
of
music
with
a
piano
you
can
play
a
broad
range
of
music
including
classical
jazz
pop
rock
blues
and
more
as
for
saxophones
their
sound
can
be
heard
in
all
sorts
of
genres
including
jazz
blues
rock
funk
reggae
and
more
come
in
several
varieties
most
notably
acoustic
distorted
and
clean
an
acoustic
guitar
has
a
signature
warm
and
mellow
sound
and
is
best suited
for
acoustic
and
folk
music
distorted
guitars
are
often
used
in
progressive
and
heavy
metal
music
for
a
heavier
sound
with
electric
guitar
solos
often
using
this
type
of
guitar
lastly
clean
guitars
are
favored
by
jazz
folk
and
country
musicians
for
their
full
natural
sound
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
learn
an
instrument
will
depend
on
the
individual
s
level
of
commitment
and
dedication
someone
who
practices
regularly
can
learn
to
play
each
instrument
quite
quickly
while
others
might
take
longer
it
s
also
important
to
note
that
not
everyone
learns
at
the
same
rate
in
conclusion
each
of
these
three
instruments
has
its
own
set
of
sounds
and
styles
that
make
it
distinct
with
the
right
practice
and
dedication
any
musician
can
master
all
of
these
instruments
and
use
them
to
create
their
own
unique
music
the
great
philosopher
once
said
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
this
statement
is
profound
and
true
as
it
acknowledges
the
importance
of
pushing
ourselves
further
towards
our
greatest
potential
in
order
to
grow
we
must
be
willing
to
go
beyond
our
comfort
zone
and
traverse
unfamiliar
territory
in
order
to
broaden
our
horizons
and
personal
development
for
example
if
i
wished
to
become
a
professional
software
engineer
i
would
need
to
take
on
a
variety
of
different
tasks
far
beyond
what
i
already
know
without
continuing
to
learn
and
develop
my
knowledge
and
skills
beyond
what
i
am
already
comfortable
with
i
would
not
be
able
to
progress
in
my
career
in
any
meaningful
way
taking
on
challenges
in
a
specific
area
forces
us
to
think
critically
refining
our
existing
skillset
and
learning
new
ones
that
will
support
our
growth
s
statement
also
applies
to
our
personal
lives
whether
it
s
in
our
hobbies
our
relationships
or
even
our
daily
habits
if
we
keep
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
we
won
t
experience
growth
or
improve
our
individual
circumstances
we
need
to
challenge
ourselves
to
step
up
and
take
on
something
new
and
exciting
that
will
encourage
us
to
think
outside
the
box
trying
something
beyond
our
current
capabilities
will
develop
our
confidence
and
skill
allowing
us
to
develop
and
reach
our
potential
in
summary
s
statement
of
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
is
profound
and
true
to
grow
we
must
be
willing
to
step
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
and
take
on
unfamiliar
challenges
whether
it
s
professionally
or
personally
by
pushing
our
boundaries
we
will
be
setting
ourselves
up
for
personal
and
professional
betterment
failure
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
it
can
be
seen
as
both
good
and
bad
but
mainly
depends
on
one
s
attitude
towards
it
failure
can
open
up
new
opportunities
to
find
success
build
resilience
and
gain
valuable
life
lessons
it
pushes
us
to
stay
positive
motivated
and
determined
and
to
keep
striving
for
the
best
to
quote
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
failure
can
help
us
become
better
people
it
pushes
us
to
reflect
on
our
mistakes
and
strive
to
make
better
decisions
in
the
future
it
encourages
us
to
think
about
the
cause
of
failure
and
how
to
overcome
it
and
become
more
successful
on
the
other
hand
when
we
taste
success
we
should
value
it
and
continue
our
good
work
rather
than
using
it
as
the
only
measure
of
our
worth
in
order
to
make
failure
a
positive
experience
it
s
important
to
stay
motivated
accepting
our
failures
rather
than
dwelling
on
them
is
key
to
success
we
should
learn
from
mistakes
and
view
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
understanding
that
failure
is
part
of
the
process
can
help
us
stay
motivated
and
keep
us
from
getting
discouraged
finally
it
is
important
to
practice
self care
when
facing
failure
it
is
normal
to
feel
discouraged
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
setbacks
are
just
temporary
staying
positive
and
understanding
that
the
process
of
success
is
full
of
highs
and
lows
is
key
to
overcoming
failure
and
finding
success
to
summarize
failure
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
it
s
just
a
roadblock
that
we
must
overcome
in
order
to
find
success
staying
motivated
being
positive
and
learning
from
our
mistakes
are
all
important
aspects
of
recovering
from
failure
by
viewing
failure
in
this
way
we
can
transform
it
from
something
that
is
bad
into
something
that
can
ultimately
lead
to
success
technology
and
communication
are
playing
an
increasingly
important
role
in
the
development
of
games
and
activities
for
people
to
enjoy
as
companies
develop
new
games
they
must
provide
employees
with
the
right
tools
to
build
them
and
the
ability
to
communicate
efficiently
is
paramount
by
researching
the
available
technologies
and
their
use
in
creating
the
best
games
organizations
are
able
to
create
better
experiences
for
players
communication
is
key
in
enabling
employees
to
come
up
with
creative
ideas
and
develop
new
projects
companies
can
use
virtual
meetings
online
collaboration
tools
and
other
forms
of
communication
to
bring
people
together
to
work
out
new
game
ideas
and
build
better
products
doing
so
can
help
employees
to
brainstorm
better
game
concepts
and
enhance
the
overall
quality
of
the
product
having
a
positive
attitude
in
a
difficult
situation
can
be
an
invaluable
asset
no
one
can
control
the
events
that
happen
to
us
but
we
can
control
how
we
respond
to
them
having
a
positive
attitude
and
remaining
resilient
in
the
face
of
adversity
can
help
people
make
friends
foster
relationships
and
gain
respect
from
their
peers
for
example
a
college
freshman
who
is
struggling
to
make
friends
may
resist
the
temptation
to
give
up
instead
they
can
choose
to
look
on
the
bright
side
and
remain
hopeful
this
student
may
attend
regular
social
activities
or
volunteer
in
their
community
using
their
positive
attitude
to
draw
people
in
while
being
surrounded
by
positive
people
is
important
having
the
right
attitude
all
by
itself
can
create
a
welcoming
and
inviting
atmosphere
one
which
other
people
are
naturally
drawn
to
in
the
long
run
having
a
positive
attitude
is
the
most
powerful
tool
for
success
it
encourages
others
to
be
kind
and
supportive
while
also
creating
opportunities
for
personal
growth
it
is
often
said
that
attitude
is
everything
and
this
could
not
be
truer
when
it
comes
to
navigating
difficult
situations
having
a
positive
outlook
can
be
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
impressions
hold
a
lot
of
weight
in
our
lives
and
can
make
or
break
the
success
of
a
relationship
or
interaction
showing
your
best
self
right
off
the
bat
is
incredibly
important
to
ensure
that
the
other
person
gains
a
positive
first
impression
of
you
first
impressions
matter
because
they
are
used
to
form
initial
judgments
and
opinions
about
someone
which
can
shape
future
interactions
they
can
set
the
tone
of
a
relationship
from
romantic
to
professional
and
signal
your
style
of
communication
and
how
you
prefer
to
interact
with
other
people
they
can
be
extremely
hard
to
erase
so
it
s
important
to
stay
aware
and
make
sure
that
the
first
impression
you
leave
is
a
good
one
there
are
three
good
reasons
why
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
people
tend
to
remember
first
impressions
making
it
nearly
impossible
to
erase
people
are
more
prone
to
clinging
to
their
initial
judgments
thereby
making
it
difficult
to
alter
the
impression
even
after
further
exposure
and
impressions
often
shape
the
way
people
view
the
other
person
from
then
on
making
it
highly
difficult
for
that
person
to
rebuild
the
damaged
reputation
overall
it
is
essential
to
be
conscious
of
the
first
impression
that
you
leave
on
people
and
strive
to
show
your
best
self
at
the
start
this
will
go
a
long
way
in
helping
you
create
and
maintain
positive
relationships
in
your
life
famously
stated
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
the
idea
of
individualism
has
been
embedded
in
our
society
since
the
dawn
of
time
in
today
s
fast paced
world
it
is
often
easy
to
get
lost
in
the
collection
of
society
s
norms
and
expectations
however
having
the
freedom
to
think
and
act
without
the
fear
of
judgment
can
be
beneficial
both
in
and
out
of
the
workplace
individuals
have
the
power
to
create
their
own
unique
style
of
work
that
will
lead
to
success
this
allows
them
to
take
control
of
their
lives
and
figure
out
how
to
reach
their
goals
in
the
best
way
possible
meanwhile
selflessness
involves
serving
and
helping
others
it
has
different
implications
from
expressing
one
s
individuality
the
former
requires
the
individual
to
put
others
first
while
the
latter
is
all
about
taking
the
initiative
to
live
life
according
to
one
s
own
beliefs
and
values
in
the
future
we
could
expect
to
see
individualism
being
used
as
a
form
of
resistance
and
as
a
tool
for
self expression
as
the
world
continues
to
become
more
diverse
and
inclusive
individuals
who
practice
individualism
will
be
better
equipped
and
empowered
to
challenge
the
status
quo
this
could
open
up
new
realms
of
opportunities
for
people
that
were
previously
out
of
reach
individuality
may
be
the
key
to
unlocking
a
bright
and
successful
future
one
example
of
a
successful
immigrant
who
overcame
obstacles
to
achieve
his
goals
is
an
iranian
mathematician
and

she
continued
to

she
was
eventually
awarded
a

fellowship
to

she
became
the
first
woman
to
be
awarded

award
in

immigrants
who
come
to
the
states
face
a
large
number
of
challenges
including
cultural
linguistic
and
economic
barriers
serves
as
an
example
of
how
hard
work
and
perseverance
can
help
one
overcome
these
obstacles
and
achieve
success
she
demonstrated
that
with
dedication
and
determination
it
is
possible
to
achieve
one
s
goals
her
story
is
a
testament
to
the
value
of
hard
work
and
her
success
is
an
inspiration
to
young
immigrants
who
strive
to
make
their
own
mark
in
the
states
the
development
of
distance
learning
classes
has
dramatically
altered
the
way
students
approach
their
schooling
learning
classes
have
provided
students
with
more
opportunities
to
become
self directed
and
self motivated
while
creating
new
obstacles
to
overcome
when
it
comes
to
taking
responsibility
for
their
own
education
some
students
may
take
advantage
of
the
lack
of
structure
present
in
these
classes
by
skipping
classes
and
engaging
in
activities
that
are
non academic
in
nature
this
type
of
self imposed
irresponsibility
can
have
an
immensely
negative
impact
on
their
motivation
and
expectations
for
their
learning
on
one
hand
the
lack
of
structure
and
supervision
can
allow
students
the
freedom
to
take
more
responsibility
for
their
own
learning
but
on
the
other
hand
it
can
lead
to
neglect
of
their
educational
obligations
ultimately
distance
learning
classes
have
opened
up
new
possibilities
for
students
in
terms
of
learning
opportunities
as
well
as
potential
pitfalls
in
terms
of
difficulty
in
maintaining
motivation
and
expectations
for
their
own
education
requiring
community
service
or
extra
punishment
for
students
who
violate
school
regulations
is
an
important
decision
that
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
students
and
the
school
community
on
the
one
hand
requiring
community
service
can
give
students
an
opportunity
to
learn
valuable
skills
while
also
more
generally
instilling
in
them
a
sense
of
responsibility
to
their
community
on
the
other
hand
extra
punishment
such
as
suspension
can
have
a
strong
deterrent
effect
sending
a
message
to
the
rest
of
the
student
body
that
actions
have
consequences
having
experienced
the
effectiveness
of
both
approaches
while
in
school
i
believe
that
for
serious
violations
suspension
is
the
more
appropriate
approach
it
sends
a
more
serious
message
that
violations
will
not
be
tolerated
able
to
shift
the
culture
of
a
school
in
a
short
amount
of
time
the
experience
of
suspension
itself
can
also
help
remind
students
to
take
their
academics
and
behaviors
more
seriously
and
the
lack
of
attendance
may
help
students
target
their
studies
with
greater
focus
ultimately
i
think
that
a
combination
of
both
approaches
is
best
community
service
and
supplements
of
harsher
punishments
when
warranted
provide
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
that
can
be
used
to
effectively
deter
students
from
breaking
school
regulations
recently
my
school
made
a
policy
change
requiring
students
to
maintain
a
average
or
higher
in
order
to
participate
in
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
i
strongly
believe
this
policy
change
is
unreasonable
and
unfair
of
all
participating
in
activities
such
as
sports
and
clubs
has
been
found
to
have
a
tremendously
positive
effect
on
student
productivity
involvement
and
overall
well being
students
who
are
involved
in
activities
such
as
these
have
been
proven
to
have
higher
levels
of
engagement
and
have
fewer
disciplinary
issues
within
the
school
without
a
chance
to
pursue
these
activities
students
could
suffer
a
range
of
negative
effects
such
as
lower
motivation
and
weaker
relationships
with
peers
this
policy
unfairly
punishes
students
who
may
struggle
academically
many
students
struggle
in
one
or
more
subjects
and
have
to
work
much
harder
to
pass
their
classes
even
though
they
may
put
in
that
extra
effort
a
average
may
still
be
out
of
reach
for
them
it
does
n t
seem
fair
that
these
students
should
be
left
out
of
these
important
activities
that
can
help
them
succeed
in
some
form
or
another
lastly
this
policy
reinforces
the
idea
that
only
students
who
excel
in
academics
are
worthy
of
success
by
setting
such
high
academic
standards
students
are
made
to
feel
inferior
if
they
do
not
reach
this
academic
benchmark
in
reality
success
takes
on
many
forms
and
we
should
recognize
and
encourage
students
to
pursue
avenues
that
may
not
always
include
academic
excellence
the
policy
change
on
sports
and
activities
requiring
average
grades
is
rigid
and
overlooks
the
importance
of
extracurricular
activities
for
our
students
by
no
means
should
we
lower
our
academic
standards
but
rather
recognize
the
various
forms
of
success
among
our
student
body
many
people
believe
it
is
not
advantageous
to
go
beyond
what
they
have
already
mastered
with
the
idea
that
it
opens
up
the
potential
risk
for
failure
they
may
cite
examples
such
as
taking
on
a
career
path
they
do
not
have
the
necessary
experience
to
excel
in
or
attempting
a
project
they
are
under prepared
for
however
taking
on
more
than
what
you
have
already
mastered
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
it
can
stretch
your
boundaries
and
allow
you
to
explore
new
and
innovative
ways
to
tackle
whatever
task
is
in
front
of
you
it
can
also
provide
invaluable
experience
and
learning
opportunities
such
as
in
the
example
of
attempting
a
project
outside
of
your
comfort
zone
going
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
can
also
be
a
fantastic
role
model
to
the
public
it
can
encourage
others
to
do
the
same
while
also
demonstrating
your
willingness
to
take
risks
and
be
proactive
in
achieving
success
the
impact
of
going
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
on
your
after
life
can
be
positive
or
negative
depending
on
the
outcome
it
can
be
extremely
rewarding
to
reach
the
objectives
you
set
but
it
can
also
be
demoralizing
when
you
come
up
short
nevertheless
the
most
pertinent
takeaway
is
that
it
should
be
a
calculated
risk
based
on
analysis
and
research
in
conclusion
it
is
important
to
consider
the
risks
associated
with
going
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
yet
realize
the
potential
rewards
that
can
come
with
success
taking
a
chance
to
reach
a
goal
can
have
a
profound
long term
impact
if
approached
with
the
right
attitude
writing
a
professional
statement
or
story
is
a
crucial
skill
in
today
s
world
not
only
in
the
professional
arena
but
in
everyday
life
too
we
often
find
ourselves
in
situations
where
writing
in
a
professional
manner
is
important
to
get
ahead
such
as
submitting
a
job
application
completing
an
academic
assignment
or
entering
a
competition
take
for
example
a
university
student
looking
to
boost
her
chances
of
landing
a
summer
internship
an
essential
element
of
her
application
is
her
professional
statement
she
knows
it
must
be
concise
and
free
of
errors
achieving
the
latter
comes
with
painstaking
checks
and
edits
she
uses
quotations
marks
to
highlight
her
points
too
after
multiple
revisions
she
is
confident
in
her
professional
statement
and
is
sure
it
stands
out
amongst
her
peers
the
conflict
in
this
story
surrounds
s
fixation
on
creating
an
impeccable
statement
she
must
review
it
more
times
than
she
ever
imagined
ultimately
taking
up
more
time
than
she
had
anticipated
however
the
hard
work
she
put
into
her
statement
pays
off
she
gets
accepted
into
the
internship
at
her
dream
company
and
is
ready
to
start
her
new
adventure
this
story
illustrates
the
importance
of
writing
a
professional
statement
or
story
if
we
want
to
stand
out
we
must
invest
our
time
and
effort
into
it
just
as
did
we
can
double check
our
statements
to
ensure
accuracy
of
facts
use
quotations
marks
to
make
our
points
pop
and
create
a
professional
title
and
cover
if
we
re
diligent
and
invest
the
necessary
effort
professional
success
is
right
around
the
corner
seeking
multiple
opinions
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
making
decisions
and
receiving
advice
it
can
help
an
individual
see
the
situation
or
problem
from
several
different
angles
and
provide
them
with
a
well rounded
perspective
additionally
having
access
to
different
points
of
view
can
help
people
to
stay
motivated
in
their
pursuit
of
the
best
possible
solution
real life
examples
of
this
concept
abound
take
for
example
the
case
of
and
when
launching
the
company
sought
the
collective
input
of
over
a
hundred
of
colleagues
and
advisors
before
finally
deciding
where
to
take
the
company
since
then
he
has
continued
to
gather
multiple
opinions
as
he
navigates
the
challenges
of
running
a
successful
automotive
brand
this
approach
has
helped
him
make
wise
decisions
and
drive
growing
success
for
his
organization
seeking
multiple
opinions
can
be
an
invaluable
resource
for
decision making
and
advice seeking
allowing
individuals
to
remain
motivated
and
choose
the
right
option
many
of
us
strive
to
build
our
self esteem
each
day
some
use
achievement
while
others
gravitate
towards
being
praised
achievement
awards
us
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
in
turn
may
boost
our
self esteem
in
modern
society
there
is
a
lot
of
pressure
to
achieve
we
are
consistently
striving
for
success
even
if
it
is
not
our
own
this
can
lead
to
us
becoming
focused
on
external
goals
on
the
other
hand
praise
is
often
seen
as
a
way
to
build
self esteem
without
the
pressure
that
comes
with
achievement
complimented
allows
us
to
feel
more
positively
about
ourselves
however
it
may
not
always
be
rooted
in
reality
as
it
often
relies
on
somebody
else
s
opinion
it
also
can
become
overused
and
stop
having
the
same
effect
in
general
true
self esteem
is
better
built
through
achievement
because
it
relies
on
our
own
successful
pursuits
rather
than
external
validation
it
helps
us
to
develop
confidence
in
our
own
abilities
and
learn
where
we
need
to
work
harder
though
there
is
pressure
involved
focusing
on
our
own
goals
as
our
source
of
validation
can
prove
to
be
extremely
rewarding
enforcing
a
curfew
for
teens
in
cities
can
have
positive
and
negative
effects
on
public
safety
wellbeing
and
productivity
one
potential
positive
outcome
is
that
a
curfew
could
in
theory
reduce
crime
and
delinquency
among
teens
which
would
in
turn
increase
public
safety
on
the
other
hand
some
experts
suggest
that
curfews
could
lead
to
dangers
such
as
over policing
or
police
harassment
of
teens
which
would
be
a
violation
of
their
rights
as
well
as
an
additional
safety
risk
some
research
indicates
that
the
effects
of
curfews
on
delinquency
and
crime
are
overstated
well being
too
has
been
found
to
be
affected
by
curfew
implementation
on
one
hand
curfews
can
be
beneficial
for
well being
insofar
as
they
protect
teens
from
potential
harm
or
danger
and
provide
a
structure
to
regulate
their
behavior
on
the
other
hand
the
restrictions
of
a
curfew
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
conflicts
between
teens
and
their
parents
as
well
as
bands
on
social
interaction
both
of
which
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
their
overall
wellbeing
when
it
comes
to
productivity
curfews
could
lead
to
a
decrease
in
nighttime
economic
activities
such
as
night
shifts
by
teens
and
potentially
hinder
personal
and
educational
development
this
could
be
counteracted
however
by
developing
a
personal
curfew
that
allows
teens
to
engage
in
productive
activities
and
still
stay
safe
establishing
a
personal
curfew
and
monitoring
its
use
could
help
teens
to
become
more
responsible
for
their
wellbeing
and
better
prepared
for
adulthood
high
school
can
be
a
stressful
time
for
anyone
but
especially
for
teens
trying
to
figure
out
what
they
want
to
do
with
the
rest
of
their
lives
many
people
believe
that
it
is
a
good
idea
for
students
to
identify
a
career
by
the
time
they
enter
high
school
but
this
expectation
is
unrealistic
and
can
sometimes
backfire
identifying
a
career
by
the
time
students
enter
high
school
puts
an
immense
amount
of
pressure
on
them
many
teens
are
required
to
decide
what
career
path
they
want
to
take
at
a
time
when
they
can
barely
decide
what
to
have
for
lunch
or
what
to
wear
without
the
proper
guidance
and
resources
too
many
teens
are
set
up
for
disappointment
and
failure
if
they
choose
the
wrong
career
path
in
addition
to
the
stress
and
pressure
of
having
to
decide
on
a
career
at
a
young
age
there
is
the
potential
for
students
to
limit
themselves
when
making
career
decisions
many
teens
opt
for
the
safer
more
traditional
career
options
such
as
engineering
or
law
while
missing
out
on
exciting
and
potentially
more
rewarding
career
paths
such
as
art
music
or
other
creative
fields
when
teens
limit
themselves
to
one
career
chosen
too
early
they
miss
out
on
the
exploration
and
excitement
of
figuring
out
what
their
true
passions
are
and
can
find
themselves
feeling
stuck
in
a
job
they
re
not
passionate
about
overall
it
is
not
a
good
idea
for
students
to
identify
a
career
before
entering
high
school
the
amount
of
pressure
teens
are
put
under
to
choose
a
career
path
is
tremendous
and
can
lead
to
disappointment
and
stress
later
on
in
addition
when
teens
limit
themselves
to
a
single
career
path
at
such
a
young
age
they
are
unable
to
explore
their
passions
and
may
feel
like
they
are
stuck
in
a
job
they
don
t
want
therefore
it
is
important
that
teens
explore
their
interests
and
don
t
feel
forced
to
commit
to
a
career
too
early
the
sciences
are
vast
and
wide
with
a
variety
of
topics
such
as
biology
chemistry
physics
and
astronomy
to
investigate
these
topics
one
would
use
various
methods
and
tools
meaning
a
tiny
spark
or
trace
can
be
used
as
a
metaphor
for
the
bits
of
knowledge
acquired
from
investigating
these
areas
of
study
notation
is
also
used
to
give
an
exact
format
for
writing
and
expressing
large
numbers
for
example
writing
to
the
power
of
is
expressed
as
x
this
is
used
when
discussing
topics
such
as
astronomy
where
distances
in
light years
away
are
often
measured
in
this
format
also
heavily
impacts
our
day to day
life
from
the
air
we
breathe
to
the
food
we
eat
it
all
comes
from
science
not
only
that
but
the
clothing
and
materials
we
use
the
medicines
and
vaccines
that
keep
us
safe
and
the
technologies
we
use
to
stay
connected
are
all
a
result
of
science
becoming
an
expert
in
the
sciences
requires
dedication
and
study
over
many
years
depending
on
the
specialization
the
time frame
varies
generally
one
may
spend
around
five
years
on
their
undergraduate
studies
six
more
for
a
and
another
three
to
five
for
a
there
are
also
chain
changes
and
bevels
that
contribute
to
the
sciences
they
both
act
as
catalysts
and
create
reactions
within
a
specific
project
or
area
of
study
which
act
as
the
building
blocks
to
form
the
complete
result
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
achieving
success
in
life
is
having
a
positive
attitude
research
shows
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
tangible
benefits
such
as
making
a
good
impression
on
those
around
you
and
inspiring
those
around
you
to
also
be
positive
additionally
having
a
positive
attitude
can
often
lead
to
gaining
favor
from
others
making
it
easier
to
achieve
goals
however
there
can
be
negative
outcomes
from
having
a
positive
attitude
as
well
for
example
it
is
possible
that
one
can
be
taken
advantage
of
if
they
are
always
eager
to
help
due
to
their
positive
attitude
jealousy
can
stem
from
one
s
positivity
if
others
have
a
negative
attitude
and
can
not
accept
success
achieved
by
someone
else
while
hard
work
is
also
essential
to
achieving
success
it
is
important
to
note
that
having
the
right
mindset
also
plays
a
major
role
it
has
been
found
that
those
with
a
strong
work
ethic
combined
with
a
positive
attitude
have
a
much
better
chance
of
succeeding
in
life
ultimately
a
positive
attitude
can
make
a
huge
difference
in
how
successful
one
is
not
only
in
their
career
but
in
life
overall
the
pairing
of
younger
students
with
older
students
as
a
program
to
provide
additional
academic
support
is
gaining
traction
in
many
schools
by
pairing
younger
students
with
more
experienced
peers
they
can
receive
feedback
on
their
work
learning
strategies
and
frequent
support
for
areas
of
confusion
this
program
could
help
to
build
confidence
and
provide
a
friendly
environment
to
develop
and
practice
skills
without
the
pressure
of
a
more
formal
learning
setting
however
there
are
some
potential
challenges
to
consider
when
implementing
such
an
academic
support
program
older
students
may
not
always
have
the
capacity
or
desire
to
act
as
mentors
and
in
some
cases
the
pairing
might
not
provide
the
correct
support
for
younger
students
another
issue
is
the
need
to
recruit
and
train
suitable
mentors
as
well
as
ensuring
the
younger
students
are
aware
of
the
program
and
taking
part
in
it
careful
implementation
of
such
a
program
is
key
looking
to
use
the
program
should
identify
the
suitable
mentors
and
equip
them
with
the
skills
and
training
needed
to
act
as
mentors
as
well
as
design
curriculums
or
programs
to
ensure
that
the
correct
level
of
support
is
provided
by
doing
so
similar
programs
could
be
implemented
in
other
schools
and
provide
valuable
additional
academic
support
to
younger
students
taking
classes
online
offers
a
unique
and
possibly
more
advantageous
learning
experience
to
students
from
the
convenience
of
their
own
home
students
are
able
to
work
on
their
studies
at
their
own
pace
and
often
with
more
flexibility
in
their
schedules
this
is
especially
beneficial
when
it
comes
to
those
with
other
commitments
or
responsibilities
however
taking
classes
online
also
comes
with
some
cautionary

learning
does
not
always
offer
the
opportunity
to
meet
and
collaborate
with
other
students
and
students
must
be
completely
self motivated
and
organized
in
order
to
be
successful
online
it
is
important
to
speak
with
a
school
counselor
or
educational
advisor
to
fully
understand
the
pros
and
cons
of
taking
classes
online
as
well
as
taking
a
test
to
assess
one
s
readiness
for
remote
learning
that
said
if
you
choose
to
pursue
online
classes
there
are
a
plethora
of
potential
rewards

classes
from
home
could
allow
more
opportunities
for
free
time
consistent
concentration
and
the
ability
to
work
on
coursework
at
one
s
own
pace
additionally
many
students
can
even
make
gains
in
terms
of
grades
by
taking
their
classes
online
it
is
up
to
each
student
to
do
their
research
assess
their
skills
and
make
a
conscious
decision
about
whether
taking
classes
online
is
the
best
choice
for
them
failure
and
mistakes
have
the
potential
to
be
some
of
the
most
beneficial
experiences
a
person
can
encounter
in
the
pursuit
of
success
it
is
in
failure
that
we
are
able
to
identify
our
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
learn
how
to
adapt
and
refine
our
approach
to
getting
the
results
that
we
want
each
error
acts
as
guidance
to
make
changes
to
our
efforts
taking
us
closer
and
closer
to
our
goals
additionally
mistakes
and
failures
help
provide
a
sense
of
realism
in
the
pursuit
of
success
offering
a
valuable
learning by doing
experience
when
we
fail
we
understand
that
it
is
perfectly
normal
and
natural
to
struggle
in
our
efforts
this
reality
check
helps
build
resilience
and
teaches
us
to
become
more
persistent
and
diligent
in
order
to
achieve
success
finally
making
mistakes
and
dealing
with
failure
have
the
potential
to
be
incredibly
liberating
experiences
when
we
accept
that
failure
is
part
of
the
journey
it
allows
us
to
focus
on
what
truly
matters
taking
the
necessary
steps
to
actually
achieve
our
goals
when
we
stop
fearing
failure
we
can
start
taking
action
ultimately
failure
and
mistakes
on
the
road
to
success
should
not
be
considered
an
end
in
themselves
but
rather
an
opportunity
to
learn
grow
and
stay
motivated
by
actively
learning
from
our
errors
and
using
them
to
fuel
our
progress
we
can
develop
the
determination
and
skills
needed
to
make
our
aspirations
a
reality
has
always
been
one
of
the
strongest
motivators
for
those
seeking
to
excel
in
their
academic
professional
and
personal
endeavors
surprisingly
failure
can
often
be
an
essential
step
to
achieving
success
allowing
us
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
build
a
better
strategy
for
the
future
effort
and
enthusiasm
are
essential
components
of
success
and
while
we
may
not
always
understand
the
result
of
our
efforts
that
dedication
and
enthusiasm
can
be
invaluable
in
helping
us
achieve
our
goals
is
filled
with
stories
of
individuals
who
have
achieved
remarkable
success
despite
encountering
obstacles
and
failure
along
the
way
these
stories
of
triumph
show
us
that
success
can
be
obtained
from
any
difficulties
we
may
encounter
as
long
as
we
remain
focused
and
steadfast
plays
an
important
role
in
achieving
our
goals
it
is
the
ability
to
stick
to
a
plan
and
continue
to
move
toward
a
desired
outcome
despite
any
obstacles
and
impediments
that
may
arise
it
is
easy
to
give
up
when
faced
with
a
difficult
task
but
peristence
allows
us
to
see
the
journey
through
to
the
end
however
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
success
is
not
always
guaranteed
family
support
is
another
key
component
of
achieving
our
goals
having
the
support
of
family
can
provide
comfort
and
encouragement
to
keep
going
even
when
times
get
tough
but
it
is
important
to
consider
that
family
support
can
be
both
beneficial
and
detrimental
to
success
when
mistakes
are
made
it
is
important
to
understand
the
difference
between
successes
and
failures
while
it
may
be
tempting
to
give
up
after
a
setback
it
is
important
to
learn
from
the
mistakes
and
use
them
to
make
adjustments
for
the
future
it
is
only
through
successes
and
failures
that
we
can
develop
and
grow
as
individuals
i
was
on
the
phone
with
my
brother
trying
to
figure
out
what
i
should
do
after
high
school
i
was
really
interested
in
college
but
i
was
n t
sure
where
to
start
i
asked
him
what
he
did
after
high
school
and
he
explained
the
importance
of
having
a
general
understanding
of
my
financial
and
academic
resources
he
also
said
that
i
should
check
in
with
my
counselor
about
what
colleges
would
be
best
for
me
based
on
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
i
then
called
my
parents
to
ask
them
about
the
finances
they
talked
to
me
about
how
much
money
was
available
for
college
tuition
and
gave
me
some
valuable
tips
on
how
i
can
save
money
they
also
explained
the
importance
of
both
academics
and
socializing
during
college
finally
i
asked
my
friends
what
their
college
plans
were
most
of
them
are
planning
on
attending
college
in
some
shape
or
form
and
it
was
really
helpful
to
hear
their
stories
about
the
different
steps
they
took
to
get
accepted
in
recent
discussions
many
experts
have
come
out
with
opinions
for
and
against
the
implementation
of
one
and
a
half
hours
of
extra
school
each
day
from
the
perspective
of
students
having
more
time
for
instruction
and
learning
is
largely
seen
as
a
moderate
benefit
even
if
it
is
difficult
to
stick
to
a
rigid
schedule
each
day
however
as
this
extra
time
cuts
into
the
students
after school
activities
and
leisure
time
there
are
many
students
who
would
rather
not
have
to
experience
the
extra
burden
of
an
extended
school
day
conversely
parents
often
have
debates
over
whether
implementing
this
plan
can
be
beneficial
for
their
children
while
many
note
the
advantages
that
come
from
extra
instruction
time
many
parents
also
worry
about
the
safety
of
their
children
having
to
remain
on
school
premises
for
such
a
prolonged
period
especially
if
this
extra
time
is
added
outside
of
normal
school
hours
finally
educators
often
remain
divided
on
this
issue
as
well
many
teachers
are
well versed
on
the
importance
of
having
students
spend
more
time
in
the
classroom
but
others
worry
that
pushing
students
too
hard
would
put
too
much
stress
on
them
and
have
a
negative
effect
on
their
attitude
towards
learning
in
conclusion
while
there
are
some
advantages
to
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
there
are
also
several
drawbacks
to
consider
from
multiple
perspectives
it
is
up
to
school
administrators
and
policymakers
to
weigh
the
pro
s
and
con
s
and
make
the
best
decision
for
their
students
everyone
has
experienced
firsthand
the
importance
of
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
in
school
from
personal
experience
i
know
that
engaging
in
one
of
these
activities
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
your
life
part
of
a
team
or
organization
helped
me
make
friends
and
build
bonds
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
meet
people
who
had
similar
interests
and
passions
on
top
of
that
i
found
myself
becoming
more
productive
and
staying
organized
with
the
commitment
of
the
responsibilities
it
brought
it
was
by
being
part
of
these
activities
that
i
discovered
new
passions
and
hobbies
without
taking
part
in
these
after school
activities
i
would
have
never
been
able
to
find
my
own
callings
extracurricular
activities
are
essential
in
self discovery
it
gives
one
a
chance
to
develop
skills
and
self confidence
it
helps
us
appreciate
the
importance
of
teamwork
and
encourages
us
to
have
a
sense
of
belonging
the
opportunities
for
growth
are
endless
therefore
it
is
important
for
everyone
to
participate
in
at
least
one
extracurricular
activity
doing
this
could
change
one
s
life
in
a
positive
way
and
could
ultimately
open
the
door
for
opportunities
of
a
lifetime
teamwork
is
essential
for
success
both
in
everyday
life
and
in
major
projects
from
government
initiatives
to
the
workflows
of
restaurants
there
is
no
denying
the
importance
of
having
a
team
behind
the
success
story
working
together
each
individual
contributes
their
own
expertise
with
the
whole
being
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
trust
and
collaboration
are
essential
to
the
success
of
teamwork
projects
can
quickly
go
awry
when
team
members
don
t
understand
what
their
colleagues
are
doing
or
trust
them
to
do
the
job
properly
it
is
also
important
for
teams
to
work
towards
a
concrete
unified
goal
this
helps
to
increase
engagement
among
team
members
and
make
the
job
manageable
in
a
way
that
individual
work
could
not
also
prevents
overwork
by
delegating
tasks
to
individuals
members
are
able
to
focus
on
their
particular
strengths
while
at
the
same
time
relying
on
the
rest
of
the
team
to
adhere
to
their
roles
the
combination
of
trust
and
authority
is
what
allows
teams
to
succeed
the
implications
of
not
having
effective
teamwork
are
immense
projects
could
take
significantly
longer
morale
could
be
decreased
and
the
overall
success
of
the
endeavor
could
be
negatively
impacted
it
is
clear
that
without
teamwork
the
completion
of
major
goals
is
much
more
difficult
if
not
impossible
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
teamwork
is
essential
in
order
to
achieve
success
by
communicating
with
each
other
trusting
each
other
and
delegating
tasks
to
team
members
the
efforts
are
much
more
likely
to
succeed
without
the
use
of
teamwork
there
is
the
risk
of
overwork
lack
of
engagement
and
major
projects
taking
longer
than
necessary
it
is
for
this
reason
that
teamwork
is
seen
as
essential
and
should
always
be
taken
into
consideration
for
successful
project
completion

pick up
game

be
the
perfect
way
to
get
exercise
and
unwind
playing
catch
teaches
us
the
basics
of
good
communication
and
cooperation
it
requires
eye hand
coordination
which
is
important
both
on
the
field
and
in
our
everyday
lives
we
learn
to
listen
closely
to
directions
we
are
given
and
how
to
work
as
a
team
riding
a
bike
is
a
great
way
to
stay
in
shape

explore

is
also
an
inexpensive
form
of
transportation

can
help
us

our
environment

the
car

leisurely
bike

spending
time
outdoors
comes
with
numerous
benefits
from
strengthening
physical
and
mental
health
to
developing
skills
outdoor
activities
can
be
a
great
way
to
get
outside
and
enjoy
the
natural
environment
since
the
dawn
of
the
technological
age
technology
has
vastly
changed
the
way
we
live
and
communicate
it
has
helped
to
bridge
distances
and
bring
people
from
all
over
the
world
closer
together
hath
enabled
us
to
share
information
quickly
and
securely
and
has
made
it
easier
than
ever
to
shop
for
essential
items
in
fact
without
technology
most
of
the
of
the
conveniences
that
a
lot
of
us
now
take
for
granted such
as
dial
up
internet
access
online
banking
and
shopping
through
e commerce
websites would
not
be
available
however
technology
also
poses
some
negative
implications
to
daily
life
from
intrusive
surveillance
to
cyberbullying
to
the
expensiveness
of
much
of
the
technology
available
people
must
be
vigilant
in
order
to
maintain
a
balance
between
the
two
when
it
comes
to
communication
technology
has
done
amazing
things
to
help
keep
us
connected
chat
services
such
as
have
clearly
made
it
easier
to
keep
in
touch
with
friends
and
family
who
live
far
away
networks
such
as
have
made
it
easier
to
maintain
relationships
with
people
that
we
may
not
be
able
to
physically
meet
up
with
and
email
has
been
incredibly
useful
for
starting
and
maintaining
dialogue
with
someone
without
needing
to
set
aside
a
large
block
of
time
for
a
meeting
or
a
phone
call
shopping
has
also
been
made
infinitely
simpler
and
more
convenient
with
technology
thanks
to
the
advent
of
the
internet
we
can
now
order
virtually
anything
we
need
from
our
computers
and
phones
and
it
gets
delivered
right
to
our
doorstep
this
has
revolutionized
our
shopping
habits
and
allowed
people
to
live
much
more
easily
and
independently
but
as
with
any
powerful
tool
technology
can
also
be
used
for
less
than
altruistic
purposes
for
example
is
one
of
the
easiest
ways
for
people
to
take
advantage
of
the
anonymity
the
internet
provides
to
attack
and
harass
someone
without
fear
of
repercussion
this
type
of
bullying
is
especially
difficult
for
parents
and
educators
to
deal
with
since
the
harmful
messages
can
be
so
quickly
sent
and
spread
overall
technology
has
had
a
profound
impact
on
people
s
lives
both
good
and
bad
with
increasing
access
to
more
powerful
affordable
devices
this
impact
is
only
going
to
continue
to
grow
although
it
is
important
to
remember
that
there
are
still
potential
issues
technology
continues
to
unlock
more
and
more
opportunities
in
our
everyday
lives

simply
did
n t
exist
before

positive
attitude
can
open
up
doors
i
never
could
have
imagined
when

was
younger
i
had
difficulty
making
friends

when
i
shifted
from
having
an
apathetic
attitude
to
one
of
enthusiastic
participation
i
began
to
attract
new
friends
and
find
joy
in
the
moments
i
d
been
missing
out
on
i
am
constantly
reflecting
on
how
my
attitude
influences
my
experiences
and
the
relationships
i
form
this
introspective
attitude
has
helped
me
grow
and
gain
a
better
understanding
of
not
only
myself
but
of
those
around
me
by
becoming
aware
of
the
attitudes
of
my
siblings
and
family
i
am
better
able
to
appreciate
different
perspectives
and
better
collaborate
and
communicate
with
them

individuals
respond
to
situations

either
a
positive
or
negative
frame
of
mind

been
an
eye opening

examples
of
well
known

when
faced
with
potential
distractions
i
also
want
to
be
more
aware
of
people
who
don
t
have
my
best
interests
in
mind
as
well
as
discover
activities
i
can
do
with
friends
that
support
each
other
lastly
i
want
to
look
into
effective
methods
for
completing
school
and
remaining
organized
i
plan
to
complete
each
goal
within
a
six
month
timeline
with
this
i
will
be
able
to
stay
focused
on
my
path
and
have
a
successful
year
ahead
the
debate
over
year round
school
has
been
especially
contentious
in
recent
years
supporters
of
year round
school
argue
that
it
provides
students
with
more
flexible
scheduling
allowing
them
to
take
classes
during
regular
summer
months
instead
of
having
an
extended
december march
break
additionally
they
suggest
that
a
continuous
educational
cycle
supports
learning
and
decreases
the
amount
of
time
devoted
to
reviewing
earlier
material
upon
returning
to
school
critics
of
year round
school
contend
that
it
results
in
teachers
having
greater
workloads
since
they
are
required
to
teach
for
more
weeks
each
year
other
drawbacks
include
increased
energy
costs
for
schools
that
need
to
remain
in
operation
during
the
summer
months
and
decreased
recreational
opportunities
for
students
who
are
occupied
with
school
instead
of
enjoying
summer
activities
with
their
classmates
alternatives
to
year round
school
include
extending
the
traditional
school
day
for
traditional
school
years
could
also
look
into
reapportioning
the
longer
december march
break
or
shifting
towards
a
four day
school
week
lastly
summer
break
offers
students
the
opportunity
to
attain
further
academic
progress
and
even
available
internships
as
well
as
the
chance
to
relax
break
allows
students
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
activities
that
help
them
relax
and
view
learning
in
a
different
light which
in
turn
can
make
learning
more
enjoyable
working
in
a
group
can
offer
many
benefits
that
working
alone
does
not
for
starters
working
in
a
group
allows
individuals
to
gain
a
variety
of
perspectives
on
any
given
task
by
hearing
other
people
s
ideas
and
opinions
individuals
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
any
situation
and
figure
out
the
best
solutions
working
as
a
team
can
also
help
everyone
to
stay
focused
and
motivated
leading
to
more
efficient
and
productive
work
examples
of
successful
people
who
work
in
teams
include
successful
entrepreneurs
such
as
and
as
well
as
creative
professionals
like
directors
and
as
these
examples
indicate
a
team
can
come
up
with
innovative
solutions
and
ideas
and
be
more
creative
than
working
alone
in
contrast
working
alone
may
have
its
own
advantages
for
example
working
alone
ensures
full
control
over
any
project
without
having
to
compromise
with
other
team
members
however
the
problem
of
working
alone
is
that
it
can
be
time consuming
and
tedious
as
getting
stuck
on
any
problem
will
put
a
halt
to
progress
overall
it
is
clear
that
working
in
a
group
is
more
beneficial
than
working
alone
as
teams
can
come
up
with
more
innovative
and
creative
solutions
and
be
more
productive
working
together
also
allows
individuals
to
expand
their
knowledge
and
receive
feedback
on
their
work
which
can
be
an
invaluable
asset
once
said
that
which
we
persist
in
doing
becomes
easier
not
that
the
nature
of
the
task
has
changed
but
our
ability
to
do
has
increased
his
statement
rings
true
in
my
own
experience
of
learning
to
play
a
musical
instrument
and
a
sport
setting
goals
and
challenging
myself
to
reach
them
meant
spending
more
and
more
time
practicing
pushing
myself
beyond
the
limits
i
knew
i
was
capable
of
i
experienced
the
joy
of
growth
because
i
could
feel
my
abilities
increasing
as
i
continued
to
work
hard
but
growth
can
be
difficult
it
often
required
patience
dedication
and
perseverance
in
the
face
of
frustration
when
i
did
not
achieve
my
goals
or
faced
setbacks
it
s
not
easy
to
keep
up
motivation
and
enthusiasm
for
something
that
can
seem
insurmountable
but
the
payoff
of
success
feels
all
the
greater
when
with
the
help
of
dedication
and
perseverance
i
am
able
to
push
myself
and
find
new
heights
of
excellence
working
with
a
group
on
an
assignment
can
be
extremely
beneficial
particularly
when
it
comes
to
leveraging
the
strengths
of
each
group
member
the
advantages
of
working
in
a
team
include
getting
varied
perspectives
diverse
voices
and
multiple
inputs
that
broaden
the
scope
and
depth
of
the
assignment
working
with
others
also
increases
motivation
and
allows
the
group
to
find
a
collective
strategy
and
direction
the
group
leader
plays
an
important
role
in
any
group
setting
the
goals
and
guiding
the
team
in
order
to
maximize
their
collective
potential
by
combining
the
knowledge
skills
and
creativity
of
each
member
of
the
team
it
is
easier
to
create
a
better
quality
product
and
have
more
collaborative
success
than
if
working
alone
to
conclude
working
in
a
group
is
essential
to
producing
successful
outcomes
for
a
project
and
it
also
provides
team
members
with
essential
skills
for
future
projects
after
researching
the
potential
career
options
available
to
high
school
students
i
have
identified
data
science
as
the
best
fit
for
my
skillset
and
long term
goals
to
prepare
for
higher
education
i
plan
to
take
on
the
role
of
an
intern
at
local
data
science
companies
to
further
my
knowledge
and
experience
in
this
field
additionally
i
will
take
advanced
courses
during
high
school
to
better
prepare
me
for
college level
classes
i
will
also
reach
out
to
local
professionals
to
receive
advice
and
mentorship
to
aid
me
as
i
develop
my
skillset
by
utilizing
these
resources
and
focusing
my
efforts
on
data
science
i
plan
to
increase
my
knowledge
and
skills
to
prepare
myself
for
a
successful
academic
and
professional
career
as
a
student
i
strongly
believe
that
the
school
board
should
not
add
more
time
to
the
school
hours
while
i
understand
there
is
great
interest
to
improve
the
quality
of
education
i
do
n t
think
that
a
longer
school
day
would
do
much
good
for
starters
increasing
the
school
hours
would
likely
take
away
valuable
time
that
students
need
to
complete
their
homework
and
other
academic
assignments
this
would
be
counterproductive
since
students
need
to
have
enough
time
to
be
able
to
do
their
schoolwork
properly
it
would
also
detract
from
the
quality
of
instruction
as
teachers
would
be
more
rushed
and
students
would
lack
the
energy
and
concentration
to
absorb
the
lesson
many
students
have
plans
after
school
that
they
look
forward
to
they
involve
extracurricular
activities
or
simply
socializing
with
friends
these
activities
are
important
in
helping
to
develop
well rounded
individuals
coupled
with
this
is
the
need
to
have
some
spare
time
to
go
somewhere
whether
it
s
to
enjoy
a
hobby
pick
up
a
part time
job
or
just
to
get
out
of
the
house
adding
more
time
to
the
school
day
would
cut
into
all
of
that
finally
there
s
the
issue
of
being
bored
in
class
with
longer
school
days
we
would
be
subjected
to
even
more
tedious
lectures
and
discussions
such
an
atmosphere
would
not
only
further
reduce
the
quality
of
teaching
but
students
would
become
more
disgruntled
and
resentful
of
their
schoolwork
for
all
these
reasons
i
believe
that
the
school
board
should
not
add
more
time
to
the
school
hours
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
in
this
matter
after
conducting
my
research
i
have
identified
several
potential
extra curricular
activities
that
could
be
beneficial
to
my
academic
performance
family
life
hobbies
and
health
these
activities
each
offer
unique
skills
and
knowledge
that
could
be
useful
in
my
future
career
or
educational
goals
i
have
analyzed
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
as
well
as
the
time
commitments
they
require
with
this
knowledge
in
hand
i
plan
to
present
my
findings
to
my
parents
in
an
informative
and
logical
way
i
will
explain
the
potential
benefits
skills
and
knowledge
i
hope
to
gain
and
the
strategies
i
will
use
to
manage
any
potential
drawbacks
such
as
time
commitments
i
am
hopeful
that
my
parents
will
see
the
value
in
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
these
extra curricular
activities
and
will
grant
me
their
permission
graduating
early
from
high
school
can
be
a
great
opportunity
for
motivated
and
actively
engaged
students
who
are
looking
to
take
their
education
to
the
next
level
while
leaving
the
traditional
high
school
structure
may
come
with
some
drawbacks
there
are
also
many
potential
benefits
early
graduates
may
be
eligible
for
college
credit
may
be
able
to
access
more
school
choice
options
and
may
be
able
to
save
on
college
tuition
costs
by
finishing
their
schooling
more
quickly
additionally
there
may
be
additional
adult
opportunities
available
to
early
graduates
that
their
peers
who
stay
the
traditional
route
may
miss
out
on
however
early
graduates
face
increased
levels
of
responsibility
for
their
own
education
that
requires
more
planning
and
self direction
early
graduates
may
miss
out
on
traditional
high
school
activities
and
may
end
up
with
an
academic
gap
between
applying
for
college
and
leaving
high
school
especially
if
college
classes
or
advanced
coursework
have
not
been
completed
the
decision
to
graduate
early
from
high
school
should
not
be
taken
lightly
and
careful
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
ensure
that
the
best
decision
is
made
one
important
way
to
build
self confidence
and
self esteem
for
students
is
to
identify
and
focus
on
their
strengths
when
students
are
aware
of
and
take
pride
in
their
accomplishments
they
are
likely
to
become
more
self confident
and
have
higher
self esteem
teachers
can
play
an
important
role
in
helping
students
build
self confidence
and
self esteem
by
providing
support
encouragement
and
positive
feedback
and
celebrating
individual
successes
can
help
build
a
student
s
sense
of
worth
and
self esteem
i
recall
my
own
experiences
of
building
self confidence
and
self esteem
during
my
teenage
years
achieving
personal
goals
and
milestones
was
a
big
part
of
what
helped
me
develop
a
positive
attitude
towards
myself
and
take
pride
in
my
accomplishments
i
believe
that
accomplishments
are
meaningful
experiences
which
help
us
grow
and
develop
our
own
self esteem
reaching
a
goal
can
not
only
improve
our
skill
set
but
also
can
provide
us
with
an
increased
sense
of
accomplishment
and
the
ability
to
build
self confidence
i
am
writing
to
express
my
strong
support
for
as
a
candidate
for
the

an

years
of

their
diligent

and
willingness
to
go
the
extra

will
benefit
the

in
many
ways
they
understand
the
importance
of

efficiently
and
to
the
highest

so
quality

in

to
the
other

graduating
high
school
in
three
years
can
provide
many
opportunities
for
young
students
that
would
n t
be
available
in
a
traditional
four
year
high
school
program
graduating
at
an
early
age
gives
students
the
unique
opportunity
to
explore
higher
education
and
the
workforce
while
also
providing
valuable
time
to
build
real world
experience
one
great
example
of
a
successful
person
who
achieved
early
graduation
is
the
co founder
and
of
at
just
the
age
of
graduated
from
after
attending
high
school
for
only
three
years
although
made
a
habit
of
jumping
ahead
of
his
peers
he
states
that
he
only
considered
graduating
early
after
he
took
courses
during
his
high
school
years
high
school
graduates
also
have
the
option
of
pursuing
special
opportunities
that
open
up
to

earlier
if

many
universities
offer

scholarships
programs
to

some
high
schools
may
even
offer
special
degree
programs
that
allow
students
to
graduate
early
while
earning
college
credit
or
a
technical
certificate
finally
one
of
the
most
notable
advantages
for
young
students
who
choose
to
graduate
high
school
in
three
years
is
the
benefit
of
taking
a

a

for
young

students
that

to
taking
advantage
of
special
programs
and
resources
furthering
their
education
early
and
taking
a
gap
year
to
explore
new

failures
have
a
bad
reputation
but
in
reality
they
can
be
crucial
stepping
stones
on
the
way
to
success
when
faced
with
a
setback
the
power
of
enthusiasm
can
help
someone
take
it
in
stride
and
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
grow
and
learn
is
full
of
examples
of
successes
that
were
born
out
of
trials
and
tribulations
take
invention
for
example
famously
said
that
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
wo
n t
work
this
type
of
resilience
and
positivity
helped
him
create
inventions
that
have
made
a
huge
impact
on
the
world
from
the
light
bulb
to
the
phonograph
his
successes
wouldn
t
have
been
possible
if
he
had
let
his
failures
discourage
him
is
another
field
in
which
numerous
successes
have
arisen
from
prior
failures
after
a
series
of
failed
experiments
discovered
penicillin
which
has
saved
millions
of
lives
since
his
perseverance
combined
with
enthusiasm
for
his
work
enabled
him
to
turn
failure
into
a
chance
to
progress
and
succeed
the
same
principle
applies
to
students
who
often
experience
failure
in
the
form
of
poor
grades
or
lack
of
understanding
of
a
topic
by
continuing
to
give
their
best
effort
while
maintaining
a
can do
attitude
they
can
find
new
ways
to
grasp
concepts
or
work
around
any
obstacles
that
stand
in
their
way
ultimately
it
s
their
enthusiasm
that
helps
them
push
past
these
setbacks
and
benefit
from
the
lessons
learned
in
conclusion
enthusiasm
is
an
incredibly
valuable
resource
when
it
comes
to
learning
from
failure
and
achieving
success
from
s
light
bulb
to
s
penicillin
to
students
who
overcome
obstacles
to
excel
in
their
classes
there
are
countless
success
stories
where
enthusiasm
has
been
the
driving
force
rather
than
viewing
failure
as
a
large
setback
we
should
always
keep
in
mind
that
it
can
be
a
learning
opportunity
proponents
of
a
curfew
for
teenagers
in
our
city
argue
that
it
can
help
to
reduce
crime
and
delinquency
by
diminishing
the
amount
of
time
minors
spend
in
public
spaces
it
can
potentially
reduce
the
risk
of
harm
coming
to
them
or
of
them
becoming
involved
in
illegal
activities
moreover
a
curfew
can
provide
parents
with
peace
of
mind
in
knowing
that
their
children
are
at
home
and
safe
on
the
other
hand
opponents
of
the
curfew
policy
argue
that
it
may
be
too
restrictive
and
not
take
into
account
extenuating
circumstances
additionally
there
is
concern
that
it
may
have
a
disproportionate
impact
on
certain
demographics
such
as
low income
and
minority
groups
while
i
understand
and
consider
both
the
points
of
supporters
and
detractors
of
the
curfew
policy
i
believe
that
the
adoption
of
a
curfew
has
its
merits
by
enforcing
sensible
regulations
which
are
designed
to
ensure
the
safety
of
minors
we
can
collectively
help
to
curb
both
delinquency
and
crime
graduating
from
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
can
be
beneficial
for
certain
high
school
students
but
it
is
not
without
its
drawbacks
for
instance
district
high
schools
offer
special
programs
to
help
students
accelerate
their
coursework
and
graduate
early
however
some
students
who
have
graduated
early
via
these
programs
struggle
with
college
studies
because
they
have
not
had
the
same
level
of
instruction
or
time
to
adjust
to
a
college
learning
environment
as
their
four year graduating
peers
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
some
students
is
to
graduate
three
years
by
taking
online
classes
or
night
school
while
these
solutions
can
save
time
and
money
there
are
drawbacks
to
consider
for
instance
the
online
courses
may
be
more
difficult
than
regular
classes
and
the
night
school
may
prove
to
be
a
challenge
with
a
busy
schedule
furthermore
it
is
unclear
if
the
credits
earned
during
these
courses
will
be
accepted
in
four year
colleges
and
universities
and
the
level
of
instruction
received
in
these
settings
may
not
fully
prepare
students
for
college level
academics
ultimately
the
decision
to
graduate
early
should
be
an
informed
one
students
should
consider
all
the
available
options
and
research
in
detail
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
ultimately
the
success
or
failure
of
graduation
early
will
depend
on
the
level
of
personal
dedication
and
the
kind
of
support
the
student
has
failure
and
mistakes
can
be
difficult
and
frustrating
to
experience
but
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
them
if
we
take
the
right
perspective
when
we
make
mistakes
or
experience
failure
it
can
be
humbling
but
it
can
also
be
incredibly
rewarding
if
we
are
willing
to
learn
from
it
making
a
mistake
or
experiencing
failure
teaches
us
valuable
lessons
about
ourselves
and
our
abilities
we
develop
resilience
and
humility
and
learn
from
our
shortcomings
we
also
become
better
strategists
and
problem
solvers
since
we
have
already
experienced
failure
and
had
the
opportunity
to
think
critically
about
our
actions
learning
from
our
mistakes
or
failures
also
leads
to
a
more
positive
mindset
by
accepting
that
no
one
is
perfect
we
become
more
accepting
of
ourselves
and
more
realistic
in
our
expectations
it
also
helps
us
to
be
more
forgiving
towards
ourselves
when
we
make
mistakes
knowing
that
we
can
take
whatever
lessons
we
can
from
them
and
use
them
as
stepping
stones
to
our
success
in
conclusion
learning
from
our
mistakes
and
failures
is
incredibly
important
it
can
help
us
develop
our
resilience
problem solving
abilities
and
positive
mindset
though
it
can
be
difficult
and
uncomfortable
to
experience
failure
or
make
mistakes
it
is
essential
for
growth
and
success
in
life
being
honest
is
essential
for
both
individuals
and
society
helps
build
strong
relationships
and
trust
between
people
because
it
allows
them
to
be
open
and
vulnerable
with
each
other
without
worrying
about
being
deceived
on
an
emotional
level
being
honest
can
bring
a
sense
of
peace
and
comfort
knowing
that
one
s
words
actions
and
thoughts
are
true
on
a
larger
scale
honesty
can
help
society
by
promoting
fairness
justice
and
stability
when
individuals
live
their
lives
truthfully
they
are
less
likely
to
make
decisions
that
are
detrimental
or
damaging
to
the
collective
wellbeing
of
the
community
also
helps
cultivate
healthy
dialogue
by
enabling
all
parties
involved
to
express
their
thoughts
and
opinions
without
having
to
worry
about
being
misled
or

conclusion
honesty
can
benefit
people
in
many
ways
from

promoting
fairness
and
stability
in

volcanoes
are
a
powerful
and
destructive
force
of
nature
but
also
incredible
to
witness
volcanoes
are
caused
by
the
intense
heat
within
the
s
mantle
which
is
pushed
up
towards
the
surface
due
to
an
increase
in
pressure
resulting
in
molten
rock
erupting
such
violent
eruptions
can
have
a
devastating
effect
on
people
and
the
environment
with
lava
flows
consuming
homes
structures
and
in
some
cases
entire
villages
volcanoes
are
typically
composed
of
an
outer
shell
of
solid
material
that
has
been
explosively
ejected
around
the
opening
followed
by
the
inner
layers
of
rock
and
lava
despite
these
dangers
a
volcano
can
be
an
enjoyable
educational
activity
to
explore
and
appreciate
their
raw
power
with
the
right
preparation
and
guidance
from
volcanologists
and
other
experts
visitors
can
explore
the
inside
of
a
volcano
safely
and
discover
fascinating
geological
features
such
as
steaming
vents
and
volcanic
caves
by
understanding
the
power
of
volcanoes
and
marveling
at
the
beauty
of
their
geological
formations
we
gain
insight
into
the
workings
of
the
and
our
place
in
it
learning
something
new
each
day
is
important
for
personal
growth
and
development
doing
new
activities
can
keep
our
minds
sharp
and
help
us
be
more
open
to
new
experiences
in
addition
taking
the
time
to
help
others
in
our
lives
can
bring
much
needed
joy
and
satisfaction
as
once
said
the
purpose
of
life
is
not
to
be
happy
it
is
to
be
useful
to
be
honorable
to
be
compassionate
to
have
it
make
some
difference
that
you
have
lived
and
lived
well
for
example
taking
the
time
to
help
an
elderly
neighbor
by
running
errands
for
them
or
volunteering
at
a
local
food
pantry
are
two
ways
we
can
demonstrate
empathy
and
kindness
to
those
around
us
likewise
learning
something
new
such
as
a
language
cooking
a
new
recipe
or
learning
how
to
play
an
instrument
can
help
us
find
more
joy
in
everyday
life
and
develop
our
life
skills
by
taking
time
to
learn
and
help
we
can
bring
purpose
to
our
own
lives
and
make
a
difference
in
the
lives
of
others
for
my
artwork
i
have
created
a
vibrant
abstract
painting
which
reflects
my
cultural
heritage
on
the
canvas
i
have
used
a
variety
of
different
colors
and
textures
to
create
a
striking
composition
that
celebrates
my
cultural
influences
to
further
express
my
identity
i
have
added
details
of
symbols
and
words
which
are
unique
to
my
culture
through
this
painting
i
hope
to
showcase
my
artistic
potential
as
well
as
my
appreciation
for
my
cultural
roots
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
loved
to
read
about
courageous
adventurers
i
was
enthralled
by
stories
of
brave
princesses
on
long
and
treacherous
journeys
always
driven
by
a
steadfast
determination
to
achieve
their
goals
did
i
know
that
determination
would
become
a
quality
i
would
need
to
lean
on
when
dealing
with
the
many
obstacles
life
would
throw
my
way
at
the
age
of
my
parents
divorced
and
i
was
left
feeling
completely
alone
i
had
to
learn
to
manage
my
own
finances
while
still
focusing
on
my
schoolwork
this
was
no
small
feat
but
with
a
newfound
determination
to
create
better
opportunities
for
myself
i
persevered
i
worked
tirelessly
to
find
after school
jobs
that
allowed
me
to
save
money
for
college
it
was
difficult
i
encountered
numerous
obstacles
including
my
own
doubts
and
insecurities
however
my
determination
to
set
and
achieve
my
goals
kept
me
motivated
and
eventually
i
was
accepted
into
college
with
every
obstacle
i
faced
i
held
onto
my
determination
like
a
comforting
security
blanket
and
it
brought
me
to
my
ultimate
goal
it
is
through
my
own
experiences
that
i
have
learned
the
importance
of
determination
this
quality
has
helped
me
in
many
facets
of
my
life
from
reaching
personal
goals
to
overcoming
adversity
and
even
navigating
interpersonal
relationships
at
times
it
can
be
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
moving
forward
and
allows
me
to
accomplish
goals
no
matter
the
roadblocks
that
lie
in
my
path
parks
and
state
parks
offer
a
plethora
of
experiences
that
make
them
enjoyable
for
people
from
all
walks
of
life
firstly
parks
provide
access
to
outdoor
recreation
opportunities
that
may
not
be
readily
available
in
close
proximity
to
people
s
homes
in
addition
these
areas
of
nature
provide
a
chance
for
people
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
the
natural
world
as
well
as
the
cultural
history
and
diversity
of
the
surrounding
landscape
for
example
national
parks
in
the
states
have
been
designated
as
protected
areas
due
to
the
significant
number
of
species
of
plants
and
animals
cultural
artifacts
and
natural
features
they
contain
not
only
are
these
parks
places
of
wonder
and
beauty
but
also
centers
of
education
as
many
feature
interactive
displays
and
exhibitions
lastly
community
parks
and
state
parks
are
often
safe
spaces
for
people
to
connect
and
engage
with
members
of
their
local
community
these
areas
can
be
utilized
to
hold
public
events
or
simply
to
provide
a
space
for
people
to
come
together
creating
an
atmosphere
of
community
and
shared
experiences
throughout
american
history
the
push
for
active
thought
and
behavior
has
been
a
key
factor
in
our
nation
s
progress
from
s
famous
maxim
that
encouraged
citizens
to
never
put
off
until
tomorrow
that
which
you
can
do
today
an
active
and
industrious
spirit
has
been
fundamental
to
our
success
however
the
flip
side
of
this
mentality
has
been
the
risk
of
becoming
too
passive
and
idle
in
our
society
unfortunately
this
has
had
dire
consequences
more
than
once
leading
to
tragic
consequences
and
lost
opportunities
today
technology
has
made
it
easier
than
ever
to
live
an
idle
lifestyle
we
can
use
our
devices
to
make
our
lives
easier
and
put
off
taking
action
until
tomorrow
or
even
until
next
week
but
if
history
has
taught
us
anything
it
s
that
idle
behavior
comes
with
a
price
from
everyday
people
to
entire
nations
an
idle
lifestyle
can
often
lead
to
stagnation
which
often
leads
to
missed
opportunities
and
in
some
cases
a
complete
reversal
of
fortune
in
order
to
avoid
a
similar
fate
and
ensure
a
prosperous
future
active
behavior
must
remain
at
the
forefront
of
our
minds
taking
s
words
to
heart
we
must
not
be
afraid
to
invest
our
time
and
energy
into
something
today
rather
than
waiting
until
tomorrow
such
a
mindset
will
not
only
help
us
reach
our
individual
goals
more
efficiently
but
will
also
benefit
the
country
as
a
whole
so
let
us
take
his
words
as
a
reminder
to
stay
active
and
seize
the
day
so
that
we
can
create
a
better
future
and
leave
behind
a
lasting
legacy
technology
has
had
a
dramatic
effect
on
people
s
lives
in
modern
society
we
ve
gone
from
not
being
able
to
communicate
with
someone
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
to
being
able
to
send
messages
and
stay
in
contact
with
anyone
instantly
it
s
undoubtedly
changed
the
way
we
communicate
and
interact
with
one
another
and
it
s
made
our
lives
much
easier
in
many
ways
on
one
hand
technology
has
made
it
easier
to
connect
with
people
from
all
walks
of
life
media
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
find
out
more
about
each
other
make
connections
with
new
people
and
even
to
stay
in
touch
with
family
and
friends
who
may
be
separated
by
vast
distances
on
the
other
hand
however
technology
has
made
it
easier
for
us
to
overestimate
the
size
and
strength
of
our
human
connections
we
often
use
technology
as
a
crutch
to
maintain
contact
with
someone
but
do
n t
truly
make
an
effort
to
form
a
meaningful
relationship
with
another
person
that
extends
beyond
the
superficial
in
some
cases
technology
has
replaced
real
human
contact
and
this
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
meaningful
relationships
which
is
certainly
not
beneficial
for
anyone
overall
technology
has
had
a
huge
effect
on
how
humans
interact
it
s
undeniable
that
it
has
connected
us
more
than
ever
before
and
made
communicating
much
easier
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
technology
should
not
replace
real life
human
contact
and
interactions
and
that
it
should
be
used
in
moderation
to
maintain
healthy
human
relationships
after
extensive
investigation
into
the
effects
of
providing
an
additional
hours
to
each
school
day
there
is
an
abundance
of
evidence
that
supports
the
idea
that
providing
students
with
more
time
for
learning
helps
them
succeed
academically
for
example
in
high achieving
countries
such
as
and
students
typically
attend
school
for
far
longer
than
the
traditional
hour
school
day
in
the
education
system
consists
of
an
hour
school
day
which
has
been
linked
to
their
higher
academic
performance
to
supplement
this
research
i
conducted
a
personal
anecdote
by
interviewing
one
of
my
friends
who
is
a
senior
in
high
school
she
recounted
her
experience
when
she
was
given
too
little
time
in
class
to
finish
her
homework
she
shared
that
she
felt
pressured
and
overwhelmed
when
she
didn
t
have
enough
time
to
understand
and
complete
her
assignments
ultimately
affecting
her
performance
in
school
the
idea
of
adding
an
additional
hours
to
the
school
day
clearly
has
potential
long
term
benefits
for
students
and
is
supported
by
research
and
my
own
anecdotal
evidence
the
statement
your
character
will
be
what
yourself
choose
to
make
it
is
a
powerful
idea
that
is
worth
considering
it
implies
that
each
person
is
ultimately
in
control
of
their
character
and
behavior
and
it
is
their
decisions
that
determine
what
kind
of
person
they
become
however
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
this
view
ignores
the
fact
that
people
are
heavily
influenced
by
those
around
them
and
their
environment
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
their
character
for
example
a
person
may
be
raised
in
a
household
where
they
see
particular
behaviors
modeled
either
positive
or
negative
this
can
have
a
lasting
effect
on
their
character
as
the
things
they
observe
can
shape
their
beliefs
and
values
additionally
those
around
them
can
pressure
them
to
act
in
certain
ways
and
it
often
requires
strength
to
defy
these
pressures
and
stay
true
to
one
s
values
overall
it
is
important
to
remember
that
while
people
should
strive
to
be
in
control
of
the
person
they
want
to
be
they
must
also
recognize
that
the
environment
they
live
in
can
influence
their
character
significantly
it
is
possible
to
be
strongly
impacted
by
those
around
us
both
positively
and
negatively
and
it
is
our
decisions
that
will
determine
whether
we
are
actively
resisting
or
submitting
to
these
influences
positive
thinking
is
an
essential
tool
for
achieving
success
in
life
incorporating
a
positive
mindset
into
day to day
activities
is
a
surefire
way
to
create
a
lasting
impact
being
around
positive
people
listening
to
uplifting
music
and
participating
in
activities
that
involve
a
positive
attitude
can
help
focus
the
mind
and
make
you
more
open
to
achieving
your
goals
that
being
said
incorporating
positivity
and
optimism
is
not
just
about
surrounding
yourself
with
a
supportive
environment
it
s
about
believing
in
yourself
and
finding
the
strength
to
overcome
challenges
when
times
get
tough
this
type
of
attitude
can
encourage
you
to
keep
going
and
eventually
lead
to
success
with
a
little
effort
and
a
lot
of
positivity
you
can
conquer
anything
distance
learning
has
grown
in
popularity
in
recent
years
and
provides
a
world
of
opportunities
for
students
of
all
backgrounds
learning
allows
students
to
continue
their
studies
without
traditional
college
classrooms
making
it
ideal
for
those
who
are
balancing
full time
jobs
or
family
commitments
on
top
of
this
distance
learning
fees
are
usually
much
lower
than
traditional
classroom
tuition
for
some
these
financial
savings
can
be
critical
especially
for
those
without
a
financial
safety
net
for
older
students
seeking
to
finish
or
further
their
education
that
may
have
been
disrupted
due
to
various
reasons
distance
learning
provides
a
unique
environment
to
access
a
wide
range
of
courses
they
can
do
this
at
their
own
pace
allowing
them
to
complete
their
studies
in
their
own
time
moreover
with
the
support
of
online
resources
and
teachers
students
have
access
to
learning
materials
and
guidance
regardless
of
their
location
overall
distance
learning
provides
a
variety
of
advantages
for
students
especially
those
who
have
to
take
care
of
their
children
or
lack
significant
family
support
it
also
makes
tertiary
education
much
more
accessible
to
poverty stricken
areas
as
well
as
those
who
may
not
have
the

the
impact
of
distance
learning
on
students
is
undeniable
it
is
a
crucial
tool
that
empowers
individuals
to
pursue
their
educational
goals
the
potential
impact
of
the
use
of
social
media
and
technology
in
education
can
be
both
positive
and
negative
in
order
to
ensure
students
are
receiving
accurate
and
reliable
information
relying
more
heavily
on
textbooks
rather
than
potential
social
media
or
computer
sources
can
be
beneficial
some
reasons
why
textbooks
are
better
sources
of
academic
information
include
their
accuracy
reliability
and
appropriateness
textbooks
are
typically
vetted
for
accuracy
and
reliability
before
they
are
published
and
used
as
course
materials
meaning
the
information
they
contain
is
much
more
reliable
than
information
taken
from
social
media
or
computer
sources
additionally
the
content
in
textbooks
are
generally
age appropriate
and
avoid
the
potential
for
inappropriate
experiences
such
as
online
harassment
and
cyberbullying
the
potential
consequences
of
allowing
students
to
use
technology
and
social
media
in
schools
must
also
be
considered
the
use
of
technology
can
serve
as
a
distraction
reducing
the
amount
of
time
a
student
spends
on
their
schoolwork
additionally
it
may
create
issues
with
student
privacy
and
security
as
well
as
cause
problems
with
school
policies
on
the
use
of
technology
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
class
can
also
have
implications
both
for
the
students
and
for
the
school
on
a
positive
note
it
can
enable
students
to
have
access
to
the
same
resources
such
as
educational
videos
and
other
academic
materials
regardless
of
the
technology
available
in
the
classroom
on
the
other
hand
it
can
be
highly
distracting
causing
students
to
miss
key
parts
of
lectures
not
pay
attention
or
become
too
engrossed
in
their
phones
rather
than
paying
attention
to
the
classwork
finally
it
can
also
lead
to
a
disruption
in
the
classroom
making
it
difficult
for
teachers
to
adequately
control
students
use
of
technology
the
growth
of
technology
has
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
people
s
lives
in
the
century
this
impact
is
perhaps
felt
most
strongly
in
the
rise
of
online
technology
which
has
allowed
people
to
acquire
knowledge
and
skills
search
for
jobs
and
do
their
shopping
more
conveniently
one
of
the
advantages
of
online
education
is
that
it
s
now
easier
and
more
cost
effective
than
ever
for
people
to
access
quality
education
for
example
a
case
study
of
my
brother
s
online
courses
has
demonstrated
the
effectiveness
of
digital
learning
for
better
career
opportunities
the
development
of
online
jobs
such
as
being
a
or
investing
in
stocks
have
changed
the
way
people
work
and
made
professional
success
much
more
accessible
despite
the
potential
profits
there
are
associated
risks
as
well
lastly
online
shopping
has
completely
revolutionized
the
way
people
buy
and
receive
goods
popular
companies
such
as
have
made
it
incredibly
convenient
for
customers
to
order
and
receive
the
items
they
need
and
the
convenience
factor
and
competitive
prices
make
it
an
attractive
alternative
for
people
all
over
the
world
in
conclusion
the
growth
of
technology
has
made
a
huge
impact
on
our
lives
it
allows
us
to
access
quality
education
search
for
jobs
and
do
their
shopping
more
conveniently
with
more
online
services
and
options
available
for
customers

was
a
century
essayist
poet
and
philosopher
renowned
for
his
writings
on
the
importance
of
personal
growth
and
self reliance
his
quote
unless
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
embodies
his
beliefs
that
challenging
yourself
and
risking
failure
are
essential
for
real
growth
passion
is
an
integral
part
of
an
individual
chasing
success
and
growth
it
gives
a
person
enthusiasm
and
energy
to
keep
trying
even
in
the
face
of
failure
and
it
helps
them
overcome
their
fear
and
courageously
grasp
new
opportunities
on
the
flip
side
fear
and
stagnation
can
completely
impede
growth
and
progress
staying
in
your
comfort
zone
limits
your
chances
of
improving
and
achieving
something
by
trying
something
beyond
your
current
abilities
you
give
yourself
the
opportunity
to
expound
upon
what
you
re
already
good
at
it
not
only
tests
and
stretches
your
skills
but
it
also
encourages
you
to
pursue
new
ideas
and
opportunities
that
may
have
a
positive
outcome
through
this
traditional
trial
and
error
we
gain
knowledge
and
experience
and
are
able
to
become
more
competent
in
a
particular
field
or
activity
consequently
s
implication
that
we
must
make
an
effort
to
accomplish
something
beyond
our
known
abilities
holds
an
immense
amount
of
truth
and
is
an
important
reminder
to
keep
growing
for
many
students
the
idea
of
having
to
attend
a
full
day
of
school
can
be
overwhelming
day
school
plans
can
be
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
focus
on
their
studies
and
tend
to
other
commitments
that
may
occupy
their
time
outside
of
school
day
school
plans
also
give
teachers
the
chance
to
provide
more
tailored
educational
experiences
as
the
additional
free
time
students
get
from
the
half
day
plan
offers
them
more
options
to
explore
their
interests
and
engage
in
activities
that
can
supplement
their
learning
one
study
conducted
by
the
of
found
that
when
students
were
given
the
chance
to
attend
classes
in
a
half
day
format
their
test
scores
improved
significantly
the
students
who
were
part
of
the
study
also
reported
that
they
experienced
less
academic
stress
due
to
the
shorter
schedule
this
suggests
that
the
half
day
school
plans
can
be
beneficial
not
only
for
students
academic
performance
but
also
in
terms
of
their
overall
mental
health
another
benefit
to
half
day
school
plans
is
that
it
can
allow
schools
to
offer
more
electives
to
students
by
having
fewer
overall
school
hours
during
the
day
schools
can
dedicate
classroom
time
to
giving
students
more
access
to
different
types
of
classes
such
as
art
music
or
tech
this
gives
students
more
chances
to
explore
different
topics
and
interests
which
can
be
important
for
gaining
new
skills
and
further
developing
their
intellect
half
day
school
plans
can
be
beneficial
for
students
by
providing
greater
academic
opportunities
and
by
also
offering
more
free
time
for
students
to
study
explore
different
topics
and
focus
on
their
mental
health
by
advocating
for
a
half
day
school
plan
we
can
ensure
that
our
students
get
the
best
educational
and
personal
experiences
first
impressions
often
form
the
basis
for
how
a
person
is
perceived
and
treated
however
over
time
these
first
impressions
can
change
when
a
person
is
presented
with
friendly
relationships
and
support
networks
when
people
are
given
the
support
they
need
to
grow
and
develop
it
can
open
up
doors
and
help
them
to
challenge
their
initial
second guessing
of
themselves
through
the
right
friendships
and
relationships
both
parties
come
to
know
each
other
understand
each
other
s
good
and
bad
habits
and
support
each
other
in
times
of
difficulty
it
is
also
easier
for
people
to
improve
their
weaknesses
and
showcase
their
positive
attributes
when
their
relationships
offer
them
a
safe
space
to
do
so
through
these
relationships
a
person
s
impression
of
themselves
will
improve
as
will
the
impressions
of
those
around
them
the
decision
of
committing
to
a
career
while
still
in
high
school
can
be
a
daunting
one
sticking
to
a
certain
career
path
before
completing
high
school
can
certainly
bring
advantages
such
as
having
a
clear
direction
and
goal
to
work
towards
as
well
as
focusing
on
the
necessary
skills
and
knowledge
to
excel
in
that
area
on
the
other
hand
however
committing
to
a
career
at
such
a
young
age
can
be
incredibly
limiting
you
may
find
yourself
stuck
in
a
certain
path
for
longer
than
you
would
like
and
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
to
explore
different
career
options
furthermore
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
also
mean
sacrificing
important
skills
related
to
communication
teamwork
and
interpersonal
interaction
all
of
which
are
increasingly
important
for
success
in
the
modern
job
market
after
careful
research
of
the
options
available
to
reach
his
desired
goal
was
still
uncertain
to
make
sure
he
was
making
the
most
informed
decision
decided
to
talk
to
some
trusted
people
in
his
life
he
asked
for
their
feedback
and
advice
but
also
analyzed
the
potential
dangers
costs
and
other
available
information
he
weighed
out
all
his
options
and
after
carefully
considering
all
sides
of
the
decision
made
the
best
choice
he
could
through
a
study
of
the
program
s
effects
on
both
younger
and
older
students
it
has
been
found
that
introducing
it
into
the
classroom
can
help
students
of
all
ages
learn
the
importance
of
respect
regardless
of
outward
age
this
is
especially
beneficial
in
preparing
older
students
for
parenting
their
own
children
and
giving
younger
students
the
tools
to
better
deal
with
their
parents
upon
examining
the
program
more
closely
the
potential
life
long
benefits
that
can
be
provided
to
students
become
evident
students
are
not
only
taught
the
value
of
respect
but
also
receive
an
understanding
of
how
to
successfully
navigate
life
with
their
own
children
and
how
to
interact
in
meaningful
ways
with
their
parents
therefore
the
program
can
provide
crucial
life long
guidance
and
knowledge
to
students
that
will
prove
to
be
invaluable
long
after
graduation
throughout
history
some
of
the
most
productive
people
have
consistently
achieved
success
take
and
for
example
who
rose
to
fortunes
and
status
through
hard
work
dedication
and
responsibility
this
brings
to
attention
the
importance
of
getting
enough
sleep
being
responsible
and
working
hard
in
order
to
achieve
success
habits
like
bad
diet
inactivity
or
lack
of
discipline
can
be
severely
detrimental
to
achieving
goals
we
can
not
underestimate
the
power
of
even
the
smallest
of
steps
when
it
comes
to
achieving
greater
accomplishments
at
the
heart
of
it
success
is
something
that
simply
would
n t
be
possible
without
effort
no
matter
how
small
or
big
or
how
quickly
or
slowly
with
determination
and
consistent
hard
work
anything
can
be
accomplished
it
s
true
that
success
may
not
always
be
easy
but
it
can
certainly
be
achieved
s
famous
quote
not
go
where
the
path
may
lead
go
instead
where
there
is
no
path
and
leave
a
trail
serves
as
an
important
reminder
for
us
all
to
take
risks
and
break
away
from
our
comfort
zones
in
order
to
reach
our
goals
i
remember
my
own
experience
of
having
to
go
out
of
my
comfort
zone
in
order
to
achieve
a
certain
goal
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
wanted
to
join
the
school
s
robotics
team
but
the
team
was
run
by
my
biggest
rival
in
school
and
no
one
wanted
me
on
the
team
i
was
nervous
and
i
had
no
idea
how
to
approach
her
but
i
refused
to
let
my
fear
stop
me
from
trying
i
gathered
my
courage
and
reached
out
to
her
although
she
was
very
hesitant
at
first
she
ended
up
agreeing
to
let
me
join
the
team
i
eventually
ended
up
being
the
leader
of
the
robotics
team
and
we
won
the
championship
in
our
division
this
experience
taught
me
the
importance
of
s
statement
it
highlights
the
importance
of
taking
risks
and
going
out
of
our
comfort
zones
when
pursuing
our
goals
if
we
don
t
take
risks
and
break
away
from
our
comfort
zones
we
won
t
be
able
to
achieve
our
true
potential
and
make
our
biggest
dreams
a
reality
even
though
it
may
be
difficult
to
go
out
of
our
comfort
zones
it
s
worth
it
in
the
end
the
proliferation
of
technology
has
had
far reaching
consequences
on
our
present day
society
for
one
it
has
had
a
significant
negative
impact
on
the
ways
in
which
we
interact
with
one
another
as
well
as
on
the
new
generations
for
instance
rapid
advancements
in
technology
have
given
rise
to
increasingly
sophisticated
online
means
of
communication
such
as
social
media
and
instant
messaging
though
these
have
helped
to
bring
people
closer
together
it
has
also
resulted
in
an
ever growing
lack
of
face to face
interaction
as
such
the
means
of
expressing
our
appreciation
and
understanding
for
one
another
through
tactile
means
such
as
a
hug
or
hand
shake
are
becoming
increasingly
foreign
furthermore
the
ease
with
which
technology
has
been
integrated
into
our
daily
lives
has
come
with
numerous
risks
by
way
of
example
the
prevalence
of
spam
and
malicious
viruses
on
the
can
compromise
the
safety
of
our
personal
information
posing
a
serious
threat
to
our
identity
and
our
creditworthiness
in
addition
the
availability
of
technology
means
that
it
has
become
far
too
convenient
to
sit
and
be
entertained
rather
than
be
out
and
active
as
such
many
of
us
have
become
complacent
and
have
grown
too
comfortable
relying
on
the
television
and
video
games
to
keep
our
minds
occupied
in
conclusion
the
implications
of
technology
on
society
have
been
profound
it
has
caused
us
to
shy
away
from
personal
face to face
interaction
and
has
enabled
us
to
become
lazy
and
complacent
in
order
to
mitigate
these
effects
we
must
find
more
meaningful
ways
to
socialize
with
one
another
be
cognizant
of
the
risks
posed
by
technology
and
take
full
advantage
of
the
opportunities
it
provides
us
phones
have
become
increasingly
common
and
accessible
in
today
s
world
as
more
people
have
access
to
phones
and
technology
the
question
arises
of
whether
it
is
beneficial
for
students
to
have
access
to
cell
phones
in
classrooms
on
one
hand
phones
can
be
a
powerful
educational
tool
students
can
easily
access
information
such
as
textbooks
sources
and
online
simulations
without
having
to
carry
a
laptop
or
leave
the
classroom
they
can
also
keep
up
with
their
own
notes
presentations
or
other
activities
in
real time
without
having
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
school
day
to
type
them
up
additionally
cell
phones
can
provide
an
instant
connection
between
the
teacher
and
all
of
the
students
in
the
classroom
on
the
other
hand
allowing
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
can
be
a
distraction
not
only
can
social
media
be
a
major
source
of
distraction
but
students
can
also
be
tempted
to
text
or
call
their
friends
during
class
additionally
cell
phones
can
be
easily
misused
as
a
cheating
tool
with
the
availability
of
and
other
search
engines
students
may
cheat
on
tests
or
quizzes
by
looking
up
answers
on
their
cell
phones
in
addition
the
accessibility
of
cell
phones
during
class
can
also
lead
to
a
decrease
in
student
participation
which
is
an
important
part
of
learning
and
growth
allowing
students
to
use
cell
phones
in
classrooms
has
both
risks
and
benefits
on
one
hand
the
advantages
of
having
phones
available
for
educational
purposes
are
undeniable
however
it
is
also
important
to
discuss
the
drawbacks
and
consider
safeguards
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
misused
as
a
result
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
a
decision
about
whether
cell
phones
should
or
should
not
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
currently
there
is
a
policy
in
place
to
restrict
the
use
of
cell
phones
during
school
hours
while
this
policy
is
intended
to
ensure
teachers
and
students
can
focus
on
their
learning
it
has
proven
to
be
somewhat
ineffective
as
a
result
it
is
proposed
that
the
current
policy
on
cell
phone
use
in
the
school
be
revised
to
provide
a
more
balanced
approach
for
both
teachers
and
students
to
achieve
this
a
few
changes
should
be
implemented
teachers
should
be
allowed
to
carry
their
cell
phones
on campus
during
school
hours
this
will
allow
them
to
stay
connected
to
the
outside
world
and
provide
an
easy
means
of
communication
if
necessary
students
should
be
allowed
to
use
their
phones
for
educational
purposes
only
such
as
using
online
dictionaries
and
conducting
research
if
students
are
seen
using
cell
phones
for
any
other
activity
they
should
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
finally
stricter
enforcement
of
the
policy
should
be
in
place
for
instance
teachers
should
check
for
phones
during
examinations
and
if
applicable
confiscate
them
from
students
who
use
them
inappropriately
lastly
the
school
should
provide
information
to
both
teachers
and
students
regarding
the
revised
policy
so
everyone
is
aware
of
what
is
expected
of
them
by
introducing
these
changes
the
current
policy
on
cell
phone
use
in
the
school
can
be
revised
to
make
it
fair
and
effective
for
both
teachers
and
students
when
it
comes
to
forming
relationships
making
first
impressions
is
essential
people
often
form
impressions
of
each
other
within
seconds
of
meeting
this
includes
judging
things
such
as
clothing
hairstyle
body
language
and
the
tone
used
in
conversation
it
s
easy
to
make
a
first
impression
but
it
can
be
challenging
to
change
that
impression
afterwards
when
navigating
a
situation
like
this
one
strategy
is
to
find
reasons
to
have
a
second
conversation
this
gives
another
chance
to
make
a
favorable
impression
achieving
a
successful
connection
is
all
about
finding
common
ground
and
showing
genuine
interest
in
the
other
person
for
example
one
student
was
able
to
change
her
first
impression
on
an
interviewer
after
an
initial
conversation
went
badly
she
researched
the
interviewer
identified
common
interest
and
prepared
thoughtful
questions
to
get
the
conversation
flowing
she
made
sure
to
not
only
remain
engaged
throughout
the
conversation
but
also
demonstrate
her
knowledge
of
the
field
finally
although
making
a
positive
impression
is
important
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
it
is
not
everything
do
not
put
too
much
focus
or
attention
into
a
first
impression
as
it
can
limit
the
mutual
understanding
that
comes
from
further
conversation
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
everyone
makes
mistakes
and
should
be
given
chances
to
redeem
themselves
extending
the
school
day
is
not
a
good
idea
because
children
and
teenagers
need
time
in
the
evenings
to
relax
and
unwind
enjoy
the
time
with
family
and
pursue
other
interests
outside
of
school
studies
have
shown
that
students
become
increasingly
stressed
and
overwhelmed
when
their
schedules
are
stuffed
with
activities
increasing
the
time
spent
in
school
would
only
add
to
that
pressure
additionally
extending
the
school
day
would
prevent
after school
opportunities
such
as
jobs
recreational
activities
and
extracurricular
programs
these
activities
are
essential
in
providing
students
with
new
experiences
and
teaching
them
important
practical
skills
restricting
these
activities
would
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
develop
important
life
skills
finally
increased
school
hours
would
limit
family
time
which
is
incredibly
important
for
a
healthy
family
dynamic
family
time
allows
for
meaningful
conversations
and
strengthens
emotional
bonds
both
of
which
are
essential
for
a
successful
family
in
conclusion
extending
the
school
day
could
lead
to
less
family
time
fewer
after school
opportunities
and
more
stress
for
students
for
these
reasons
extending
the
school
day
is
not
a
good
idea
as
a
student
i
can
personally
vouch
for
the
fact
that
frequent
extended
breaks
from
school
would
be
beneficial
from
experience
i
can
attest
that
having
a
longer
summer
break
a
longer
winter
break
and
a
one week
break
in
the
spring
and
fall
would
unduely
help
students
in
multiple
ways
breaks
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
connect
and
spend
time
with
family
and
friends
during
breaks
i
have
the
time
to
hang
out
with
my
family
and
also
travel
these
experiences
provide
much
needed
time
away
from
the
rigors
of
school
and
studying
additionally
having
more
breaks
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
do
fun
activities
like
exploring
new
cities
or
trying
new
outdoor
hobbies
last
summer
i
was
able
to
take
a
road
trip
with
a
few
friends
with
the
additional
time
provided
we
were
able
to
get
to
destinations
and
explore
sites
which
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
with
a
two week
summer
break
by
providing
students
with
extended
breaks
from
schools
we
are
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
enrich
their
lives
outside
school
by
visiting
interesting
places
trying
new
activities
and
spending
time
with
friends
and
family
this
i
believe
is
an
invaluable
experience
which
is
made
possible
through
the
extra
time
schools
may
provide
students
with
by
granting
them
extended
breaks
online
classes
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
with
students
today
as
they
offer
several
advantages
over
traditional
classes
by
taking
classes
online
students
can
manage
their
own
pace
of
learning
as
many
courses
are
self paced
or
provide
more
flexible
deadlines
than
traditional
classes
there
are
also
more
options
available
when
it
comes
to
choosing
classes
allowing
students
to
tailor
their
educational
path
and
specialize
in
certain
areas
additionally
online
classes
provide
students
with
more
flexibility
since
they
do
not
have
to
travel
to
attend
class
sessions
and
can
take
classes
from
the
convenience
of
their
own
homes
however
there
are
also
a
few
potential
drawbacks
to
taking
online
classes
some
students
may
struggle
with
the
lack
of
face to face
interaction
with
instructors
and
the
lack
of
schedule
structure
online
classes
can
also
be
more
challenging
for
students
who
need
more
visual
and
hands on
instruction
additionally
there
may
be
more
difficulty
when
it
comes
to
collaboration
and
working
with
other
students
who
may
be
located
in
various
places
around
the
world
overall
online
classes
have
a
lot
of
potential
benefits
for
students
and
can
offer
a
more
convenient
way
to
learn
however
it
is
important
for
students
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
online
classes
before
making
a
decision
when
it
comes
to
making
important
decisions
neither
of
the
options
asking
for
guidance
from
experts
or
relying
solely
on
your
own
instincts
and
ideas
are
necessarily
better
than
the
other
it
all
depends
on
the
situation
and
the
individual
for
instance
when
i
was
trying
to
make
a
decision
about
what
college
to
attend
i
found
myself
relying
heavily
on
the
opinions
of
experts
and
other
people
who
had
been
in
a
similar
situation
before
although
i
valued
my
own
self reliance
hearing
experienced
perspectives
gave
me
valuable
insight
into
what
i
should
take
into
account
when
making
this
decision
this
allowed
me
to
make
a
more
informed
and
confident
decision
at
the
same
time
it
s
important
to
note
that
i
still
trusted
my
own
instincts
and
ideas
i
weighed
the
expert
advice
i
received
against
my
own
opinion
and
decided
which
one
was
best
for
me
it
s
always
okay
to
ask
for
help
even
if
you
value
self reliance
it
s
a
sign
of
strength
asking
for
help
can
help
you
make
the
best
decision
based
on
other
people
s
experience
and
knowledge
and
still
allow
you
to
rely
on
your
instincts
to
make
the
final
decision
one
potential
benefit
of
having
a
longer
school
day
for
high
school
students
is
that
they
would
have
more
time
to
learn
the
subject
material
with
the
extra
two
hours
students
could
spend
more
time
on
the
subjects
of
their
choosing
and
focus
more
on
making
progress
and
improving
their
grades
furthermore
additional
support
can
be
provided
by
teachers
who
can
devote
more
time
to
helping
students
develop
their
understanding
of
the
material
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
potential
disadvantages
associated
with
a
longer
school
day
students
may
face
added
stress
if
the
extra
two
hours
are
used
to
add
more
coursework
or
other
requirements
this
could
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
balance
their
school
work
with
extracurricular
activities
and
time
to
relax
additionally
a
longer
school
day
could
require
additional
resources
such
as
additional
staff
facilities
books
and
other
materials
this
could
result
in
increased
costs
for
the
school
and
parents
is
a
special
season
for
both
students
and
educators
on
one
hand
many
students
look
forward
to
long
summer
vacation
as
a
chance
to
relax
have
fun
and
explore
new
activities
many
educators
however
view
summer
vacation
as
a
well deserved
break
from
the
classroom
that
allows
them
to
spend
more
time
away
from
the
pressures
of
their
jobs
students
generally
enjoy
summer
vacation
because
it
s
a
break
from
schoolwork
and
everyday
obligations
allowing
them
to
take
some
time
for
themselves
during
this
period
students
have
adequate
time
for
leisure
activities
like
visiting
friend
s
house
going
shopping
playing
games
etc
furthermore
the
summer
offers
the
perfect
opportunity
to
pursue
an
extra
activity
like
an
internship
or
a
summer
job
these
activities
provide
students
with
valuable
experience
and
potentially
a
source
of
income
on
the
other
hand
some
educators
believe
that
summer
vacation
is
a
chance
to
recharge
and
find
a
better
balance
between
their
professional
and
personal
lives
summer
vacation
gives
them
a
chance
to
pursue
their
own
interests
such
as
traveling
engaging
in
hobbies
or
learning
something
new
it
is
also
a
period
for
catch up
work
such
as
lesson
planning
and
grading
which
may
not
be
possible
during
the
school
year
when
teaching
time
takes
priority
in
conclusion
while
educators
and
students
view
long
summer
vacations
differently
both
can
benefit
from
this
extended
break
students
use
the
time
to
explore
and
try
new
things
while
educators
are
able
to
recharge
and
catch
up
on
tasks
that
didn
t
happen
during
the
school
year
for
me
summer
vacation
has
always
been
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
pursue
creative
projects
and
spend
quality
time
with
family
and
friends
excerpt
the
implementation
of
a
four day
work
week
could
potentially
bring
about
a
variety
of
positives
and
negatives
for
students
workers
and
businesses
on
the
positive
side
students
and
workers
would
have
an
extra
day
free
to
use
for
leisure
educational
pursuits
or
other
productive
activities
which
could
potentially
increase
their
mental
and
physical
health
however
businesses
could
struggle
with
additional
costs
of
labor
changes
in
production
schedules
and
other
factors
while
a
reduced
work
week
could
have
numerous
advantages
it
is
important
to
carefully
consider
the
financial
and
operational
impacts
before
implementing
such
a
change
ultimately
the
decision
should
be
based
on
careful
analysis
to
ensure
that
any
potential
impacts
are
managed
and
minimized
when
it
comes
to
achieving
my
goals
i
know
that
i
must
create
a
detailed
plan
to
ensure
that
i
stay
on
track
to
make
this
plan
i
have
to
take
into
account
any
possible
obstacles
i
may
face
and
identify
different
strategies
to
address
them
furthermore
i
need
to
research
available
resources
to
aid
in
my
progress
once
i
have
everything
in
place
i
must
take
action
and
implement
the
plan
i
have
created
i
must
monitor
my
results
and
reassess
the
plan
regularly
to
make
sure
i
am
making
progress
and
to
adjust
if
i
need
to
this
way
i
can
make
sure
i
reach
my
goals
is
often
described
as
the
lens
through
which
we
view
the
world
indeed
having
a
positive
attitude
can
significantly
improve
our
daily
lives
from
the
way
we
approach
the
workplace
to
the
way
we
handle
relationships
it
is
no
wonder
that
so
many
prominent
figures
throughout
history
have
highlighted
the
importance
of
developing
a
positive
outlook including
who
famously
said
the
only
guarantees
the
american
people
the
right
to
pursue
happiness
you
have
to
catch
it
yourself
what
makes
a
positive
attitude
the
key
to
success
is
its
role
in
personal
motivation
for
example
a
study
from
the
of
showed
that
students
with
a
positive
attitude
about
taking
a
tough
math
course
achieved
better
results
than
students
with
negative
attitudes
regardless
of
their
level
of
intelligence
or
s
tested
the
effect
of
positive
thinking
on
athletes
and
found
that
successfully
imagining
the
act
of
completing
a
task
can
increase
motivation
in
our
professional
and
personal
lives
having
a
positive
attitude
can
open
the
doors
of
opportunity
this
is
because
positive
thinking
leads
to
optimism
which
can
improve
quality
of
work
thus
making
us
more
appealing
to
employers
or
allowing
us
to
achieve
our
goals
positive
attitude
is
undoubtedly
a
key
to
success
with
resilience
and
conviction
any
individual
can
develop
the
necessary
skills
and
knowledge
to
become
successful
but
it
is
the
attitude
that
makes
them
shine
a
positive
attitude
can
show
employers
and
colleagues
the
state
of
our
mental
health
and
resilience
towards
challenges
making
it
easier
for
us
to
take
the
steps
towards
a
brighter
future
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
more
so
in
the
past
few
decades
and
has
made
many
aspects
of
our
lives
simpler
and
more
efficient
however
while
technology
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
there
are
also
several
ways
in
which
it
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
and
our
society
one
of
the
main
issues
that
comes
with
increased
technology
usage
is
the
health
implications
it
can
bring
over
the
years
studies
have
linked
prolonged
exposure
to
screens
with
a
range
of
health
issues
including
poor
sleep
fatigue
eye
strain
headaches
and
more
screen
time
can
also
cause
people
to
become
more
sedentary
leading
to
adverse
effects
on
their
physical
health
another
way
technology
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
people
is
through
distraction
throughout
the
day
most
of
us
are
surrounded
by
notifications
alerts
and
messages
this
constant
influx
of
information
can
be
overwhelming
and
make
it
difficult
to
stay
focused
on
a
single
task
finally
technology
can
also
have
a
negative
social
impact
people
are
often
so
focused
on
their
digital
devices
that
they
neglect
face to face
interactions
this
can
lead
to
feelings
of
disconnect
loneliness
and
isolation
especially
among
young
people
in
addition
the
rise
of
digital
media
has
had
a
detrimental
effect
on
our
self esteem
with
so
many
idealized
images
and
videos
online
it
s
easy
for
people
to
become
disillusioned
and
lose
confidence
in
themselves
it
s
important
to
remember
that
while
technology
has
its
benefits
it
can
also
have
serious
drawbacks
it
s
important
to
be
mindful
of
our
usage
take
regular
breaks
away
from
digital
screens
and
maintain
a
healthy
balance
between
tech
and
real life
interactions
phones
have
become
a
hot
topic
when
it
comes
to
the
debate
about
whether
they
should
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
from
a
student
s
perspective
having
access
to
a
cell
phone
during
class
may
seem
convenient
but
others
argue
that
cell
phone
use
can
be
a
distraction
and
negatively
affect
their
academic
performance
while
some
believe
that
students
should
be
trusted
with
self control
when
it
comes
to
personal
phone
use
others
argue
that
even
small
distractions
can
add
up
and
hamper
learning
while
there
can
be
benefits
to
having
access
to
a
cell
phone
in
class
as
well
as
potential
drawbacks
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
educational
institution
to
decide
how
and
when
cell
phones
should
be
given
access
many
of
the
most
successful
people
in
and
the
have
each
achieved
phenomenal
success
through
the
combination
of
talent
hard
work
and
positive
attitudes
for
example
gained
fame
through
years
of
hard
work
in
broadcasting
that
was
powered
by
her
unique
perspective
and
positive
attitude
similarly
one
of
the
most
successful
athletes
in
history
achieved
greatness
through
his
talent
charisma
and
relentless
work
ethic
these
examples
show
that
success
does
not
come
without
effort
successful
people
have
a
drive
and
determination
that
allows
them
to
become
the
best
they
can
be
in
their
respective
industry
furthermore
these
people
display
a
positive
attitude
and
refusal
to
accept
failure
believing
that
the
harder
they
try
and
the
more
they
improve
the
more
successful
they
will
become
in
conclusion
a
positive
attitude
hard
work
and
talent
are
essential
components
of
personal
success
in
and
the
hard
work
and
dedication
to
excellence
any
person
can
make
their
dreams
a
reality
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
in
which
people
communicate
with
each
other
providing
individuals
with
an
array
of
novel
and
convenient
tools
to
stay
connected
on
the
one
hand
the
internet
and
social
media
platforms
make
it
easier
than
ever
before
to
keep
in
contact
with
friends
and
family
no
matter
how
far
apart
one
is
this
has
helped
bridge
the
geographical
divide
bringing
together
far flung
relatives
and
providing
a
sense
of
companionship
and
comfort
during
times
of
need
on
the
other
hand
this
ease
of
access
to
communication
and
social
networks
can
cause
withdrawal
and
distance
from
family
and
friends
in
the
physical
world
as
people
become
more
focused
on
their
online
lives
they
can
experience
a
disconnect
from
those
around
them
leading
to
feelings
of
loneliness
and
isolation
many
people
now
prefer
to
stay
at
home
and
interact
with
screens
rather
than
going
out
and
socializing
with
neighbors
and
friends
thus
increasing
the
prevalence
of
loneliness
and
depression
while
technology
can
be
a
powerful
tool
in
bringing
the
world
together
its
use
must
be
balanced
a
healthy
lifestyle
both
online
and
offline
requires
effort
and
vigilance
to
ensure
that
real life
relationships
are
not
neglected
in
pursuit
of
digital
ones
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
how
technology
is
affecting
one
s
mental
health
and
to
proactively
make
an
effort
to
reach
out
and
spend
time
with
friends
and
family
only
by
assessing
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
technology
can
we
truly
avoid
any
negative
effects
as
i
walked
through
the
hallways
of
hospital
i
felt
a
sense
of
admiration
for
the
doctors
nurses
and
medical
personnel
working
to
save
lives
and
improve
the
health
of
those
around
them
i
had
the
opportunity
to
interview
several
members
of
the
medical
staff
and
they
all
shared
their
experiences
of
how
being
a
doctor
is
more
than
just
a
job it
s
a
calling
they
spoke
about
the
importance
of
teamwork
and
collaboration
when
it
comes
to
saving
lives
they
also
argued
that
being
a
doctor
offers
a
great
responsibility
to
make
a
positive
impact
on
the
lives
of
others
through
my

short
summer
breaks
may
provide
a
number
of
advantages
to
students
such
as
the
opportunity
to
recharge
and
relax
for
a
few
weeks
leads
to
refreshed
minds
and
healthier
bodies
allowing
students
to
return
to
school
with
renewed
energy
and
enthusiasm
shorter
summer
breaks
like
week
long
holidays
enable
students
to
maintain
a
steady
learning
cadence
throughout
the
year
rather
than
having
to
absorb
large
capacities
of
knowledge
after
an
extended
holiday
winter
breaks
can
often
be
beneficial
for
students
to
enjoy
time
with
family
and
friends
as
well
as
providing
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
leisure
activities
and
mental
health promoting
activities
such
as
skiing
or
snowboarding
this
can
lead
to
students
feeling
calmer
and
more
focused
when
the
new
term
starts
having
a
short
week long
break
in
each
season
of
the
year
such
as
fall
winter
and
spring
can
help
to
refresh
relax
and
restore
both
the
mind
and
body
helping
to
promote
academic
success
one
potential
benefit
of
making
schools
year
round
is
that
students
may
retain
knowledge
for
longer
without
having
to
reinvest
in
the
same
topic
after
lengthy
school
breaks
leading
to
greater
learning
outcomes
and
better
long term
memory
having
a
more
balanced
learning
pattern
can
also
help
to
reduce
stress
experienced
during
peak
periods
such
as
exam
periods
and
motivation
levels
making
schools
year
round
could
have
a
number
of
potential
benefits
for
students
and
teachers
alike
providing
students
with
the
necessary
resources
and
opportunities
to
succeed
academically
while
also
promoting
a
healthier
lifestyle
with
such
a
change
school
holidays
would
need
to
be
structured
differently
but
it
could
provide
more
consistent
learning
opportunities
for
students
throughout
the
year
once
said
i
have
no
other
view
than
to
improve
our
success
by
keeping
the
utmost
vigilance and
resolving
never
to
be
discouraged
this
simple
yet
profound
adage
captures
the
concept
of
failure
to
failure
equals
success
which
implies
that
success
is
achieved
through
a
series
of
failures
indeed
many
successful
people
from
various
realms
of
life
have
found
success
despite
failing
multiple
times
take
for
example
the
story
of
media
mogul
who
was
once
fired
from
a
local
news
station
for
being
unfit
for
television
this
an
inflection
point
for
who
had
failed
and
was
ready
to
give
up
but
decided
to
keep
pushing
and
eventually
became
an
influential
figure
in
the
world
of
media
and
entertainment
her
mantra
became
your
wounds
into
wisdom
these
stories
show
us
that
success
is
achievable
even
after
multiple
failures
rather
than
giving
in
to
doubt
and
despair
people
can
find
strength
and
perseverance
to
continue
trying
until
success
is
achieved
as
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage

continue

nearly
year
career

always
accept
him
and
his
music

discrimination
to
being
overshadowed
by
white

musicians

a
number
of
obstacles
in
his
attempt
to

attitude
anyone
can
find
a
way

strengths

nothing

a
company
can

start

path

their
potential
i
still
remember
the
first
time
i
encountered
my
supervisor
in
the
office
at
first
i
was
too
intimidated
to
even
introduce
myself
properly
i
had
heard
about
her
from
other
colleagues
and
was
aware
of
her
strict
attitude
regarding
work
when
i
looked
into
her
eyes
i
suddenly
felt
the
pressure
to
step
up
my
game
and
be
more
productive
she
had
the
kind
of
impression
that
made
me
think
twice
before
i
acted
on
my
assumptions
it
was
not
just
the
way
she
looked
at
me
but
also
the
way
she
dealt
with
all
the
issues
that
made
me
adjust
my
attitude
i
realized
how
more
significant
relationships
and
inner
qualities
were
more
influential
in
a
person
s
attitude
than
first
impressions
my
previous
boss
made
me
do
things
with
the
utmost
care
and
diligence
while
my
supervisor
created
an
atmosphere
that
enabled
me
to
think
more
out
of
the
box
and
build
my
creative
skills
the
most
important
change
i
went
through
was
gaining
more
confidence
in
myself
and
my
work
before
this
change
i
was
always
stressed
out
and
scared
to
take
any
risks
with
the
help
of
my
supervisor
i
now
feel
more
prepared
and
able
to
take
on
risks
these
experiences
have
taught
me
important
lessons
and
it
has
certainly
shaped
the
way
i
treat
others
and
the
first
impressions
i
make
over
time
i
have
realized
that
it
is
essential
to
take
the
time
to
get
to
know
someone
before
making
any
conclusions
over
the
past
few
decades
technology
has
had
a
major
impact
on
people
s
lives
one
of
the
most
significant
changes
brought
about
by
technology
is
the
ability
to
complete
tasks
without
human
contact
from
online
grocery
shopping
to
hailing
a
taxi
through
an
app
there
are
plenty
of
activities
that
can
now
be
conducted
without
having
to
interact
with
human
beings
has
not
only
improved
convenience
for
many
day to day
tasks
but
also
enabled
new
pathways
for
learning
and
work
both
in
physical
and
digital
forms
can
provide
knowledge
and
entertainment
without
the
need
to
speak
with
another
person
games
used
in
the
right
way
offer
education
information
and
analytical
thinking
while
providing
an
immersive
experience
furthermore
the
internet
and
its
many
web based
resources
have
made
it
possible
to
learn
and
work
from
anywhere
in
the
world
in
conclusion
technology
has
allowed
people
to
complete
tasks
without
any
human
contact
while
also
offering
various
benefits
to
individuals
learning
and
work
whether
it
be
books
games
or
any
digital
resource
people
are
now
able
to
explore
knowledge
and
complete
tasks
in
ways
that
would
have
been
unimaginable
only
a
few
decades
ago
when
it
comes
to
having
someone
attempt
to
make
drastic
changes
to
our
personalities
it
can
be
a
difficult
and
often
confusing
topic
on
one
hand
it
can
be
helpful
to
learn
from
others
how
to
be
more
understanding
or
to
appreciate
a
different
perspective
on
the
other
hand
if
someone
is
trying
to
pressure
us
to
be
something
we
are
not
it
can
bring
about
negative
consequences
it
is
important
for
all
of
us
to
remember
that
we
all
bring
something
unique
to
the
table
we
should
not
feel
ashamed
to
express
our
individual
views
and
experiences
in
a
respectful
manner
furthermore
we
should
try
to
accept
the
differences
between
us
whether
we
agree
or
not
to
foster
healthy
relationships
at
the
same
time
being
open
to
constructive
criticism
is
beneficial
we
all
have
areas
in
our
lives
we
could
work
on
or
need
guidance
a
person
who
offers
feedback
or
suggestions
in
a
kind
and
patient
manner
should
be
seen
as
an
ally
attempting
to
better
ourselves
should
be
appreciated
though
we
should
be
wary
of
someone
wanting
us
to
change
just
so
they
are
comfortable
ultimately
it
is
best
to
strive
for
a
balance
between
embracing
new
insights
while
also
preserving
our
core
identity
we
need
to
be
accountable
for
how
we
conduct
ourselves
but
not
necessarily
cave
into
the
demands
of
another
person
as
individuals
we
are
all
faced
with
the
destiny
of
having
to
choose
our
own
character
traits
with
the
ever shifting
nature
of
the
world
it
is
vital
to
be
able
to
pick
what
elements
of
our
personality
are
ours
and
which
ones
we
should
discard
for
the
betterment
of
ourselves
and
those
around
us
the
victorian
biologist
sums
up
this
idea
beautifully
when
he
said
in
the
long
run
we
shape
our
lives
and
we
shape
ourselves
the
process
never
ends
until
we
die
and
the
choices
we
make
are
ultimately
our
own
responsibility
this
sentiment
is
strengthened
when
we
look
at
our
own
personal
experiences
it
is
all
too
easy
to
be
pulled
into
trends
and
succumb
to
societal
pressures
that
shape
our
character
but
if
we
step
back
and
take
our
lives
into
our
own
hands
we
can
decide
exactly
who
we
want
to
be
we
have
the
power
in
ourselves
to
pick
and
choose
the
traits
that
will
create
a
strong
and
positive
person
this
could
mean
never
settling
for
mediocrity
and
striving
to
reach
our
goals
and
push
our
boundaries
or
it
could
mean
never
giving
up
on
our
beliefs
and
maintaining
our
sense
of
integrity
it
could
also
mean
being
kind
and
compassionate
lending
an
ear
to
those
who
need
it
and
a
hand
to
those
who
are
struggling
ultimately
it
is
up
to
us
to
choose
these
traits
and
create
a
unique
life
full
of
potential
in
conclusion
it
bears
repeating
that
the
power
to
choose
our
own
character
traits
lies
within
us
we
have
the
power
to
shape
our
lives
and
our
character
with
this
power
we
can
choose
to
become
the
best
version
of
ourselves
a
bettering
of
our
previous
self
and
a
new
take
on
our
own
reality
despite
what
trends
society
or
anyone
else
may
try
to
impose
on
us
it
is
up
to
us
to
choose
our
own
character
and
live
with
the
consequences
of
our
actions
self esteem
can
be
achieved
through
a
variety
of
activities
that
focus
on
different
aspects
of
one
s
life
effort
and
behavior
all
have
an
impact
on
self esteem
by
building
strong
relationships
with
friends
and
family
forming
healthy
habits
and
taking
pride
in
the
work
that
one
is
capable
of
it
is
possible
to
feel
better
about
oneself
respect
for
oneself
is
an
important
factor
in
maintaining
self esteem
considering
one
s
actions
and
what
kind
of
impact
they
have
on
others
will
help
form
a
sense
of
self worth
being
mindful
of
how
one
is
treated
and
how
one
treats
others
helps
create
a
sense
of
security
making
a
conscious
effort
to
build
better
habits
and
take
ownership
of
one
s
behavior
is
also
necessary
for
self esteem
instead
of
taking
the
easy
way
out
putting
in
the
time
and
energy
to
get
the
job
done
is
an
effective
way
to
build
self confidence
along
with
this
comes
the
idea
that
even
if
mistakes
are
made
a
person
can
learn
from
them
and
be
open
to
the
idea
of
growth
and
improvement
education
can
help
build
self esteem
too
learning
new
skills
tactics
and
knowledge
can
lead
to
new
opportunities
and
experiences
learning
how
to
prioritize
tasks
and
develop
organizational
skills
will
lead
to
better
functioning
in
everyday
life
ultimately
having
a
sense
of
self esteem
comes
from
within
and
the
only
person
who
can
make
it
happen
is
the
one
taking
the
steps
necessary
to
make
it
happen
when
respect
for
oneself
and
others
effort
and
behavior
are
all
considered
it
is
possible
to
attain
a
healthy
sense
of
self esteem
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
s
statement
unless
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
the
ability
to
step
out
of
one
s
comfort
zone
and
take
on
a
new
challenge
is
essential
to
becoming
a
better
more
rounded
version
of
oneself
i
personally
have
experienced
this
firsthand
for
example
while
in
college
i
decided
to
branch
out
and
try
a
language
class
i
had
never
studied
before
japanese
i
had
never
taken
any
japanese
courses
before
nor
did
i
have
any
prior
knowledge
of
the
language
it
was
a
huge
undertaking
to
learn
an
entirely
new
language
and
i
experienced
numerous
setbacks
along
the
way
however
through
hard
work
and
dedication
i
was
eventually
able
to
get
a
handle
on
it
but
perhaps
more
importantly
through
conquering
this
challenge
i
gained
a
much
greater
appreciation
for
myself
and
my
abilities and
had
come
a
long
way
in
terms
of
personal
growth
similarly
in
my
professional
career
i
chose
to
take
on
a
project
that
i
had
never
attempted
before
i
had
to
learn
a
new
programming
language
and
adapt
to
other
unfamiliar
tools
i
encountered
many
roadblocks
during
this
process
but
the
experience
allowed
me
to
gain
a
much
greater
understanding
of
programming
and
develop
my
coding
skills
to
a
point
where
i
can
now
take
on
even
more
complex
tasks
trying
something
new
is
never
easy
and
there
is
certainly
no
guarantee
of
success
but
by
taking
the
plunge
and
pushing
my
own
boundaries
i
have
been
able
to
experience
great
growth
and
come
to
a
better
understanding
of
my
capabilities
therefore
i
fully
agree
with
s
statement
and
believe
that
pushing
oneself
to
try
something
beyond
what
one
has
already
mastered
is
the
only
way
to
truly
grow
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
has
many
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
in
many
cases
it
can
depend
on
personal
preference
working
in
a
group
can
be
advantageous
in
that
it
allows
for
more
ideas
to
come
together
leading
to
positive
outcomes
in
addition
more
tasks
can
get
completed
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
when
two
or
more
people
work
together
however
there
are
also
some
potential
disadvantages
to
working
in
a
group
such
as
personality
clashes
and
arguments
these
issues
can
lead
to
tensions
among
the
group
members
and
potentially
impede
progress
it
is
important
to
consider
that
working
in
a
group
or
working
alone
both
have
benefits
and
drawbacks
and
that
it
may
depend
on
personal
preferences
when
it
comes
to
deciding
which
option
is
best
playing
outside
can
be
great
for
your
wellbeing
both
physical
and
mental
research
suggests
that
spending
time
in
nature
and
engaging
in
outdoor
activities
can
lead
to
decreased
stress
levels
improved
mood
and
feelings
of
rejuvenation
and
calm
in
particular
spending
time
in
nature
with
friends
can
be
especially
beneficial
studies
have
shown
that
interactions
with
others
can
lead
to
improved
social
mental
and
physical
health
while
activities
such
as
playing
catch
fishing
or
flying
a
kite
can
reduce
stress
levels
and
lead
to
positive
emotions
by
taking
the
time
to
get
out
into
nature
with
friends
and
engage
in
activities
you
can
reduce
stress
and
improve
your
overall

enforcing
a
curfew
for
teenagers
can
have
numerous
positive
impacts
that
ripple
throughout
families
local
government
society
and
schools
firstly
a
curfew
can
have
an
especially
positive
effect
on
families
teenagers
have
curfews
set
in
place
families
can
feel
more
secure
that
their
children
are
in
safe
environments
and
are
not
engaging
in
risky
activities
curfews
can
also
help
to
ensure
that
children
are
completing
their
homework
and
getting
adequate
rest
leading
to
positive
relationships
between
families
local
government
can
also
benefit
from
the
enforcement
of
curfews
for
teens
by
requiring
teenagers
to
be
in
their
homes
by
a
certain
time
of
night
this
decreases
the
chances
of
teens
participating
in
illegal
activities
such
as
underage
drinking
and
drug
use
similarly
it
helps
to
decrease
traffic
related
incidents
which
can
have
considerable
impacts
on
a
local
community
the
positive
impacts
of
enforcing
curfews
for
teenagers
can
also
be
felt
more
broadly
in
society
as
teens
have
a
greater
sense
of
structure
and
security
this
encourages
stronger
communities
to
form
within
a
society
curfews
can
also
help
to
ensure
that
teens
are
not
disrupting
their
local
neighborhoods
with
loud
music
or
unruly
behavior
after
dark
finally
enforcing
curfews
for
teens
can
have
positive
impacts
for
schools
as
teens
comply
with
a
curfew
this
ensures
that
they
are
able
to
attend
school
on
time
and
refreshed
and
are
better
able
to
focus
and
achieve
their
academic
goals
additionally
setting
a
curfew
can
help
to
promote
a
positive
school
culture
that
promotes
respect
and
encourages
teens
to
take
their
studies
and
future
goals
seriously
in
conclusion
the
enforcement
of
curfews
for
teenagers
can
have
a
range
of
positive
impacts
from
a
more
secure
family
environment
to
a
stronger
school
culture
as
a
result
setting
curfews
can
be
an
effective
tool
in
helping
teenagers
to
stay
safe
secure
and
academically
successful
gaining
success
in
life
is
an
attainable
reality
with
hard
work
and
clear
goals
and
dedication
are
key
in
order
to
achieve
great
things
this
can
be
seen
in
the
many
examples
of
individuals
who
have
accomplished
extraordinary
things
through
determination
and
perseverance
people
like
who
led
a
successful
nonviolent
resistance
against
british
colonial
forces
to
achieve
s
independence
and
who
built
into
one
of
the
world
s
most
successful
companies
are
examples
of
those
who
have
attained
remarkable
success
at
the
heart
of
these
accomplishments
is
an
inspirational
drive
to
succeed
it
is
undeniable
that
having
a
supportive
family
and
a
community
of
friends
can
help
an
individual
achieve
their
goals
as
well
it
is
often
said
that
no
one
reaches
the
peak
of
success
alone
having
a
supportive
network
to
provide
comfort
and
encouragement
can
give
the
extra
push
needed
to
reach
lofty
heights
in
general
it
is
possible
to
accomplish
great
things
in
life
with
hard
work
clear
objectives
and
the
help
of
family
and
friends
those
who
have
done
so
are
living

that
hard

and
determination
can
pay
off
and
lead
to
remarkable
success
the
implementation
of
a
curfew
law
for
teenagers
is
a
highly
debated
topic
supporters
of
a
curfew
law
claim
that
it
can
help
decrease
juvenile
crime
improve
public
safety
and
help
young
people
focus
on
studies
and
other
extracurricular
activities
opponents
of
the
law
contend
that
it
is
an
infringement
of
civil
liberties
and
can
potentially
be
damaging
to
the
relationship
and
trust
between
parents
and
teenagers
additionally
there
is
also
concern
that
a
curfew
law
could
disproportionately
affect
teens
of
color
in
order
to
effectively
evaluate
the
pros
and
cons
of
implementing
a
curfew
law
for
teenagers
in
a
given
city
it
is
important
to
consider
the
implications
of
the
law
its
potential
effects
on
teenagers
and
how
it
would
be
enforced
it
is
also
essential
to
consider
the
potential
effects
on
the
relationship
between
youth
and
law
enforcement
the
financial
impact
it
may
have
on
city
budgets
and
how
the
law
would
be
viewed
by
community
members
ultimately
the
decision
to
implement
a
curfew
law
should
not
be
taken
lightly
and
should
be
carefully
considered
before
taking
effect
self reliance
is
an
invaluable
trait
that
can
empower
people
to
make
their
own
decisions
and
seize
control
of
their
own
lives
people
should
strive
to
be
independent
and
self sufficient
but
it
is
also
important
to
consider
when
it
is
wise
to
seek
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
after
all
there
are
a
multitude
of
factors
that
can
influence
decisions
so
it
is
often
beneficial
to
draw
from
the
insights
and
experience
of
those
who
have
come
before
us
ultimately
it
is
up
to
each
person
to
consider
the
value
of
self reliance
and
make
the
decision
that
best
suits
their
individual
situation
making
a
good
first
impression
is
essential
in
any
situation
as
it
sets
the
tone
for
any
subsequent
interactions
a
person
can
influence
the
impression
they
make
through
subtle
yet
important
elements
of
their
appearance
including
facial
expression
personal
hygiene
and
attire
a
person
s
facial
expression
can
be
a
great
indicator
of
their
attitude
and
can
be
extremely
influential
when
making
a
first
impression
a
relaxed
confident
expression
communicates
an
open
and
sincere
vibe
while
a
frown
or
grimace
communicates
tension
or
anger
personal
hygiene
is
also
a
big
factor
in
first
impressions
people
often
judge
someone
based
on
their
appearance
including
grooming
and
proper
hygiene
or
disheveled
hair
stained
clothing
and
body
odor
for
example
can
all
give
off
a
negative
or
sloppy
vibe
finally
attire
has
a
big
impact
in
a
person
s
first
impression
as
well
wearing
high quality
clothing
that
fits
properly
can
create
a
professional
and
reliable
image
mismatched
or
disheveled
clothes
can
give
off
a
messy
or
disorganized
impression
overall
the
way
in
which
a
person
presents
themselves
can
have
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
impression
they
make
attention
to
facial
expression
personal
hygiene
and
attire
can
all
contribute
to
a
positive
initial

one
of

life
it
can
be
seen
through
the
physical
mental
and
emotional
changes
that
people
experience
throughout
their
life
but
more
than
just
being
a
natural
part
of
life
growth
is
also
something
that
requires
dedication
and
effort
to
attain
people
must
be
actively
involved
in
the
process
of
personal
development
whether
through
intellectual
pursuits
creative
expression
or
forging
meaningful
connections
people
must
seek
out
opportunities
to
grow
and
be
open
to
the
change
that
comes
along
with
it
by
doing
this
they
will
be
more
able
to

the
growth
that
they
encounter
to
become
the
best
version
of
themselves
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
success
in
life
it
impacts
not
only
how
we
interact
with
those
around
us
but
how
we
perceive
and
overcome
obstacles
a
positive
attitude
allows
us
to
approach
every
situation
with
optimism
rather
than
fear
or
pessimism
and
this
can
make
a
significant
difference
in
our
lives
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
form
better
relationships
with
other
people
when
we
view
interactions
with
others
in
a
positive
light
we
are
more
likely
to
understand
their
point
of
view
and
approach
them
with
empathy
and
kindness
in
contrast
a
negative
attitude
can
lead
to
conflict
and
further
alienation
from
those
we
care
about
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
to
approach
problems
in
a
constructive
way
rather
than
wallowing
in
self doubt
or
giving
up
when
faced
with
difficulty
a
positive
attitude
encourages
us
to
have
faith
in
our
own
abilities
and
take
action
a
positive
outlook
enables
us
to
realize
that
failure
is
not
always
the
end
of
the
story
and
that
often
it
is
possible
to
learn
and
grow
even
in
the
face
of
adversity
there
is
a
big
difference
between
positive
and
negative
attitudes
a
negative
attitude
causes
us
to
focus
on
only
the
bad
aspects
of
a
situation
whereas
a
positive
attitude
allows
us
to
see
the
potential
for
good
even
in
the
most
challenging
circumstances
this
in
turn
can
make
it
easier
to
find
solutions
to
difficult
problems
rather
than
viewing
them
as
insurmountable
challenges
lastly
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
us
to
achieve
our
goals
and
be
happier
overall
when
we
approach
life
with
a
positive
attitude
we
start
with
the
premise
that
we
can
achieve
our
goals
and
strive
for
success
we
also
open
ourselves
up
to
all
of
the
potential
for
joy
life
has
to
offer
which
can
lead
to
a
feeling
of
greater
wellbeing
in
conclusion
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
success
in
life
it
affects
our
relationships
how
we
view
and
solve
problems
and
the
likelihood
of

to
success
are
varied
some
believe
failure
to
be
synonymous
with
personal
or
career
stagnation

a
necessary
learning
experience
whatever
one

have
both
a
positive
and
negative
impact
on
one
s
overall
success

not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage

critical
role

both
failures

enthusiasm
when
it

the
importance
of
perseverance

side
of

a
more
hopeful
outlook
and
the
determination
to
reach
our
goals
optimistic
about
life
encourages
us
to
take
risks
and
reach
beyond
what
we
thought
was
possible
it
can
give
us
the
courage
to
break
out
of
our
comfort
zone
and
open
up
new
opportunities
for
us
with
a
positive
attitude
we
are
also
better
able
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
failures
every
personal
setback
can
become
an
opportunity
for
development
and
growth
when
looked
at
with
a
positive
outlook
having
a
positive
attitude
also
helps
us
to
build
strong
relationships
with
others
people
are
more
willing
to
work
with
and
lend
support
to
someone
who
is
positive
and
has
a
sunny
disposition
even
in
difficult
situations

and
open
the
door
for

collaborations
positive
attitude
is
the
key
to
success
in
life
it
provides
us
with
the
courage
and
determination
to
overcome
life
s
challenges
take
risks
and
learn
from
our
experiences
with
a
positive
attitude
the
possibilities
are
endless
recent
events
in
our
society
have
highlighted
the
importance
of
trusting
our
own
judgment
rather
than
relying
solely
on
the
advice
of
so called
experts
being
able
to
think
independently
and
look
at
the
unique
aspects
of
a
situation
is
increasingly
becoming
the
best
way
to
make
decisions
this
is
never
more
evident
than
in
the
realm
of
self actualization
where
the
individual
is
unique
and
is
often
best suited
to
make
decisions
on
their
own
behalf
for
example
the
career
path
chosen
by
an
individual
should
primarily
be
based
on
the
personal
goals
and
values
of
the
individual
relying
on
generic
career
advice
from
an
expert
can
lead
to
outcomes
that
do
not
best
reflect
the
individual
s
interests
and
potential
similarly
when
making
decisions
about
which
products
or
services
to
purchase
taking
into
account
personal
preference
and
value based
judgments
can
often
lead
to
better
decisions
than
relying
on
expert
advice
on
the
other
hand
however
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
being
independent
does
not
always
equate
with
being
correct
making
autonomous
decisions
should
always
involve
considering
the
potential
negative
outcomes
failing
to
do
so
can
lead
to
disastrous
results
sometimes
even
worse
than
blindly
following
expert
advice
therefore
it
is
essential
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
any
decision
made
before
going
ahead
ultimately
learning
to
trust
our
own
judgement
is
a
valuable
life
skill
but
it
should
never
be
done
without
the
appropriate
caution
self motivation
is
an
important
component
of
success
to
understand
how
to
achieve
it
one
first
has
to
look
at
the
stories
of
those
who
have
already
found
success
in
life
many
successful
people
have
had
to
overcome
obstacles
to
reach
their
goals
and
this
has
opened
the
way
for
demonstrating
remarkable
levels
of
self motivation
not
only
do
these
people
have
positive
attitudes
to
drive
them
but
they
have
also
learned
to
stay
committed
to
their
goals
no
matter
how
difficult
or
lengthy
the
journey
may
be
school
and
homework
are
also
crucial
elements
in
the
pursuit
of
success
individuals
who
have
reached
success
in
their
lives
often
attribute
this
success
to
having
done
well
in
school
and
having
put
in
hard
work
and
dedication
to
their
studies
they
internalized
their
motivation
to
do
better
working
hard
to
acheive
academic
excellence
this
proves
that
attitude
and
commitment
play
a
major
role
in
success
having
a
positive
outlook
can
also
inspire
others
to
strive
for
their
own
goals
when
people
see
someone
succeeding
it
can
spark
the
motivation
they
need
to
pursue
their
dreams
and
push
their
limits
self motivation
is
a
trait
that
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
person
s
success
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
the
key
to
unlocking
many
accomplishments
in
life
it
can
be
a
source
of
inspiration
and
motivation
for
achieving
many
goals
and
dreams
give
us
the
power
to
strive
for
greatness
and
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
can
help
us
work
toward
our
goals
at
the
same
time
however
there
is
an
opposing
view
that
states
that
one
s
greatest
accomplishments
are
those
that
come
from
being
and
expressing
oneself
in
the
world
it
s
important
to
consider
that
what
might
be
the
greatest
accomplishment
for
one
person
might
not
be
for
another
and
that
pursuing
one
s
goals
with
strength
and
perseverance
is
also
a
vital
part
of
achieving
success
ultimately
what
is
most
important
is
being
true
to
oneself
and
having
the
courage
and
resolve
to
strive
for
our
goals
no
matter
how
small
or
grand
these
may
be
through
having
a
positive
attitude
dreaming
big
and
staying
true
to
oneself
we
can
reach
many
great
accomplishments
and
be
the
greatest
that
we
can
be
many
great
inventors
such
as
and
have
attributed
their
success
to
hard
work
and
persistence
they
believed
that
if
you
work
on
something
every
day
eventually
you
will
succeed
their
lives
have
provided
us
with
numerous
examples
of
how
constant
work
and
effort
can
help
you
reach
your
goals
similarly
many
companies
have
achieved
success
by
continuously
striving
to
improve
their
products
services
and
processes
furthermore
staying
still
and
inactive
can
sometimes
be
beneficial
as
well
it
can
give
you
time
to
reflect
on
your
work
consider
ideas
and
devise
a
plan
of
action
allows
you
to
be
creative
and
thoughtful
when
it
comes
to
your
work
these
examples
demonstrate
how
important
hard
work
and
practice
are
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
research
shows
that
the
more
effort
you
put
into
something
the
more
likely
you
are
to
experience
positive
results
this
supports
the
popular
saying
makes
perfect
the
famous
words
of
that
we
must
not
let
our
passions
destroy
our
reason
emphasize
the
importance
of
self discipline
and
taking
action
in
order
to
achieve
goals
and
make
a
positive
difference
in
the
lives
of
others
there
are
various
avenues
one
can
take
to
help
those
in
need
donating
money
or
supplies
volunteering
time
and
energy
educating
oneself
on
the
issues
and
participating
in
advocacy
these
efforts
not
only
make
a
lasting
beneficial
impact
on
those
being
helped
but
they
can
also
empower
us
to
realize
our
own
potential
and
lead
to
personal
growth
when
we
take
these
actions
it
can
inspire
others
to
join
us
in
these
efforts
and
encourage
them
to
take
on
projects
that
they
care
about
and
make
the
world
a
brighter
place

for
those

truly
essential
and
is
a
necessary

an
important
part
of
leading
a
good
life

a
positive
impact

something
that

spread
around
the

can
be
built

be
strengthened
and
eventually
a
better
world
can
be
created
it
is
also
important
to

that

not
just
impact
people
but
also
other
living
beings
showing
respect
and
care
for
animals
can
have
a
positive
impact

in
conclusion
showing
kindness
to
others
is
important
for
achieving
a
positive
outlook
on
life
as
well
as
cultivating
good
relationships
with
those
around
us
it
can
also
be
a
powerful
force
for
creating
a
better
world
both
for
humans
and
other
living
creatures
in
the
modern
era
cell
phone
use
in
school
has
become
commonplace
while
it
is
undeniable
that
cell
phones
have
become
integral
tools
in
our
daily
lives
their
presence
in
educational
settings
has
raised
some
concerning
questions
should
cell
phones
be
allowed
in
the
classroom
some
argue
that
cell
phones
can
be
a
useful
learning
tool
allowing
students
to
quickly
access
online
resources
and
stay
connected
with
their
peers
unfortunately
this
logic
overlooks
the
far
more
pressing
issue
of
cell
phone
use
as
a
distraction
whether
we
realize
it
or
not
cell
phones
are
a
dangerous
gateway
into
an
endless
array
of
social
media
gaming
and
entertainment
options
even
if
a
student
has
resisted
the
urge
to
waste
their
time
their
peers
may
not
have
whether
it
s
checking
one
s
notifications
or
carelessly
playing
games
having
cell
phones
in
a
classroom
environment
encourages
a
culture
of
disruption
and
inattentiveness
in
addition
to
being
a
distraction
cell
phones
can
also
be
a
security
hazard
with
the
sheer
amount
of
sensitive
data
stored
on
phones
bringing
them
into
a
school
environment
exposes
students
and
staff
to
an
increased
risk
of
cyberbullying
cheating
and
identity
theft
in
the
faintest
possible
scenario
the
presence
of
cellular
devices
can
also
encourage
physical
theft
and
other
vulnerabilities
for
these
reasons
there
is
a
distinct
need
to
protect
student
safety
by
limiting
or
altogether
banning
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
school
special
circumstances
a
school
should
maintain
the
environment
it
has
been
tasked
to
maintain
a
space
for
students
to
learn
without
outside
distraction
or
risk
only
then
can
students
fully
maximize
their
education
and
achieve
the
success
they
have
been
striving
for
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
essential
for
success
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
can
enable
us
to
push
through
any
obstacle
we
face
and
can
open
new
doors
of
opportunity
to
us
i
personally
have
experienced
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
positive
attitude
in
life
following
a
difficult
period
of
time
in
college
i
was
ready
to
give
up
and
resign
to
failure
however
with
the
help
of
family
and
friends
who
encouraged
me
to
remain
positive
i
was
able
to
do
better
in
my
career
instead
of
blaming
myself
and
being
consumed
by
negative
thoughts
i
looked
for
opportunities
and
was
eventually
offered
an
amazing
job
another
example
to
show
the
importance
of
positivity
is
a
story
of
someone
we
all
know
despite
poverty
cultural
differences
and
other
difficulties
her
positive
attitude
helped
her
succeed
in
her
studies
and
eventually
win
a
in
science
without
her
determination
and
never quit
spirit
she
would
never
have
been
able
to
reach
such
great
heights
in
conclusion
it
is
evident
that
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
crucial
for
success
will
always
throw
a
few
lemons
our
way
but
by
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
and
outlook
we
will
be
better
equipped
to
handle
them
we
can
use
personal
experiences
and
stories
of
people
who
succeeded
in
spite
of
difficulty
to
remind
ourselves
why
positivity
is
important
in
life
extracurricular
activities
have
been
widely
studied
in
relation
to
student
educational
outcomes
and
the
opinions
of
parents
has
shown
that
students
who
participate
in
organized
extracurricular
activities
tend
to
demonstrate
improved
academic
performance
and
greater
interest
in
learning
at
the
same
time
parents
often
become
involved
in
their
children
s
extracurricular
activities
providing
further
support
for
academic
achievement
however
extracurricular
activities
can
also
have
negative
effects
particularly
when
students
participate
in
too
much
activity
a
lack
of
sleep
poor
nutrition
and
increased
stress
can
all
lead
to
burnout
and
decreased
school
performance
over scheduling
students
can
also
have
detrimental
effects
on
their
physical
and
mental
health
finally
introducing
incentive
rules
for
extracurricular
activities
in
a
school
system
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
the
positive
side
incentives
can
help
to
increase
participation
in
extracurricular
activities
and
may
help
to
further
stimulate
the
academic
performance
of
students
however
they
can
also
encourage
competition
and
competition related
stress
in
students
leading
to
lower
self esteem
and
decreased
academic
performance
completing
a
college
degree
can
provide
a
number
of
benefits
an
education
can
give
us
access
to
better
job
opportunities
higher
incomes
and
a
chance
to
pursue
career
paths
that
were
previously
impossible
but
with
rising
tuition
costs
student
loan
debt
and
other
expenses
attending
college
can
be
expensive
fortunately
there
are
a
number
of
options
available
to
help
financially
support
yourself
while
in
college
from
scholarships
and
grants
to
work study
and
part time
jobs
there
are
ways
to
pay
for
tuition
and
other
expenses
in
addition
to
financial
help
it
s
important
to
have
confidence
and
structure
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
your
college
experience
setting
achievable
goals
and
limiting
procrastination
can
help
to
boost
your
confidence
and
take
the
stress
out
of
school
it
s
also
important
to
be
aware
of
the
responsibilities
that
come
with
attending
college
it
s
important
to
manage
your
time
wisely
and
be
efficient
with
your
money
it
s
also
essential
to
consider
the
emotional
toll
of
college
and
what
you
owe
to
yourself
and
your
family
in
terms
of
support
finally
for
those
without
a
family
or
a
place
to
stay
there
are
numerous
resources
available
from
housing
assistance
and
food
pantries
to
emergency
assistance
and
government
aid
there
is
help
available
for
those
in
need
it
s
important
to
take
advantage
of
these
resources
to
help
make
college
a
viable
option
for
everyone
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
working
alone
in
an
english
class
is
that
it
allows
you
to
focus
without
interruption
or
distractions
when
you
work
by
yourself
you
can
easily
keep
track
of
your
progress
and
goals
due
to
lack
of
external
influence
additionally
you
can
take
risks
without
worrying
about
the
opinion
of
others
or
embarrassing
yourself
in
front
of
a
group
on
the
other
hand
group
work
has
its
own
distinct
advantages
working
in
a
group
provides
an
opportunity
to
learn
from
one
another
and
debate
different
ideas
through
collaboration
you
can
expand
your
knowledge
by
learning
from
and
challenging
each
other
s
perspectives
additionally
group
work
can
be
beneficial
in
creating
a
sense
of
ownership
and
accountability
that
can
be
motivating
to
all
working
in
a
group
or
working
alone
both
have
equivalent
advantages
and
the
best
choice
should
be
based
on
individual
needs
both
methods
of
work
can
be
used
to
develop
the
skills
required
to
complete
an
english
class
having
enforced
curfews
for
teenagers
in
many
american
cities
it
is
time
that
our
city
council
adopted
this
practice
in
order
to
ensure
the
safety
and
wellbeing
of
our
youth
teenagers
are
at
an
impressionable
age
and
with
the
amount
of
peer
pressure
and
outside
influence
they
face
providing
them
with
structure
and
discipline
in
the
form
of
a
curfew
is
essential
in
keeping
them
on
the
right
track
and
making
our
streets
safer
a
curfew
could
help
reduce
the
amount
of
delinquent
behavior
amongst
teenagers
and
encourage
them
to
participate
in
positive
activities
such
as
study
exercise
or
sports
has
shown
that
teenage
crime
rates
and
unsafe
behavior
tend
to
increase
during
the
late
evening
hours
and
having
a
curfew
in
place
would
limit
the
amount
of
time
they
have
available
to
get
involved
in
risky
behavior
in
addition
implementing
a
nighttime
curfew
may
also
present
an
effective
way
of
curbing
underage
drinking
and
other
associated
issues
a
nighttime
curfew
could
potentially
reduce
the
amount
of
distractions
for
young
people
allowing
them
more
focused
time
to
concentrate
on
their
studies
and
plan
for
their
future
in
today
s
fast paced
world
young
people
are
over exposed
to
a
wide
variety
of
influences
and
responsibilities
and
having
a
curfew
allows
them
to
get
a
better
balance
of
rest
and
recreation
all
these
factors
make
it
clear
that
adopting
a
curfew
for
teenagers
is
necessary
for
our
city
council
to
promote
the
safe
and
responsible
development
of
the
youth
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
personal
development
is
the
development
of
character
traits
a
person
s
character
traits
are
the
combination
of
characteristics
and
qualities
that
define
an
individual
both
good
and
bad
traits
are
shaped
by
a
variety
of
factors
including
environment
upbringing
and
personal
experiences
it
is
important
for
individuals
to
be
aware
of
why
these
traits
are
important
and
how
they
can
help
or
hinder
their
progress
in
life
when
discussing
the
development
of
character
traits
it
is
important
to
consider
some
examples
of
people
who
have
achieved
extraordinary
results
and
how
their
character
traits
have
helped
them
along
the
way
improving
our
own
character
traits
also
requires
a
certain
level
of
discipline
and
commitment
to
the
process
furthermore
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
differences
between
adults
and
children
in
how
they
approach
and
execute
this
same
task
of
developing
these
traits
finally
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
the
consequences
associated
with
developing
certain
character
traits
and
the
impact

can
have
on
one
s
life

a
situation
people
with
a

actively
work
towards
it

an
extremely
beneficial
effect
on
their
overall
mental
health

focused
motivated
and
maintaining
a
healthy
outlook
individuals
can
effectively
navigate
their
life
challenges
while
keeping
their
mental
health
in
check
attending
regular
classes
can
have
many
advantages
over
solely
attending
online
classes
particularly
when
it
comes
to
learning
from
other
cultures
gaining
confidence
in
interactions
with
people
and
getting
involved
in
activities
through
taking
regular
classes
students
can
have
the
opportunity
to
interact
with
other
students
and
professors
from
a
variety
of
cultures
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
learn
and
build
their
understanding
of
different
people
and
their
respective
cultures
furthermore
regular
classes
have
an
emphasis
on
student
participation
and
engagement
which
can
help
to
build
a
confident
attitude
when
it
comes
to
both
public
speaking
and
working
with
peers
on
tasks
helping
students
to
become
more
confident
in
their
interpersonal
skills
finally
with
regular
classes
there
are
more
opportunities
for
extracurricular
activities
that
can
help
to
build
connections
with
other
students
as
well
as
valuable
skills
such
as
creative
thinking
teamwork
and
leadership
i
find
the
quote
unless
you
try
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
to
be
highly
applicable
to
my
own
life
there
have
been
several
times
when
i
have
challenged
my
own
abilities
and
surpassed
my
self imposed
limitations
and
the
result
of
that
has
been
my
growth
and
development
as
a
person
to
give
an
example
when
i
was
younger
i
was
terrified
of
public
speaking
after
much
practice
i
was
eventually
able
to
present
a
speech
in
front
of
an
audience
without
fear
or
hesitation
this
experience
allowed
me
to
grow
in
confidence
and
pushed
me
out
of
my
comfort
zone
however
not
everyone
adheres
to
this
quote
and
the
consequences
of
this
can
be
costly
for
instance
if
someone
does
not
try
to
challenge
their
current
abilities
they
can
become
stagnant
and
risk
not
reaching
their
full
potential
ultimately
it
s
important
to
constantly
push
oneself
to
strive
for
more
and
to
never
be
satisfied
with
what
you
already
know
making
good
decisions
is
essential
for
personal
growth
when
faced
with
choices
it
is
important
to
actively
research
the
consequences
of
making
the
wrong
decision
before
rushing
into
any
conclusions
it
is
also
crucial
to
consider
how
our
decisions
might
affect
the
people
around
us
seeking
guidance
from
an
expert
can
be
beneficial
in
order
to
gain
insight
and
perspective
on
the
various
potential
outcomes
of
our
decisions
additionally
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
take
time
to
appreciate
life
because
we
never
know
what
the
future
might
hold
by
understanding
our
decisions
and
their
potential
consequences
we
can
make
more
meaningful
and
wise
choices
that
impact
both
ourselves
and
our
loved
ones
in
a
positive
way
technology
has
revolutionised
our
lives
in
more
ways
than
we
could
possibly
imagine
it
has
brought
significant
advantages
to
our
everyday
lives
allowing
us
to
stay
connected
do
our
work
faster
and
smarter
and
access
information
with
amazing
speed
and
accuracy
however
there
is
potential
for
misuse
when
it
comes
to
technology
for
example
technology
can
be
used
to
access
personal
data
manipulate
financial
systems
and
enable
online
scams
and
frauds
at
the
same
time
technology
can
have
potential
negative
effects
on
the
new
generation
with
the
emergence
of
social
media
and
internet
addiction
children
can
be
exposed
to
unhealthy
and
unsafe
online
content
potentially
affecting
their
mental
and
physical
health
in
addition
technology
has
disrupted
traditional
business
operations
redefining
the
way
business
works
and
operates
companies
are
able
to
create
more
efficient
processes
and
operations
resulting
in
cost
and
time
savings
consequently
companies
are
able
to
expand
into
new
markets
drive
innovation
and
create
new
opportunities
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
the
world
would
be
like
without
technology
with
its
ever changing
developments
technology
is
continuously
transforming
the
world
and
providing
us
with
new
ways
of
connecting
working
and
engaging
with
each
other
soccer
is
one
of
the
oldest
sports
in
the
world
with
a
rich
and
vibrant
history
its
roots
extend
back
to
ancient
where
it
was
played
in
the
form
of
the
ball game
over
the
centuries
soccer
has
become
a
popular
sport
in
many
cultures
and
it
has
been
embraced
as
a
way
to
promote
physical
education
with
its
emphasis
on
teamwork
speed
and
skill
soccer
is
a
great
way
to
build
skills

soccer
helps
to
increase
physical
fitness

agility
and
promotes
self confidence

teaches
skills
like
cooperation
communication
and
discipline
which
can
be
useful
in
the
classroom
it
also
encourages
creativity
and
problem solving
abilities
physical
education
not
only
helps
to
build
physical
abilities
but
it
can
also
lead
to
enjoyment
participating
in
physical
activities
creates
a
more
relaxed
atmosphere
taking
the
mind
off
of
the
pressures
of
schoolwork
it
can
be
an
escape
that
can
help
students
to
focus
and
recharge
although
soccer
and
physical
education
share
many
similarities
there
are
also
differences
in
the
way
they
work
follows
more
specific
rules
and
regulations
than
physical
education
making
it
more
competitive
and
fast paced
conversely
physical
education
often
focuses
more
on
individual
efforts
and
creative
endeavours
providing
a
comfortable
environment
for
students
to
express
themselves
and
have
fun
overall
soccer
and
physical
education
both
have
great
value
in
terms
of
providing
physical
and
mental
benefits
they
can
help
to
develop
useful
skills
foster
enjoyment
and
provide
a
much
needed
break
from
school
work
when
considering
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
older
and
younger
students
interacting
with
each
other
the
potential
for
such
an
experience
to
be
beneficial
is
immense
programs
such
as
intergenerational
activities
and
peers
mentoring
systems
can
be
useful
in
developing
relationships
among
students

these
activities
older
students
can
help
to
teach
and
guide
younger
students
in
various
aspects
including
but
not
limited
to
academics
sports
are
often
an
overlooked
component

physical
health
benefits
associated
with
sport
student
also
gain
an
understanding
of

through
sports
younger
students
are
able
to
learn
these
qualities
from
their
older
peers
and
mutually
build
relationships
as
such
it
is
clear
that
sports
hold
an
important
role
in
a
program
promoting
interactions
between
these
two
generations
cellphones
have
become
an
increasing
part
of
everyday
life
and
classrooms
are
no
exception
schools
are
beginning
to
embrace
this
technology
for
its
potential
to
encourage
learning
and
more
personalized
instruction
not
only
are
schools
allowing
students
to
bring
mobile
devices
to
use
during
class
but
certain
apps
have
been
developed
to
enhance
teaching
and
improve
student
results
while
there
are
potential
issues
that
come
with
allowing
cellphones
in
the
classroom
if
done
properly
they
can
be
an
invaluable
learning
tool
as
such
schools
must
establish
established
guidelines
for
acceptable
use
as
well
as
safety
measures
such
as
time
and
data
restrictions
in
addition
cellphones
can
be
used
in
the
case
of
family
emergencies
such
as
when
a
student
needs
to
leave
school
early
or
attend
an
appointment
furthermore
schools
can
provide
information
on
how
to
contact
the
school
in
emergencies
as
well
as
ways
parents
can
be
informed
should
emergency
arise

a
sense
of
purpose

closer
to
achieving
their
dreams
establishing
a
midnight
curfew
for
teenagers
can
provide
invaluable
benefits
in
terms
of
responsibility
maturity
and
safety
having
a
curfew
in
place
is
an
effective
and
important
tool
for
parents
to
use
to
guide
their
teenagers
and
help
ensure
they
stay
safe
and
make
responsible
decisions
it
also
allows
teens
to
become
independent
think
for
themselves
and
face
consequences
related
to
their
actions
all
key
elements
for
maturing
into
responsible
adults
the
curfew
encourages
adolescents
to
plan
ahead
and
be
mindful
of
how
they
spend
their
time
as
they
must
be
home
by
a
certain
hour
additionally
by
providing
an
inherent
sense
of
structure
and
accountability
the
curfew
sets
limits
for
teens
and
limits
the
amount
of
time
they
can
take
part
in
activities
that
can
be
harmful
or
illegal
this
ensures
that
teenagers
are
home
at
a
reasonable
time
enabling
their
parents
to
spend
time
with
them
and
ensure
their
safety
until
morning
ultimately
establishing
a
midnight
curfew
for
teenagers
is
an
effective
measure
for
cultivating
responsibility
maturity
and
safety
there
is
no
denying
that
having
rules
and
expectations
in
place
helps
parents
guide
their
teenagers
toward
becoming
independent
responsible
adults
in
our
ever changing
world
the
idea
that
success
comes
from
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
has
often
been
a
point
of
discussion
among
academics
and
laypeople
alike
the
argument
has
been
posed
that
a
great
achievement
can
only
come
from
surviving
each
failure
and
striving
for
greater
heights
proponents
of
this
belief
often
cite
examples
such
as
and
his
famous
quote
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
wo
n t
work
on
the
flip
side
there
is
a
view
that
failure
should
be
taken
as
an
opportunity
to
reassess
and
reframe
rather
than
as
an
opportunity
to
strive
to
reach
the
same
goal
this
perspective
tends
to
suggest
that
if
we
fail
we
should
take
as
much
of
the
experience
as
we
can
and
redirect
our
future
objectives
and
ambitions
accordingly
the
answer
to
this
question
can
not
be
definitively
answered
as
it
is
a
subjective
experience
for
some
success
may
come
from
repeatedly
working
on
the
same
goal
with
enthusiasm
and
re evaluating
outcomes
of
previous
failures
for
others
it
may
come
from
accepting
the
fact
that
failure
is
a
part
of
life
and
having
the
courage
to
move
on
and
make
a
course
correction
ultimately
no
one
can
say
what
brings
about
success
it
is
a
unique
journey
that
is
relative
to
the
individual
and
the
circumstances
they
face
in
conclusion
success
is
a
multifaceted
concept
and
whether
failure
can
lead
to
it
depends
on
the
context
the
idea
that
success
comes
from
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
is
an
intriguing
one
and
it
may
be
beneficial
for
those
working
hard
to
reach
their
goals
to
keep
in
mind
however
taking
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
reflect
and
re direct
your
goals
may
also
be
a
useful
strategy
in
achieving
the
ultimate
goal
of
success
living
a
life
of
honesty
is
key
in
being
respected
trusted
and
having
healthy
relationships
with
those
around
us
honest
people
are
seen
as
dependable
to
their
friends
and
family
and
allow
them
to
have
trust
in
their
words
and
actions
through
different
situations
involving
honesty
it
is
important
to
be
discernible
when
and
how
we
communicate
our
thoughts
and
opinions
when
i
do
n t
like
someone
i
m
not
always
inclined
to
tell
them
directly
how
i
feel
instead
i
try
to
be
civil
and
polite
and
provide
an
honest
but
diplomatic
answer
when
asked
for
my
opinions
this
allows
me
to
separate
my
personal
feelings
from
the
situation
and
maintain
respect
for
that
person
one
time
in
particular
i
was
having
problems
with
a
coworker
i
did
n t
get
along
with
despite
our
disagreements
i
treated
him
with
respect
always
seeking
to
find
a
common
ground
for
our
working
relationship
this
fostered
a
more
positive
work
environment
despite
our
differences
and
helped
others
to
trust
in
my
honesty
in
contrast
when
i
have
done
something
wrong
i
do
n t
hesitate
to
take
ownership
and
apologize
for
my
mistakes
is
also
a
key
part
of
this
because
it
fosters
an
environment
where
mistakes
are
acknowledged
and
gives
others
the
incentive
to
do
the
same
for
example
when
i
was
younger
i
made
some
poor
decisions
that
i
was
n t
proud
of
but
i
always
owned
up
to
them
rather
than
trying
to
hide
my
actions
this
gave
me
the
chance
to
apologize
and
make
amends
with
those
that
i
had
wronged
as
well
as
taught
me
the
importance
of
honesty
in
my
life
finally
when
it
comes
to
arguments
i
believe
that
being
honest
is
the
most
important
factor
even
in
disagreements
it
s
important
to
share
your
opinion
honestly
but
to
also
remain
respectful
stay
open
to
what
the
other
person
has
to
say
and
work
towards
a
resolution
i
experienced
this
firsthand
in
an
argument
with
a
family
member
at
the
time
i
was
feeling
frustrated
and
wanted
to
win
the
argument
but
then
i
realized
that
if
i
was
honest
and
civil
it
would
not
only
benefit
me
in
the
long
run
but
would
also
help
the
other
person
understand
my
point
of

to

all
i
believe
that
honesty
is
an
essential
part
of
living
a
good
life
and
making
meaningful
connections
with
others
by
being
honest
in
different
situations

and
understanding
advancements
in
technology
have
revolutionized
the
way
that
societies
interact
and
can
be
considered
a
double edged
sword
on
one
hand
technology
has
done
wonders
to
bridge
the
gap
between
different
cultures
and
facilitate
cross border
economic
transactions
yet
technology
can
also
create
limitations
in
human
contact
consequently
it
is
necessary
to
evaluate
the
positive
and
negative
effects
of
such
restrictions
on
physical
and
mental
health
social
relationships
and
economics
in
terms
of
physical
health
technology induced
limits
to
human
contact
may
lead
to
a
decrease
in
physical
exercise
and
consequently
in
overall
fitness
conversely
virtual
connections
may
promote
healthier
relationships
since
users
can
virtually
communicate
with
peers
thus
reducing
physical
danger
associated
with
face to face
interactions
when
it
comes
to
mental
health
technology
limits
on
human
contact
can
have
both
a
negative
and
positive
influence
on
one
hand
too
much
reliance
on
technology
can
result
in
feelings
of
isolation
and
loneliness
yet
virtual
conversations
may
also
provide
an
emotional
outlet
and
promote
engagement
with
others
lastly
social
relationships
are
affected
in
both
positive
and
negative
ways
by
technological
restrictions
on
human
contact
for
instance
virtual
communication
can
facilitate
social
support
yet
can
also
replace
many
meaningful
interactions
that
would
typically
occur
in person
thereby
diminishing
human
connection
alongside
this
technological
advancements
are
also
altering
economic
transactions
as
an
increasing
number
of
businesses
are
turning
to
online
platforms
to
better
communicate
with
their
customers
in
conclusion
technological
limitations
on
human
contact
may
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
physical
and
mental
health
social
relationships
and
economic
effects
consequently
careful
consideration
and
evaluation
must
be
taken
in

to
maximize

one
of
the

provide
a
stunning

a

to
one
of
the
many
bustling
japanese

is
a
must
from
the

wide
range
of
items
from

can

find

the

a
real
glimpse
of
the

the
recent
uptick
in
public
discourse
around
homeschooling
has
generated
questions
about
how
to
maximize
the
educational
opportunities
of
home schoolers
one
possible
solution
is
to
take
advantage
of
the
increasing
availability
of
online
courses
courses
provide
home schoolers
with
access
to
a
wide
range
of
educational
topics
and
resources
taking
classes
online
from
home
has
several
advantages
such
as
providing
a
low cost
learning
option
additionally
there
is
more
freedom
to
tailor
a
learning
strategy
to
individual
preferences
however
there
are
also
disadvantages
to
take
into
consideration
home schoolers
must
be
aware
of
the
lack
of
social
interaction
that
online
courses
often
provide
moreover
online
courses
require
more
self discipline
and
time
management
than
traditional
classes
before
pursuing
online
classes
from
home
it
is
important
to
evaluate
both
the
cost
and
benefit
of
this
approach
by
researching
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
taking
classes
online
from
home
along
with
different
learning
strategies
that
could
benefit
home schoolers
one
can
make
an
informed
decision
as
to
the
best
way
to
maximize
the
educational
opportunities
for
their
home schoolers
making
a
good
first
impression
is
important
as
it
can
shape
how
we
are
seen
and
treated
by
those
around
us
having
a
positive
first
impression
can
go
a
long
way
in
establishing
trust
and
rapport
with
others
while
having
a
negative
first
impression
can
lead
to
suspicion
and
unease
for
example
when
i
first
started
working
at
my
new
job
i
made
sure
to
smile
and
shake
my
manager
s
hand
firmly
to
give
a
friendly
impression
we
ended
up
working
together
for
many
years
and
built
a
solid
relationship
of
trust
and
understanding
having
patience
when
meeting
someone
for
the
first
time
is
also
key
i
once
had
a
negative
first
impression
of
a
colleague
due
to
a
misunderstanding
but
as
i
got
to
know
them
better
and
became
more
patient
i
found
that
i
actually
liked
and
respected
them
this
teaches
us
the
importance
of
understanding
and
taking
the
time
to
develop
relationships
with
others
in
order
to
see
past
first
impressions
when
it
comes
to
electives
the
debate
is
divided
between
those
who
see
them
as
a
vital
part
of
academic
and
personal
growth
and
those
who
view
them
as
a
mere
distraction
from
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
on
one
hand
electives
expose
students
to
a
variety
of
subjects
allowing
them
to
gain
valuable
skills
and
knowledge
outside
of
their
chosen
major
additionally
students
can
use
electives
to
explore
their
interests
helping
them
to
determine
their
future
career
path
on
the
other
hand
some
students
find
the
range
of
elective
offerings
to
be
too
limited
or
uninteresting
leading
them
to
question
why
they
even
need
to
attend
school
at
all
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
elective
classes
one
must
consider
the
academic
and
career
opportunities
available
to
students
for
example
research
has
shown
that
taking
an
elective
course
in
business
can
lead
to
better
outcomes
for
students
in
finance related
careers
additionally
taking
an
elective
can
help
students
to
improve
their
academic
performance
by
increasing
their
engagement
with
the
material
ultimately
it
is
incumbent
upon
educators
to
offer
elective
classes
that
are
interesting
and
relevant
to
students
in
order
to
ensure
that
every
student
has
the
opportunity
to
explore
the
subjects
that
interest
them

today
cell
phones
have
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
with
their
ever increasing
capabilities
cell
phones
have
become
an
extension
of
our
everyday
life
as
educators
and
parents
it
is
important
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
school
hours
has
shown
that
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
in
school
may
bring
numerous
benefits
phones
can
provide
students
with
valuable
educational
resources
allowing
them
access
to
educational
materials
right
at
their
fingertips
in
addition
cell
phones
can
be
used
for
emergency
situations
providing
students
with
a
tool
to
quickly
contact
an
administrator
in
case
of
an
emergency
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
concerning
disadvantages
to
allowing
cell
phones
in
school
cell
phones
in
school
could
lead
to
distractions
and
decreases
in
student
focus
there
is
also
the
potential
for
cyberbullying
through
text
messages
or
social
media
posts
therefore
when
it
comes
to
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
during
school
hours
careful
consideration
should
be
taken
we
must
weigh
the
potential
risks
with
the
potential
educational
benefits
of
cell
phones
in
order
to
properly
assess
its
use
in
the
classroom
it
is
my
belief
that
an
appropriate
cell
phone
usage
policy
should
be
implemented
providing
necessary
guidance
and
regulation
for
students
to
use
cell
phones
in
an
appropriate
and
educational
manner
first
impressions
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
how
we
interact
with
people
and
form
our
opinions
of
them
however
the
power
of
first
impressions
should
not
be
overestimated
as
our
opinion
of
a
person
may
change
over
time
as
we
get
to
know
them
better
take
for
example
the
case
of
a
student
who
had
a
poor
first
impression
of
a
teacher
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
student
saw
the
teacher
as
unapproachable
and
strict
however
as
the
school
year
progressed
the
student
got
to
know
the
teacher
and
learned
that
he
was
actually
kind
and
accommodating
of
their
individual
needs
in
order
to
build
a
positive
rapport
with
others
it
s
important
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
give
people
a
chance
to
show
their
true
colors
this
means
being
understanding
and
respectful
of
others
regardless
of
first
impressions
communication
is
key
being
mindful
of
one
s
body
language
and
tone
can
ensure
that
initial
interactions
go
smoothly
do
n t
make
assumptions
about
someone
s
character
based
on
fleeting
impressions
instead
take
the
time
to
get
to
know
them
and
come
to
your
own
conclusion
for
many
students
attending
classes
from
home
can
be
an
ineffective
way
to
learn
being
in
the
classroom
provides
an
environment
tailored
to
learning
which
offers
a
level
of
structure
and
motivation
that
is
often
absent
when
studying
from
home
without
the
presence
of
a
teacher
to
guide
them
students
can
be
easily
distracted
have
difficulty
staying
focused
or
lose
sight
of
their
goals
furthermore
online
classes
may
not
provide
the
same
level
of
interaction
and
support
that
would
be
available
in
a
physical
classroom
making
it
difficult
for
students
to
get
answers
to
their
questions
or
feedback
on
their
progress
the
lack
of
personal
engagement
may
limit
a
student
s
ability
to
comprehend
material
hamper
their
ability
to
learn
complex
concepts
and
hinder
their
overall
academic
success
playing
professional
soccer
has
been
something
i
ve
loved
doing
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
since
then
i
ve
been
working
to
improve
my
skill
and
i
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
it
to
become
a
professional
soccer
player
you
need
to
have
the
right
mindset
it
requires
passion
dedication
and
hard
work
i
feel
playing
professional
soccer
gives
me
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment
and
pride
i
m
constantly
looking
to
push
myself
and
get
better
and
i
love
the
challenge
soccer
has
also
provided
me
with
the
chance
to
travel
the
world
and
meet
new
people
being
able
to
experience
the
different
cultures
has
been
incredible
and
i
m
thankful
for
the
opportunities
it
has
presented
at
the
end
of
the
day
playing
professional
soccer
is
something
i
m
passionate
about
and
something
i
love
to
do
the
fact
that
i
can
compete
at
the
highest
level
and
be
challenged
every
day
keeps
me
motivated
to
do
better
and
get
better
there
is
no
feeling
like
it
the
legendary
entrepreneur
and
philanthropist
acquired
his
staggering
wealth
through
a
diligent
application
of
hard
work
an
unrelenting
passion
for
scaling
technology
and
an
innate
ability
to
capitalize
on
business
opportunities
he
devoted
himself
to
strengthening
his
empire
which
is
notorious
for
quickly
adapting
to
changing
trends
in
modern
technology
effective
and
ambitious
business
strategy
forever
changed
the
states
and
ultimately
that
of
the
world
the
longstanding
debate
about
whether
wealth
is
attained
solely
through
genetic
opportunities
or
through
hard
work
and
dedication
has
generated
much
contention
it
is
generally
accepted
that
individuals
can
acquire
wealth
through
perseverance
and
determination
rather
than
relying
solely
on
their
genetic
predispositions
those
who
function
with
the
mindset
that
money
should
be
pursued
through
hard
work
are
more
likely
to
be
successful
in
attaining
and
maintaining
wealth
the
notion
that
wealth
is
a
result
of
self improvement
and
labor
not
sheer
luck
prevails
in
today
s
society
clubs
provide
invaluable
assistance
to
students
teachers
and
the
school district
as
a
whole
by
providing
an
environment
dedicated
to
completing
homework
tasks
students
can
benefit
from
the
focused
attention
and
guidance
of
qualified
volunteers
during
after school
hours
with
extra
support
students
will
be
better
equipped
to
understand
difficult
concepts
and
assignments
and
can
benefit
from
the
improved
personal
and
academic
self confidence
they
gain
teachers
too
often
find
that
students
with
a
better
comprehension
of
core
subject
material
perform
better
on
assessments
in
terms
of
resources
and
support
required
to
implement
a
homework
club
schools districts
must
provide
volunteers
space
and
supplies
volunteers
are
usually
community
members
who
offer
their
time
to
students
free
of
charge
and
thus
relieve
schools districts
of
financial
burden
additionally
any
materials
purchased
for
the
club
should
be
kept
to
a
minimum
though
the
associated
costs
are
minimal
the
impact
on
student
learning
outcomes
is
invaluable
in
fact
studies
have
indicated
that
the
presence
of
homework
clubs
can
lead
to
more
successful
academic
performance
and
increased
student
engagement
and
retention
ultimately
homework
clubs
have
the
potential
to
be
an
incredibly
positive
addition
to
a
school district
providing
students
with
a
focused
and
supportive
environment
in
which
to
complete
their
homework
can
be
immensely
beneficial
both
academically
and
emotionally
as
such
a
thorough
and
thoughtful
evaluation
of
the
costs
and
benefits
associated
with
the
establishment
of
a
homework
club
should
be
considered
the
subject
of
students
committing
to
a
career
in
their
early
years
has
been
a
point
of
contention
among
scholars
and
the
general
public
for
some
time
on
the
one
hand
there
are
those
who
advocate
for
students
deciding
their
future
early
because
of
the
various
benefits
this
can
bring
such
as
a
clearer
sense
of
direction
and
the
ability
to
take
advantage
of
specialized
programs
and
classes
on
the
other
hand
some
argue
that
the
idea
of
choosing
a
career
too
early
may
be
too
much
of
a
constraint
on
one
s
educational
and
career
choices
and
can
even
be
detrimental
leading
to
immobility
and
dissatisfaction
when
evaluating
this
prompt
it
is
important
to
consider
the
various
social
economic
and
personal
factors
influencing
a
student
s
decision
for
example
in
certain
economic
or
social
contexts
the
pressure
to
choose
a
career
early
in
life
may
be
even
more
pronounced
additionally
if
a
student
feels
they
do
not
have
sufficient
support
resources
or
guidance
when
deciding
their
future
they
may
opt
to
choose
a
career
without
sufficient
thought
moreover
personal
motivations
and
choices
also
play
an
important
role
in
a
student
s
decision making
process
if
a
student
has
a
strong
passion
for
a
particular
profession
they
may
choose
it
despite
the
challenges
it
entails
while
another
may
be
swayed
by
other
considerations
such
as
future
income
or
job
security
the
decision
to
commit
to
a
career
during
one
s
early
years
is
a
complex
one
that
could
have
far reaching
implications
for
the
student
s
future
therefore
it
is
important
that
students
take
the
time
to
research
the
field
they
are
interested
in
and
be
aware
of
their
own
motivations
and
constraints
before
making
a
decision
the
states
is
currently
facing
a
variety
of
social
and
economic
issues
including
high
levels
of
income
inequality
inadequate
healthcare
policies
and
unaffordable
housing
costs
these
crises
and
their
far reaching
consequences
are
impacting
the
everyday
lives
of
average
americans
from
increasing
educational
costs
to
the
lack
of
job
security
and
opportunities
americans
must
make
difficult
choices
just
to
get
by
the
government
has
a
critical
responsibility
in
helping
to
mitigate
the
worst
effects
of
these
issues
and
make
a
fairer
and
more
equitable
society
unfortunately
it
does
not
always
carry
out
that
responsibility
working
hard
is
essential
for
the
individual
s
success
but
it
can
also
have
a
collective
impact
on
the
american
economy
work
opportunities
are
varied
and
come
with
different
rewards
high skilled
labor
offers
higher
wages
but
often
requires
significant
investments
of
time
and
money
low wage
work
offers
fewer
benefits
and
has
a
less
stable
job
outlook
path
is
taken
the
outcome
will
be
reverberating
throughout
the
economy
to
further
support
the
government
in
protecting
citizens
we
must
become
more
active
and
involved
in
our
communities
everyone
has
a
role
to
play
whether
it
is
organizing
or
advocating
volunteering
or
donating
it
takes
collective
effort
to
bring
about
meaningful
change
that
will
help
improve
the
lives
of
everyone
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
success
in

positive
helps
a
person
stay
motivated
gives
them
the
courage
to
take
risks
and
leads
them
to
greater
opportunities
with
a
positive
attitude
a
person
can
realize
their
ambitions
and
go
farther
than
with
a
negative
one
having
a
positive
outlook
also
helps
a
person
to
maintain
an
optimistic
and
resilient
frame
of
mind
when
facing
obstacles
by
contrast
those
with
a
negative
attitude
will
often
get
stuck
in
a
cycle
of
pessimism
and
negative mindedness
resulting
in
stagnation
and
lack
of
progress
in
short
having
a
positive
attitude
is
integral
to
achieving
success
in
life
it
helps
a
person
to
remain
optimistic
and
resilient
while
facing
obstacles
and
rewards
them
with
greater
opportunities
and
potential
for
growth
with
a
positive
attitude
everyone
has
the
potential
to
achieve
incredible
things
the
advent
of
technology
has
greatly
changed
our
lives
both
positively
and
negatively
when
it
comes
to
contact
between
people
on
the
one
hand
technology
has
enabled
us
to
connect
with
people
more
quickly
and
efficiently
than
ever
before
we
can
call
text
and
video
chat
with
people
virtually
anywhere
in
the
world
without
ever
having
to
leave
our
homes
we
can
also
network
and
collaborate
with
people
online
allowing
us
to
form
meaningful
relationships
from
thousands
of
miles
away
on
the
other
hand
the
convenience
of
technology
has
led
to
a
decline
in
face to face
contact
with
the
rise
of
social
media
it
s
become
even
easier
to
stay
in
touch
but
actual
physical
contact
is
becoming
less
common
despite
its
many
benefits
technology
can
also
lead
to
isolation
and
loneliness
if
it
is
overused
people
can
spend
hours
glued
to
their
phones
and
computers
never
leaving
the
house
and
rarely
interacting
with
anyone
in
person
this
can
lead
to
increased
feelings
of
isolation
depression
and
anxiety
in
conclusion
while
technology
has
had
a
positive
effect
on
human
contact
by
making
connectivity
between
people
much
easier
its
overuse
can
also
lead
to
negative
effects
on
people
s
lives
when
used
in
moderation
technology
can
be
a
valuable
tool
but
when
taken
to
extremes
it
can
lead
to
feelings
of
loneliness
and
disconnection
the
potential
for
negative
effects
outweighs
the
positive
ones
so
it
is
important
to
make
sure
to
use
technology
in
a
balanced
and
responsible
manner
many
people
agree
that
pushing
yourself
to
do
something
outside
of
your
comfort
zone
is
an
important
aspect
of
growth
and
development
taking
on
challenges
that
are
unfamiliar
or
difficult
can
help
a
person
gain
experiences
and
knowledge
allowing
them
to
progress
and
develop
as
an
individual
it
can
be
hard
to
step
out
of
our
comfort
zones
but
it
can
also
be
incredibly
rewarding
on
the
other
hand
some
people
disagree
with
this
statement
they
believe
that
tailoring
our
endeavors
to
our
existing
skills
and
abilities
can
also
lead
to
growth
through
practice
and
refinement
of
what
we
have
mastered
we
can
become
highly
skilled
in
that
area
pursuing
interests
within
our
comfort
zone
can
also
lead
to
success
and
could
even
lead
to
areas
of
growth
or
learning
that
were
not
previously
considered
my
opinion
is
that
i
generally
agree
with
the
statement
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
while
every
situation
is
different
and
can
be
approached
in
various
ways
i
think
there
is
a
great
opportunity
to
be
seized
when
one
pushes
themselves
to
do
something
that
initially
seems
difficult
taking
on
a
challenge
can
help
us
gain
knowledge
and
experiences
that
can
be
used
to
foster
further
growth
and
can
also
introduce
us
to
interesting
new
ideas
and
opportunities
extending
the
hours
of
school
and
working
hours
per
day
may
seem
like
a
daunting
task
but
it
is
important
to
investigate
the
potential
pros
and
cons
of
this
proposed
change
on
the
one
hand
lengthening
students
school
days
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
academic
performance
and
better
time
management
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
potential
for
burnout
among
students
and
teachers
as
well
as
a
heightened
risk
of
stress related
illness
and
mental
health
issues
due
to
extended
periods
of
learning
and
working
it
is
also
important
to
compare
and
contrast
the
consequences
of
working
four
days
a
week
versus
hours
a
day
working
four
days
a
week
would
allow
students
and
teachers
a
longer
weekend
to
rest
and
recover
but
more
time
in
school
each
day
could
lead
to
better
absorption
of
the
material
and
increased
academic
performance
on
the
other
hand
working
hours
a
day
could
shorten
the
workweek
and
lead
to
greater
workplace
efficiency
however
it
could
also
lead
to
a
weaker
quality
of
work
due
to
fatigue
and
the
potential
for
burnout
working
more
than
hours
a
day
has
its
own
drawbacks
including
a
heightened
risk
of
fatigue
stress
and
depression
even
with
an
extended
number
of
hours
employers
and
educators
should
consider
alternative
methods
of
breaking
up
the
day
such
as
flexible
working
hours
breaks
or
reduced
working
hours
per
week
finally
it
is
important
to
explore
the
underlying
reasons
why
teachers
and
students
might
be
pursuing
this
model
some
might
argue
the
longer
hours
provide
more
opportunities
for
learning
while
others
might
believe
the
extended
hours
provide
additional
time
for
project
work
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
both
perspectives
when
making
decisions
about
school
and
working
hours
technology
is
impacting
the
way
we
interact
with
other
people
in
our
everyday
lives
with
the
ability
to
purchase
items
online
watch
movies
and
shows
online
talk
to
friends
through
text
messages
and
rather
than
face to face
conversations
it
is
safe
to
say
that
technology
limits
our
contact
with
other
people
as
a
result
of
this
the
quality
of
our
communication
suffers
and
people
become
lazy
take
for
example
the
orders
made
online
rather
than
customers
going
into
stores
it
is
more
convenient
to
have
items
delivered
to
the
door
but
it
is
also
limiting
human
contact
with
other
people
shopping
online
eliminates
the
human
touch
of
conversation
that
would
have
taken
place
between
store
clerks
and
the
buyers
as
well
as
the
sense
of
community
in
the
store
that
customers
feel
additionally
when
people
communicate
through
online
media
such
as
text
messages
and
it
is
hard
to
convey
emotions
because
there
is
no
facial
expression
or
voice
tone
to
reflect
those
feelings
this
leads
to
frustration
and
a
lack
of
understanding
in
conversations
to
reduce
the
negative
effects
of
technology
it
is
important
for
people
to
take
regular
breaks
and
engage
in
activities
that
require
human
contact
such
as
going
to
a
café
with
friends
one
should
embrace
technology
but
also
make
sure
to
limit
its
use
in
order
to
build
personal
relationships
social
media
should
also
be
used
carefully
any
meaningful
relationships
formed
online
should
not
replace
face to face
conversations
in
order
to
keep
people
connected
to
the
world
around
them
technology
can
be
a
helpful
tool
but
humans
must
not
allow
it
to
limit
their
contact
with
other
people
one
of
the
ways
in
which
important
people
can
influence
those
who
are
less
important
is
through
setting
an
example
and
exhibiting
desirable
behavior
for
instance
led
the
indian
independence
movement
and
is
widely
revered
as
one
of
the
most
influential
figures
of
our
time
his
leadership
profoundly
influenced
the
lives
of
millions
and
he
set
an
exemplary
example
of
peaceful
protest
and
civil
disobedience
which
has
inspired
countless
others
similarly
organized
nonviolent
marches
to
combat
segregation
and
racial
discrimination
and
his
actions
resulted
in
tangible
progress
toward
civil
rights
reforms
this
kind
of
example
and
behavior
is
the
strongest
form
of
influence
people
can
have it
is
not
just
lip
service
or
words
but
an
actual
demonstration
that
inspires
others
to
follow
it
can
foster
mutual
respect
among
different
classes
and
it
exemplifies
how
important
people
should
use
their
power
to
bring
about
positive
change
this
is
the
best
way
to
influence
those
who
are
less
important
as
examples
and
behavior
ultimately
lead
to
tangible
and
lasting
results
attending
classes
in
person
vs
from
home
using
online video
resources
has
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
one
advantage
of
attending
classes
in
person
is
that
the
student
can
engage
in
hands on
activities
can
build
relationships
with
their
peers
and
can
receive
one on one
help
from
the
teacher
on
the
other
hand
attending
classes
remotely
has
its
own
advantages
it
allows
students
to
listen
to
videos
slideshows
and
tutorials
on
their
own
time
can
give
students
more
flexibility
with
their
time
and
schedule
and
can
save
money
by
eliminating
the
need
to
travel
to
a
physical
classroom
both
of
these
options
have
their
pros
and
cons
and
it
s
up
to
the
student
to
decide
which
one
is
best
for
them
working
together
in
a
group
can
bring
several
benefits
including
increased
productivity
faster
problem solving
and
the
ability
to
tackle
larger
projects
thanks
to
the
power
of
collaboration
a
team
of
people
working
together
can
often
accomplish
more
than
the
same
number
of
people
working
independently
for
instance
a
small
group
of
people
tasked
with
cleaning
up
a
park
might
be
able
to
finish
the
job
much
more
quickly
if
each
person
takes
on
a
different
corner
than
if
they
all
clean
the
same
area
with
problem solving
too
a
group
setting
can
result
in
a
quicker
solution
than
working
alone
if
a
team
of
five
people
each
put
their
heads
together
with
the
goal
of
finding
the
most
efficient
route
for
a
delivery
chances
are
they
will
come
up
with
a
better
solution
than
one
individual
working
on
it
finally
working
together
in
a
group
opens
the
door
to
tackling
larger
more
complex
projects
than
any
one
person
could
do
on
their
own
from
a
collaborative
art
piece
to
a
complicated
engineering
project
forming
a
group
increases
the
likelihood
of
success
studies
have
shown
that
teamwork
can
be
beneficial
for
students
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
working
in
a
group
or
team
provides
more
opportunities
to
think
critically
develop
problem solving
skills
and
become
aware
of
different
perspectives
collaboration
in
the
classroom
can
also
help
to
create
a
more
engaging
and
enjoyable
learning
experience
in
addition
studies
have
found
that
working
in
teams
can
improve
a
student
s
self esteem
and
foster
a
sense
of
belonging
while
reducing
feelings
of
isolation
and
loneliness
working
with
a
group
can
also
help
students
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
material
they
are
studying
as
well
as
generate
new
ideas
for
projects
and
assignments
while
working
as
a
group
may
not
always
be
the
most
efficient
way
to
complete
a
task
the
benefits
that
can
be
gained
from
the
experience
often
outweigh
the
drawbacks
is
an
essential
part
of
growing
up
throughout
history
educators
have
sought
to
equip
students
with
the
skills
knowledge
and
values
necessary
to
take
part
in
society
the
idea
of
allowing
students
to
be
responsible
for
their
own
education
with
minimal
oversight
by
teachers
is
an
intriguing
concept
to
explore
on
one
hand
such
a
system
could
allow
students
to
take
greater
control
of
their
own
learning
experience
diversify
their
curriculum
to
more
accurately
match
their
individual
interests
and
encourage
them
to
develop
self discipline
as
they
manage
their
own
progress
students
may
find
this
approach
more
stimulating
and
exciting
than
a
traditional
education
leading
to
better
engagement
and
improved
academic
achievement
on
the
other
hand
without
appropriate
oversight
students
may
lack
guidance
and
support
when
they
encounter
difficult
topics
or
have
difficulty
learning
independently
they
may
end
up
focusing
solely
on
topics
that
interest
them
leaving
gaps
in
their
knowledge
in
addition
self directed
learning
can
be
difficult
to
sustain
and
lack
of
structure
and
accountability
could
demotivate
students
and
lead
to
less
successful
outcomes
allowing
students
to
be
responsible
for
their
own
education
is
a
complex
idea
with
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
educators
must
consider
the
type
of
structure
and
resources
required
to
provide
appropriate
support
and
guidance
for
self directed
students
while
not
stifling
their
creativity
and
enthusiasm
for
learning
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
setting
a
good
example
can
have
a
positive
influence
on
those
around
us
he
demonstrated
great
courage
and
dedication
to
his
beliefs
by
leading
non violent
protests
that
changed
the
course
of
history
his
example
of
peaceful
protests
was
an
instrumental
factor
in
civil
rights
progress
just
as
he
showed
leadership
by
setting
a
positive
example
we
can
follow
his
lead
by
demonstrating
good
conduct
in
the
various
aspects
of
our
lives
i
have
personally
experienced
the
power
of
setting
a
good
example
in
my
own
life
last
year
i
chose
to
become
a
mentor
for
a
group
of
elementary
school
children
in
my
community
as
i
got
to
know
each
child
i
realized
that
my
example
was
having
a
profound
influence
on
them
from
their
attitude
and
behavior
to
their
academic
performance
my
role
as
a
mentor
was
to
provide
a
positive
foundation
and
set
the
right
path
so
that
the
children
could
better
understand
the
power
of
making
smart
decisions
overall
setting
a
good
example
is
an
important
way
for
us
to
have
a
lasting
and
meaningful
impact
on
the
people
around
us
it
takes
courage
dedication
and
commitment
to
be
that
guiding
force
for
others
but
by
following
the
legacy
of
we
can
all
be
part
of
a
generation
of
positive
change makers
when
you
take
the
time
to
develop
your
own
special
talents
or
qualities
you
unlock
an
incredible
part
of
who
you
are
and
the
benefits
it
can
bring
to
your
life
are
endless
i
know
this
firsthand
from
my
own
experiences
growing
up
i
did
n t
initially
find
success
in
school
but
when
i
was
given
the
chance
to
take
a
computer
codding
course
i
blossomed
having
the
confidence
to
finally
be
able
to
excel
and
be
good
at
something
gave
my
self esteem
a
real
boost
which
i
am
still
feeling
the
effects
from
today
the
same
rings
true
for
someone
i
know
my
husband
has
always
been
a
keen
artist
he
s
had
a
passion
for
sketching
and
painting
since
he
was
a
little
boy
after
years
of
practice
he
is
now
a
successful
illustrator
selling
his
art
via
his
online
portfolio
it
s
been
amazing
to
witness
how
believing
in
himself
and
taking
the
time
to
build
on
his
creativity
over
these
past
few
years
has
improved
not
only
his
skill
set
and
income
but
his
overall
quality
of
life
as
he
now
gets
to
follow
his
dreams
every
day
having
gratitude
for
your
own
abilities
and
having
the
motivation
to
work
on
them
can
have
a
hugely
positive
effect
for
anyone
by
proactively
working
on
developing
your
own
individual
strengths
you
not
only
unlock
a
better
vision
for
yourself
but
for
your
potential
of
achieving
significant
goals
as
i
ve
looked
closely
at
my
current
talents
and
skills
i
noticed
something
that
really
resonates
with
me
i
m
passionate
about
playing
music
i
ve
decided
that
i
will
use
my
free
time
to
explore
this
passion
by
learning
and
developing
my
musical
skills
and
abilities
in
order
to
do
this
i
will
focus
on
researching
and
studying
the
fundamentals
of
music
theory
and
honing
my
craft
by
taking
the
time
to
learn
how
to
play
a
chosen
instrument
and
practicing
regularly
i
will
be
sure
to
also
take
the
time
to
refine
and
perfect
my
skill
as
i
continue
to
practice
in
the
hopes
of
eventually
mastering
the
skill
through
this
process
i
will
continue
to
learn
and
grow
as
a
musician
and
am
excited
to
see
where
this
journey
of
self development
will
take
me

false
praise
and

are
powerful
tools
for
educators
as
they
can
instantly
boost
a
student
s
self esteem
and
encourage
them
to
work
harder

these
tools
must
be
used
carefully
and
judiciously
as
not
all
students
may
respond
positively
to
false
praise
or
hope
false
praise
for
example
can
create
false
expectations
which
can
lead
to
disappointment
and
feelings
of
inadequacy
or
shame
similarly
with
hope
it
is
important
to
provide
only
realistic
and
achievable
goals
rather
than
trying
to
set
unrealistic
expectations
the
best
way
to
build
and
maintain
self esteem
is
to
promote
a
sense
of
deep
intrinsic
motivation
in
the

is
achievable
by
focusing
not
just
on
the
outcome
but
on
the
process
of
learning
and
striving
for
something
worthwhile
this
way
accomplishments
and
successes
become
less
about
achieving
a
goal
and
more
about
propelling
the
student
to
learn
something
new
and
develop
skills
and
knowledge
at
the
same
time
by
nurturing
the
student
s
sense
of
worth
and
ability
to
overcome
setbacks
educators
can
help
build
a
strong
foundation
for
self esteem
in

to
explore
new
possibilities
that

doors
to
better
career
options
allowing

to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
whenever
possible
in

more
successful
outcomes

of
the
most
important
benefits
of
adding
healthier
food
options
in
school
cafeterias
is
improved
overall
health
eating
a
nutritious
and
balanced
diet
is
essential
for
a
developing
body
and
mind
and
incorporating
healthier
options
into
meal
plans
ensures
that
students
are
receiving
the
nutrients
they
need
also
shows
that
making
healthier
options
available
increases
the
likelihood
that
students
will
make
better
eating
choices
additionally
providing
healthy
selections
can
help
combat
issues
like
childhood
obesity
and
chronic
illnesses
another
advantage
of
adding
healthier
food
items
to
school
cafeterias
is
that
it
teaches
students
the
importance
of
making
good
nutrition
choices
instilling
healthy
habits
in
younger
generations
can
lead
to
better
health
outcomes
later
in
life
by
exposing
students
to
a
variety
of
nutritious
options
it
can
make
healthy
eating
seem
less
overwhelming
and
more
achievable
finally
including
more
health
options
can
also
be
an
affordable
way
for
schools
to
improve
overall
student
wellbeing
introducing
cheaper
healthier
items
such
as
fruits
and
vegetables
can
have
positive
impacts
on
students
health
without
significantly
increasing
costs
in
conclusion
changing
the
cafeteria
menu
to
include
more
healthy
food
options
is
an
incredibly
beneficial
decision
for
schools
and
students
alike
not
only
does
it
improve
students
health
it
also
teaches
them
the
importance
of
good
nutrition
and
can
even
be
a
cost effective
initiative
many
students
enter
their
high
school
career
without
a
clear
vision
of
their
future
path
this
often
leads
to
confusion
and
anxiety
when
trying
to
decide
which
academic
or
extracurricular
activities
to
pursue
while
some
students
may
feel
pressure
to
have
already
identified
a
career
before
beginning
their
high
school
journey
it
is
not
always
necessary
although
some
students
may
benefit
from
already
having
an
idea
of
the
field
they
wish
to
pursue
others
may
explore
a
variety
of
subjects
during
their
high
school
years
and
decide
upon
a
career
later
this
could
be
beneficial
since
high
school
classes
provide
an
introduction
to
a
wide
array
of
topics
from
which
students
can
develop
a
better
understanding
of
potential
career
fields
by
engaging
in
hands on
experiences
and
taking
classes
in
related
subjects
students
can
gain
a
deeper
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
a
chosen
field
therefore
identifying
a
career
in
high
school
is
not
essential
as
there
are
other
options
available
on
the
other
hand
identifying
a
career
before
beginning
high
school
can
provide
a
student
with
direction
when
choosing
classes
and
extracurricular
activities
having
a
clear
idea
of
the
path
they
wish
to
take
can
serve
as
a
motivator
for
students
allowing
them
to
stay
focused
on
their
goals
and
strive
for
success
knowing
which
classes
to
take
and
which
extracurricular
activities
to
participate
in
can
give
students
an
edge
when
applying
for
college
or
the
job
market
overall
there
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
both
approaches
or
not
students
should
identify
a
career
by
the
time
they
enter
high
school
comes
down
to
personal
preference
it
should
be
a
decision
based
on

circumstances
and
goals
ultimately

sincerely
break
is
a
much anticipated
respite
from
the
stresses
of
school
in
recent
years
summer
breaks
have
been
trending
shorter
leaving
students
with
less
time
to
relax
or
take
advantage
of
travel
opportunities
for
many
international
students
summer
breaks
have
become
especially
short
with
limited
time
off
from
school
they
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
visit
family
or
explore
their
own
cultures
this
can
have
a
major
impact
on
student
satisfaction
and
preparedness
for
the
school
year
despite
potential
challenges
a
shorter
summer
break
can
still
provide
some
benefits
it
gives
students
the
time
to
learn
about
different
cultures
and
gain
knowledge
from
historical
sites
as
well
as
hone
their
skills
in
areas
such
as
language
and
cultural
fluency
however
the
negative
effect
of
a
shorter
summer
break
can
not
be
ignored
students
may
not
have
enough
time
to
travel
or
visit
family
resulting
in
more
stress
and
limited
opportunities
to
form
meaningful
connections
ultimately
it
is
essential
to
investigate
the
opportunities
and
drawbacks
of
shorter
summer
breaks
in
order
to
explore
the
best
ways
of
preparing
students
for
the
school
year
ultimately
a
balance
needs
to
be
struck
in
order
to
ensure
both
academic
and
personal
success
i
recently
faced
a
problem
when
coordinating
a
large scale
event
at
work
we
had
initially
set
a
budget
far
too
low
and
as
tasks
began
to
pile
up
it
became
clear
that
the
event
could
not
be
completed
within
the
established
budget
i
had
to
act
quickly
and
make
some
tough
decisions
i
ended
up
decreasing
expenses
in
some
nonessential
areas
and
negotiating
with
vendors
for
better
deals
we
were
able
to
have
the
event
run
within
the
set
budget
after
all
looking
back
i
now
realize
i
should
have
done
a
better
job
assessing
the
cost
of
the
event
from
the
start
i
had
underestimated
certain
costs
such
as
vendor
fees
and
failed
to
see
the
bigger
picture
going
forward
i
ll
make
sure
to
do
a
thorough
review
of
the
budget
every
time
so
that
no
surprises
arise
most
importantly
i
learned
not
to
be
afraid
of
making
difficult
decisions
and
that
with
the
right
strategy
problems
can
be
solved
technology
has
been
incorporated
into
our
daily
lives
and
has
changed
how
we
live
work
communicate
and
interact
it
has
had
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
people
s
lives
one
of
the
most
positive
effects
of
technology
is
improved
communication
we
are
now
able
to
connect
with
people
all
over
the
world
with
technologies
such
as
email
text
messaging
video
calls
and
social
media
we
are
also
able
to
work
remotely
from
home
which
has
increased
our
levels
of
productivity
and
connected
us
to
job
opportunities
that
may
not
have
previously
been
available
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
some
negative
effects
associated
with
technology
increased
screen
time
can
lead
to
physical
inactivity
poor
sleep
quality
eye
strain
and
obesity
in
addition
the
proliferation
of
online
trolling
and
cyberbullying
has
caused
many
people
to
feel
unsafe
online
leading
to
potential
mental
health
concerns
such
as
anxiety
and
depression
as
with
any
technology
there
are
both
positive
and
negative
aspects
of
incorporating
it
into
our
daily
lives
ultimately
it
is
up
to
us
to
use
technology
responsibly
and
ensure
that
it
is
having
a
positive
effect
on
our
lives
technology
has
the
potential
to
make
a
tremendous
positive
impact
on
people
s
lives
in
a
variety
of
ways
for
example
mobile
health
technology
can
enable
doctors
to
provide
remote
care
and
advice
to
people
even
from
a
distance
health
devices
such
as
wearable
technology
can
allow
doctors
to
monitor
patient
activity
and
receive
real time
data
on
patient
health
which
can
provide
valuable
insight
into
the
patient
s
overall
health
status
additionally
telehealth
programs
can
provide
people
with
routine
care
and
diagnoses
to
manage
chronic
conditions
by
utilizing
these
tools
people
can
have
access
to
quality
health
care
even
if
they
ca
n t
visit
a
doctor
in
person
another
way
that
technology
can
improve
people
s
lives
is
through
improved
accessibility
assistive
technologies
such
as
voice
recognition
software
can
enable
people
with
physical
limitations
to
communicate
more
efficiently
while
computer aided
reading
programs
can
provide
an
opportunity
to
gain
knowledge
without
the
need
to
physically
visit
a
library
this
technology
can
create
a
stronger
sense
of
physical
and
social
freedom
for
people
with
disabilities
that
would
otherwise
be
unable
to
receive
an
education
or
work
in
many
industries
finally
communication
technology
can
help
create
connections
with
family
friends
and
strangers
around
the
world
regardless
of
physical
distance
through
social
media
people
can
communicate
and
share
experiences
without
the
need
to
physically
meet
someone
additionally
communication
technology
can
benefit
people
in
emergency
situations
and
provide
better
medical
response
times
for
instance
through
connected
medical
devices
people
can
receive
tailored
medical
care
including
remote
health
monitoring
and
early
diagnosis
of
health
concerns
in
conclusion
technology
has
the
potential
to
significantly
improve
people
s
lives
in
numerous
ways
including
through
improved
remote
health
care
better
accessibility
for
people
with
disabilities
and
stronger
connections
with
individuals
from
around
the
world
by
exploring
all
of
the
ways
technology
can
make
a
positive
difference
people
can
better
understand
the
current
and
potential
future
benefits
of
advances
in
technology
when
trying
to
come
up
with
a
convincing
argument
providing
more
than
one
example
is
a
strategy
that
can
be
used
this
technique
has
been
proven
to
effectively
increase
a
person
s
understanding
of
the
matter
presented
to
them
by
providing
multiple
examples
the
persuasiveness
of
an
argument
is
increased
and
the
evidence
is
strengthened
it
also
keeps
the
listener
engaged
and
their
attention
is
held
one
study
suggests
that
providing
two
examples
is

policy
and
have
many
similarities
such
as
both
focusing
on
improving
the
healthcare
system
however
there
are
also
some
key
differences
between
them
policy
focuses
on
providing
access
to
quality
healthcare
by
mandating
that
all
citizens
have
health
insurance
while
focuses
on
providing
incentives
to
doctors
to
increase
the
number
of
people
they
treat
in
my
opinion
is
more
beneficial
in
terms
of
reducing
healthcare
costs
and
increasing
access
to
medical
services
by
requiring
all
citizens
to
purchase
health
insurance
the
cost
of
healthcare
can
be
spread
out
and
made
more
affordable
additionally
by
mandating
health
insurance
more
people
would
be
able
to
access
the
healthcare
they
need
on
the
other
hand
is
beneficial
in
terms
of
reducing
the
cost
of
healthcare
services
by
providing
incentives
to
doctors
more
people
would
be
able
to
receive
medical
treatment
and
would
be
able
to
find
a
doctor
more
quickly
this
would
help
reduce
wait
times
and
reduce
the
amount
of
money
spent
on
medical
costs
overall
i
think
both
policies
have
their
merits
and
can
be
used
in
tandem
to
improve
the
healthcare
system
by
providing
incentives
to
doctors
and
requiring
all
citizens
to
purchase
health
insurance
both
policies
can
work
together
to
make
healthcare
more
accessible
and
more
affordable
my

is
to
become
a

engineer
and
make

the
importance
of

may
choose

a

can
provide
invaluable

help

i
understand
that
it

important

myself
some
of
the
most
successful
people
do

just
rely

an

team
to
achieve

they
learn
to
trust
in

and
make

based
on

understanding
taking
time
to
relax
and
reflect
helps
me
gain
valuable

that
is
required
when

it

overall
giving
myself
the
time
to
trust
in

in

reach
my
goal
is
a
valued
trait
that
can
carry
many
benefits
and
consequences
depending
on
the
situation
being
honest
with
friends
and
family
in
particular
is
especially
important
as
trust
and
openness
are
essential
components
of
these
relationships
although
it
may
be
difficult
to
be
honest
about
certain
issues
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
benefits
of
doing
so
transparency
and
honest
communication
can
help
strengthen
connections
and
promote
a
sense
of
understanding
among
friends
and
family
members
on
the
other
hand
it
is
important
to
note
that
being
too
honest
in
certain
situations
can
lead
to
hurt
feelings
and
damaged
relationships
ultimately
the
importance
of
being
open
and
honest
in
relationships
should
be
weighed
against
potential
risks
if
the
rewards
of
honesty
outweigh
the
drawbacks
then
honesty
may
be
the
best
choice
excerpt
students
who
work
hard
and
strive
to
make
the
best
decisions
possible
should
be
rewarded
for
their
efforts
supporting
students
who
strive
to
achieve
and
accomplish
goals
by
allowing
them
to
play
sports
or
participate
in
activities
if
they
have
a
average
or
higher
is
a
great
way
to
motivate
them
this
will
also
encourage
students
to
take
their
studies
more
seriously
and
become
more
involved
in
school
by
doing
so
they
will
begin
to
realize
the
importance
of
trying
hard
and
making
good
decisions
this
will
help
to
develop
their
social
and
leadership
skills
as
well
as
their
academic
knowledge
furthermore
it
will
teach
them
the
value
of
hard
work
and
dedication
and
that
it
can
help
them
reach
their
goals
upon
researching
stores
located
both
in
and
it
became
evident
that
both
of
these
stores
have
had
long standing
connections
with
esteemed
italian
fashion
house
stores
have
risen
in
value
and
resell
potential
in
recent
years
fostering
a
sense
of
social
inclusion
and
exclusivity
for
those
interested
in
starting
their
own
organization
much
of
s
success
has
been
attributed
to
its
creatively inclined
collaboration
efforts
and
willingness
to
take
risks
to
the
potential
employee
working
at
provides
a
sense
of
creativity
accomplishment
and
collaboration
that
can
extend
beyond
the
conventional
retail
job
a
day
at
is
typically
marked
by
friendly
service
engaging
conversations
with
customers
and
productivity driven
tasks
some
of
the
prospective
benefits
one
can
expect
from
working
in
a
store
include
on the job
learning
experiences
ample
job
flexibility
and
cutting edge
knowledge
about
s
products
and
collaborations
when
it
comes
to
achieving
our
goals
there
are
two
paths
we
can
take
actively
working
towards
our
goals
or
simply
sitting
and
waiting
to
see
what
happens
as
noted
i
m
a
great
believer
in
luck
and
i
find
the
harder
i
work
the
more
i
have
of
it
his
quote
highlights
the
idea
that
hard
work
and
determination
can
lead
to
success
which
is
the
ultimate
benefit
of
taking
the
active
approach
on
the
other
hand
adopting
a
wait
and
see
strategy
can
also
be
a
valid
approach
as
the
ancient
proverb
says
is
when
preparation
meets
opportunity
while
it
is
possible
to
reap
the
rewards
of
good
fortune
being
prepared
beforehand
will
increase
the
chances
that
success
will
come
when
the
right
opportunity
arises
ultimately
both
paths
have
their
advantages
by
actively
pursuing
our
goals
we
may
gain
valuable
skills
and
experiences
on
the
other
hand
waiting
can
lead
to
surprise
successes
and
offer
more
flexibility
in
our
approach
thus
it
is
up
to
each
individual
to
decide
which
approach
to
take
when
it
comes
to
deciding
on
a
college
course
or
career
path
the
process
can
seem
daunting
that
s
why
it
is
important
to
research
the
differences
between
university
and
college
courses
for
different
career
fields
and
make
a
list
of
college
courses
available
for
various
career
fields
creating
a
timeline
is
also
a
helpful
way
to
plan
out
your
next
steps
and
identify
potential
career
options
that
are
best
for
you
do
n t
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
talking
to
students
who
have
already
made
decisions
on
college
courses
or
career
paths
can
be
a
great
way
to
learn
from
their
experiences
it
is
also
important
to
investigate
the
resources
available
to
students
to
help
them
during
this
process
with
the
right
resources
and
a
clear
plan
you
will
be
well
prepared
to
pursue
your
college
course
or
career
path
studying
the
cultures
laws
religions
and
languages
of
different
countries
around
the
world
can
open
our
eyes
to
the
incredible
diversity
of
humanity
and
sharing
experiences
with
others
presents
incredible
opportunities
to
better
understand
and
empathize
with
one
another
by
sharing
our
wisdom
we
can
prevent
our
friends
and
family
from
making
catastrophic
mistakes
i
remember
a
time
when
my
uncle
shared
his
experiences
during
a
particularly
dangerous
situation
his
wise
advice
stopped
me
from
making
a
potentially
hazardous
decision
that
day
and
i
am
eternally
grateful
to
him
for
his
guidance
sharing
our
experiences
and
wisdom
can
benefit
our
lives
and
future
immensely
teaching
us
to
be
more
cautious
and
fostering
understanding
and
compassion
among
different
groups
over
time
people
s
first
impressions
of
someone
can
change
for
a
variety
of
reasons
one
of
the
most
common
is
simply
getting
to
know
someone
better
getting
to
know
someone
beyond
their
appearance
and
surface
level
traits
can
cause
a
drastic
shift
in
opinion
in
addition
even
the
smallest
of
changes
in
behavior
or
attitude
can
sway
a
person
to
have
a
different
first
impression
as
a
person
continues
to
interact
with
the
individual
their
perception
and
attitude
about
that
person
can
change
as
a
result
of
new
experiences
or
conversations
by
interacting
with
the
individual
more
a
person
can
form
a
better
understanding
of
the
individual
this
could
lead
to
a
far
different
view
of
the
individual
from
the
initial
first
impression
as
this
understanding
develops
any
preconceived
notions
or
biases
about
the
individual
can
fade
away
creating
an
entirely
different
opinion
than
the
one
initially
formed
in
conclusion
first
impressions
of
someone
can
evolve
and
differ
from
the
initial
one
formed
over
time
factors
such
as
getting
to
know
someone
better
and
forming
a
better
understanding
of
them
can
lead
to
differences
in
opinion
therefore
it
is
important
to
not
rush
to
judgement
in
forming
these
first
impressions
and
be
patient
in
forming
a
better
understanding
of
someone
the
invention
of
the
telephone
changed
the
world
forever
ushering
in
a
new
era
of
communication
in
the
late
inventor
debuted
the
prototype
for
the
first
practical
telephone
allowing
individuals
to
transmit
their
voice
through
a
system
of
wires
thus
began
the
journey
of
what
would
become
the
ubiquitous
device
that
powers
long distance
conversations
today
the
progression
of
the
telephone
over
the
past
century
or
so
has
been
astounding
advances
in
digital
and
networking
technology
have
allowed
for
smaller
more
powerful
phones
to
be
developed
as
well
as
the
incorporation
of
sophisticated
features
such
as
voicemail
texting
and
phone
apps
this
has
enabled
users
to
stay
connected
with
one
another
no
matter
where
they
are
in
the
world
on
one
side
the
telephone
has
had
a
largely
positive
effect
on
communication
and
relationships
people
can
now
stay
in
contact
over
long
distances
be
a
part
of
global
conversations
and
keep
up
with
the
news
from
around
the
world
on
the
other
hand
it
has
also
had
some
negative
impacts
has
resulted
in
an
overwhelming
amount
of
media
consumption
leading
to
an
increase
in
stress
and
anxiety
among
users
it
has
also
resulted
in
decreased
attention
spans
and
information
overload
which
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
focus
overall
the
invention
of
the
telephone
and
its
progression
over
the
years
has
brought
about
both
positive
and
negatives
impacts
on
society
while
its
ability
to
keep
people
connected
is
undeniably
valuable
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
the
negative
effects
of
technology
that
it
can
create
and
take
the
necessary
steps
to
mitigate
them
excerpt
history
failure
has
often
been
the
precursor
to
success
and
is
famously
quoted
for
remarking
that
success
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
simple
quotation
succinctly
illustrates
an
important
truth
failure
should
not
be
feared
but
embraced
it
is
difficult
to
succeed
without
first
having
failed
to
better
understand
this
concept
it
is
important
to
consider
two
main
reasons
why
failure
can
lead
to
success
failure
can
often
provide
valuable
insight
and
guidance
in
our
lives
the
knowledge
that
one
gains
through
failing
can
help
them
to
better
equip
themselves
for
future
success
for
example
famously
remarked
that
failure
taught
him
a
thousand
ways
not
to
build
a
lightbulb
this
perspective
allowed
him
to
look
at
each
instance
of
failure
as
a
lesson
rather
than
an
impediment
to
success
another
example
of
this
notion
is
when
failed
a
major
quiz
in
high
school
originally
considering
it
a
disappointment
remarked
later
that
it
was
the
best
thing
as
it
changed
her
attitude
towards
learning
and
inspired
her
to
take
courses
she
was
genuinely
passionate
about
failure
can
provide
an
emotional
sense
of
resilience
that
is
necessary
for
success
those
that
can
effectively
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
use
their
failures
as
a
source
of
motivation
can
become
more
resilient
as
an
example
of
this
was
famously
cut
from
his
high
school
basketball
team
but
through
hard
work
and
dedication
he
became
one
of
the
greatest
basketball
players
of
all
time
another
case
in
point
is
who
got
several
rejections
in
her
attempt
to
find
a
publisher
for
her
now
renowned
book
however
she
persevered
and
eventually
found
someone
who
believed
in
her
story
and
was
willing
to
take
a
chance
all
in
all
failure
is
a
concept
that
should
not
be
feared
but
seen
as
an
important
stepping
stone
to
achieving
ultimate
success
it
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
helping
us
to
develop
qualities
such
as
resilience
in
order
to
reach
our
goals
thus
it
is
important
to
remember
s
words
that
success
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
we
have
long
known
that
exposure
to
the
arts
has
a
significant
positive
impact
on
people
s
development
and
overall
wellbeing
they
can
help
students
become
more
creative
and
develop
problem
solving
skills
as
well
as
find
their
voice
and
better
express
themselves
furthermore
the
curriculum
of
an
arts
class
teaches
students
to
appreciate
different
cultures
and
perspectives
therefore
i
believe
that
students
should
be
required
to
take
an
arts
class
in
order
to
graduate
this
requirement
would
open
students
to
new
ideas
and
experiences
help
them
to
grow
as
individuals
and
develop
an
appreciation
for
the
creative
world
around
them
forcing
students
to
take
an
arts
class
would
not
only
benefit
them
as
they
graduate
into
society
but
would
also
ultimately
benefit
the
society
they
enter
as
a
whole
human
beings
are
fundamentally
shaped
by
the
family
and
community
that
surrounds
them
from
the
moment
we
are
born
until
the
day
we
die
our
thoughts
perspectives
and
values
are
shaped
by
those
closest
to
us
people
tend
to
view
themselves
in
comparison
to
those
around
them
emulating
certain
behavior
and
attitudes
based
on
the
societies
they
live
in
consequently
it
can
be
difficult
for
individuals
to
separate
themselves
from
these
influences
and
form
an
identity
of
their
own
no
matter
how
hard
one
tries
to
find
their
own
voice
the
societal
pressure
to
conform
still
remains
ultimately
family
and
community
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
development
of
character
traits
success
in
school
requires
dedication
and
organization
begin
by
creating
a
detailed
schedule
of
when
assignments
are
due
and
set
aside
specific
times
for
studying
then
make
sure
to
follow
through
with
this
schedule
everyday
to
make
sure
everything
is
completed
and
turned
in
on
time
break
large
tasks
into
smaller
achievable
goals
and
make
a
plan
for
when
each
of
these
smaller
goals
should
be
completed
additionally
be
respectful
to
teachers
and
ask
questions
when
you
are
unsure
making
sure
to
prioritize
school
and
taking
full
advantage
of
teachers
resources
provides
a
strong
foundation
for
a
successful
academic
experience
is
a
value
that
everyone
should
strive
to
live
up
to
as
it
has
far reaching
effects
in
nearly
every
area
of
life
on
a
personal
level
honesty
can
help
us
to
be
true
to
ourselves
and
have
healthier
relationships
with
those
around
us
within
families
honesty
can
bring
everyone
closer
together
by
creating
a
safe
trusting
environment
in
all
of
our
interactions
with
people
outside
of
our
family
being
honest
fosters
good
communication
and
builds
stronger
relationships
i
ve
seen
the
advantages
of
being
honest
first
hand
in
high
school
i
was
open
and
honest
with
my
parents
about
my
extracurricular
activities
and
the
people
i
was
spending
my
time
with
this
often
led
to
us
having
meaningful
conversations
and
being
able
to
connect
on
a
deeper
level
even
though
i
was
growing
up
and
gaining
more
independence
i
also
found
that
by
being
honest
i
was
able
to
maintain
healthy
relationships
with
my
peers
and
adults
in
the
community
because
i
was
seen
as
reliable
and
trustworthy
ultimately
it
s
important
to
remember
that
honesty
is
more
than
just
the
absence
of
lying
it
encompasses
transparency
and
being
true
to
who
we
are
that
s
why
it
s
essential
to
prioritize
honesty
in
our
words
and
actions
as
it
can
create
stronger
connections
with
the
people
we
care
about
and
shape
us
as
individuals
having
a
positive
attitude
as
a
student
can
have
many
positive
benefits
a
positive
attitude
can
help
build
confidence
by
providing
a
sense
of
control
and
allowing
one
to
remain
optimistic
with
confidence
students
may
better
believe
in
their
ability
to
accomplish
their
goals
this
can
lead
to
improved
productivity
better
relationships
with
peers
and
teachers
and
better
grades
a
positive
attitude
may
also
lead
to
a
greater
respect
for
one
another
in
the
classroom
as
one
may
be
more
understanding
and
open
to
the
ideas
and
opinions
of
their
peers
all
in
all
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
a
powerful
impact
on
one
s
academic
success
is
an
important
life
skill
that
has
potential
implications
for
someone
s
future
making
decisions
independently
or
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
have
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
seeking
external
guidance
particularly
from
trusted
and
knowledgeable
sources
can
help
someone
become
better
informed
in
their
decision making
and
weigh
their
options
however
reliance
on
outside
help
can
also
lead
to
an
inability
to
make
decisions
independently
which
can
take
away
an
individual
s
autonomy
in
their
decision making
take
the
example
of
a
college
student
deciding
what
degree
to
pursue
if
the
student
solely
makes
the
decision
on
their
own
they
may
feel
more
in
control
and
the
process
more
authentic
however
depending
largely
on
their
own
knowledge
may
lead
them
to
miss
out
on
other
potential
options
or
choices
that
could
have
been
beneficial
to
their
future
alternatively
seeking
external
guidance
such
as
advisors
family
or
educational
programs
can
give
the
student
an
outside
perspective
and
information
not
available
to
them
individually
though
seeking
outside
help
can
potentially
lead
to
the
student
feeling
less
autonomy
and
sense
of
freedom
this
can
be
beneficial
to
their
future
decision making
as
they
will
be
more
informed
and
aware
of
the
process
ultimately
making
decisions
involves
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
independent
or
external
guidance
that
can
affect
the
individual
and
their
future
these
should
be
weighed
against
each
other
prior
to
reaching
a
decision
to
ensure
that
the
choice
made
is
the
best
option
for
the
individual
and
their
future
for
many
failure
and
enthusiasm
often
go
hand
in
hand
but
for
those
who
experience
failure
and
take
it
upon
themselves
to
turn
it
into
a
learning
experience
their
enthusiasm
is
often
rewarded
by
greater
success
in
the
end
it
s
not
always
easy
to
be
enthusiastically
optimistic
when
faced
with
challenge
and
failure
but
the
key
is
to
maintain
that
attitude
and
channel
it
into
your
efforts
to
move
forward
take
the
example
of
someone
who
has
faced
the
setback
of
failing
a
test
ultimately
their
enthusiasm
to
learn
and
grow
from
that
experience
is
what
will
propel
them
towards
greater
success
that
individual
could
stay
motivated
by
setting
goals
like
understanding
each
question
they
got
wrong
while
ensuring
their
enthusiasm
remains
purposeful
and
focused
with
an
enthusiasm
for
knowledge
hard
work
and
a
positive
attitude
they
will
eventually
be
able
to
successfully
pass
the
test
in
other
words
failure
can
be
used
as
a
learning
experience
to
drive
success
in
life
by
maintaining
a
positive
outlook
and
staying
motivated
to
work
hard
individuals
can
turn
failure
into
a
catalyst
for
growth
and
eventually
reach
levels
of
achievement
they
never
thought
possible
making
important
life
decisions
can
be
a
difficult
task
for
many
people
some
people
prefer
to
rely
on
their
own
judgment
and
make
these
decisions
independently
while
others
reach
out
to
experts
and
authorities
for
guidance
both
paths
can
have
their
merits
and
drawbacks
those
who
rely
on
their
own
independent
decisions
can
benefit
from
their
autonomy
and
sense
of
control
it
can
feel
empowering
to
make
decisions
without
being
influenced
by
others
and
ownership
over
one
s
choices
can
boost
motivation
and
increase
satisfaction
with
the
results
on
the
other
hand
relying
on
one
s
own
judgment
can
lead
to
tunnel
vision
meaning
one
could
miss
crucial
information
for
making
the
best
decision
those
who
seek
advice
from
experts
and
authorities
may
have
access
to
more
information
than
those
taking
the
independent
route
knowing
they
ve
researched
the
issue
from
multiple
angles
and
viewpoints
can
lead
to
a
more
informed
decision
with
greater
confidence
on
the
other
hand
relying
on
external
sources
can
lead
to
a
sense
of
lost
autonomy
and
inability
to
make
decisions
on
one
s
own
and
should
also
be
weighed
carefully
ultimately
it
s
important
to
consider
both
of
these
paths
when
determining
the
best
strategy
for
making
important
life
decisions
the
right
choice
for
an
individual
could
be
a
balance
of
relying
on
one
s
own
judgment
as
well
as
seeking
advice
from
outside
sources
an
elderly
philosopher
understood
s
saying
deeply
he
believed
that
it
was
important
to
aim
as
high
as
possible
in
life
and
to
strive
for
greatness
throughout
his
life
he
worked
tirelessly
to
be
the
best
he
could
be
and
the
result
of
his
hard
work
was
tremendous
success
he
devoted
himself
to
teaching
others
the
importance
of
reaching
for
the
stars
a
young
woman
in
her
early
twenties
saw
the
saying
in
a
completely
different
light
she
found
it
inspiring
but
also
intimidating
she
had
taken
a
job
at
a
local
business
as
a
receptionist
and
was
content
with
her
work
nevertheless
she
was
still
interested
in
growing
in
the
workplace
and
aiming
higher
in
her
career
she
was
slowly
making
progress
in
this
direction
and
as
a
result
gaining
greater
satisfaction
from
her
job
finally
was
a
middle aged
man
who
had
grown
complacent
over
the
years
he
mostly
worked
on
short term
tasks
and
was
reluctant
to
commit
to
long term
goals
he
did
just
enough
to
satisfy
his
needs
and
felt
that
it
was
better
to
be
safe
than
to
take
any
risks
he
viewed
s
saying
as
a
warning
and
felt
a
sense
of
caution
whenever
he
thought
of
improving
himself
all
three
individuals
had
different
perspectives
on
s
saying
and
each
had
found
a
way
to
apply
it
to
their
life
had
pursued
greatness
and
achieved
success
had
taken
one
step
at
a
time
to
aim
higher
and
had
actively
tried
to
avoid
setting
his
aim
too
high
to
ensure
safety
the
decision
of
how
many
extra curricular
activities
a
student
should
take
should
be
left
to
the
student
and
their
family
members
this
is
because
it
allows
the
student
and
their
family
members
to
make
the
best
decision
based
on
the
student
s
interests
and
abilities
by
exposing
students
to
a
variety
of
activities
outside
of
school
they
are
able
to
better
understand
their
passions
and
learn
new
skills
for
example
joining
a
robotics
club
can
teach
students
principles
of
engineering
and
help
them
develop
their
teamwork
and
problem solving
skills
it
also
gives
a
creative
outlet
for
those
students
who
may
prefer
to
explore
interests
outside
of
school
hours
similarly
joining
a
sports
team
at
school
can
provide
students
with
an
opportunity
to
learn
valuable
skills
such
as
leadership
collaboration
and
time
management
which
are
great
assets
in
today
s
competitive
job
market
on
the
other
hand
schools
worry
that
doing
too
many
extra activities
may
negatively
affect
a
student
s
studies
and
their
grades
by
spreading
themselves
too
thin
students
may
find
it
difficult
to
focus
and
devote
enough
time
to
certain
assignments
resulting
in
lower
academic
performance
additionally
when
a
student
is
too
involved
in
extracurricular
activities
they
may
become
overwhelmed
leading
to
increased
stress
levels
and
possibly
even
burnout
ultimately
the
decision
of
how
many
extra curricular
activities
a
student
should
take
should
be
left
to
the
student
and
their
family
members
by
providing
students
with
the
proper
guidance
and
support
they
can
learn
the
skills
and
values
needed
to
succeed
in
the
future
while
still
performing
well
in
school
as
technology
continues
to
evolve
cell
phones
and
digital
devices
have
been
integrated
into
the
classroom
more
than
ever
before
their
major
benefit
is
to
provide
students
with
a
range
of
tools
and
resources
to
help
them
understand
new
material
this
can
come
in
the
form
of
word
processing
apps
language
translations
and
other
software
that
can
explain
and
define
complex
words
and
terms
however
it
is
important
to
discuss
both
the
pros
and
cons
of
digital
device
use
in
the
classroom
while
students
have
more
opportunities
to
explore
concepts
there
can
be
issues
concerning
distraction
and
cheating
this
is
why
appropriate
parameters
must
be
established
so
students
use
the
technology
for
educational
purposes
only
technology
can
also
provide
numerous
benefits
for
students
depending
on
their
learning
needs
for
example
auditory
learners
could
use
devices
for
podcasts
and
other
audio
exercises
while
visual
learners
may
benefit
from
watching
videos
and
interacting
with
interactive
slides
teachers
can
also
create
activities
to
get
students
to
engage
with
their
phones
to
facilitate
discussion
and
debate
when
looking
at
how
cell
phones
and
other
digital
devices
are
used
in
the
classroom
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
issues
while
also
recognizing
their
potential
to
help
students
learn
it
is
important
to
consider
the
importance
of
trusting
your
own
decision
rather
than
always
relying
on
expert
advice
or
the
opinion
of
authorities
listening
to
professionals
can
provide
helpful
information
but
one
must
always
exercise
their
own
judgment
and
be
aware
of
their
own
feelings
and
thoughts
ignoring
your
intuition
and
making
the
wrong
decision
can
have
dire
consequences
ranging
from
missed
opportunities
to
poor
physical
or
mental
health
other
people
such
as
family
and
friends
can
provide
a
valuable
source
of
input
which
can
help
give
clarity
to
one
s
own
ideas
and
provide
insight
into
the
perspectives
of
other
people
when
making
decisions
it
is
important
to
weigh
up
both
one
s
own
opinion
against
that
of
family
and
other
sources
in
order
to
make
the
best
decision
above
all
it
is
essential
to
take
one
s
time
and
thoroughly
consider
the
decision
twice
before
taking
any
action
this
way
one
can
ensure
that
their
decision
is
well
informed
and
considered
distance
learning
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
students
across
the
world
who
find
themselves
unable
to
access
a
physical
school
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
distance
learning
is
that
it
offers
educational
opportunities
beyond
geographical
boundaries
and
students
of
any
age
have
access
to
extensive
resources
in
addition
from
a
student
s
perspective
distance
learning
has
proven
to
be
more
flexible
and
cheaper
students
can
develop
their
skills
independently
as
well
as
set
their
own
pace
it
is
also
useful
in
situations
where
a
student
may
have
a
disability
or
another
condition
that
makes
attending
a
physical
school
difficult
for
instance
a
case
study
of
a
student
in
the
revealed
the
immense
challenges
they
faced
due
to
distance
learning
they
faced
distractions
at
home
and
struggled
to
maintain
feelings
of
connection
and
motivation
without
the
help
of
teachers
or
peers
despite
its
advantages
there
are
also
potential
risks
associated
with
distance
learning
particularly
for
young
people
compared
to
a
physical
school
distance
learning
can
present
a
range
of
social
problems
and
may
negatively
affect
a
person
s
mental
wellbeing
if
they
find
themselves
too
isolated
or
do
not
have
adequate
support
in
conclusion
distance
learning
has
its
benefits
but
it
s
important
to
be
aware
of
potential
risks
especially
for
young
people
while
students
may
have
access
to
many
educational
resources
nothing
truly
replaces
the
valuable
experience
of
learning
growing
and
connecting
with
peers
in
a
physical
school
setting
good
morning
students
today
i
m
here
to
talk
to
you
about
the
importance
of
setting
and
achieving
goals
now
what
do
i
mean
when
i
talk
about
goals
well
this
could
be
something
like
getting
better
grades
finishing
a
project
on
time
or
even
making
a
new
friend
so
in
order
to
achieve
these
goals
it
s
important
to
have
some
motivation
this
could
be
something
like
having
positive
thoughts
or
asking
yourself
what
the
rewards
are
if
you
succeed
think
about
why
you
set
this
goal
and
why
it
s
important
for
you
finally
do
n t
give
up
once
you
set
your
goal
work
hard
to
achieve
it
and
do
n t
let
obstacles
stand
in
your
way
you
might
not
achieve
it
right
away
but
with
time
and
dedication
you
will
eventually
get
there
so
to
sum
it
up
when
it
comes
to
achieving
goals
just
remember
to
set
a
goal
stay
motivated
and
do
n t
give
up
over
the
last
two
decades
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
way
humans
interact
as
we
increasingly
rely
on
our
devices
and
the
internet
for
communication
and
entertainment
human
contact
and
the
way
in
which
we
build
meaningful
relationships
have
been
greatly
affected
one
of
the
main
consequences
of
our
overusage
of
technology
is
the
rise
of
bad
communication
skills
our
devices
allow
us
to
access
almost
the
entirety
of
the
world
s
knowledge
in
an
instant
but
all
too
many
people
find
themselves
lacking
in
emotional
intelligence
and
interpersonal
skills
without
regular
real
life
interactions
people
are
struggling
to
use
proper
manners
and
interact
with
one
another
in
a
meaningful
way
another
effect
is
the
potential
rise
in
health
problems
due
to
a
lack
of
physical
contact
and
inactivity
spending
more
time
on
our
devices
has
caused
people
to
prioritize
virtual
contact
over
physical
contact
thus
depriving
individuals
from
the
physical
and
mental
benefits
of
physical
contact
in
addition
people
are
also
playing
fewer
outdoor
activities
or
taking
leisurely
walks
which
decrease
physical
activity
and
leads
to
a
decrease
in
overall
health
and
wellbeing
finally
the
amount
of
time
people
are
spending
on
their
devices
has
led
to
people
living
in
an
increasingly
inactive
lifestyle
as
technology
has
allowed
us
to
access
our
work
study
and
entertainment
needs
from
the
comfort
of
our
homes
people
are
more
likely
to
stay
indoors
rather
than
go
outdoors
for
leisure
activities
or
stay
in
touch
with
their
respective
communities
overall
the
effects
of
technology
in
our
daily
lives
are
far
reaching
with
some
of
the
most
prominent
being
bad
communication
skills
health
problems
and
inactivity
it
is
important
that
we
remain
mindful
of
our
technology
consumption
and
ensure
that
it
does
not
become
an
unhealthy
lifestyle
creating
a
good
first
impression
is
essential
to
how
people
perceive
you
a
good
impression
can
create
a
lasting
positive
impression
that
can
affect
stances
on
issues
such
as
people
s
willingness
to
do
business
with
you
or
even
whether
they
will
associate
with
you
in
the
future
and
attitude
can
have
a
great
impact
on
how
people
judge
you
therefore
it
is
important
to
exhibit
a
positive
attitude
in
public
a
polite
attitude
and
good
manners
can
go
a
long
way
in
creating
a
positive
public
persona
taking
steps
such
as
dressing
appropriately
making
eye
contact
smiling
being
mindful
of
body
language
and
being
a
good
listener
when
others
are
speaking
can
help
create
a
positive
public
persona
all
of
these
steps
can
contribute
to
creating
a
good
impression
that
will
influence
people
s
perceptions
of
you
no
matter
what
our
aspirations
might
be
it
is
important
to
take
action
and
keep
moving
forward
taking
the
time
to
make
a
plan
and
determine
achievable
goals
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
ensure
success
but
it
s
just
as
important
to
stay
focused
and
continue
working
towards
those
goals
there
is
an
immense
amount
of
benefit
to
be
gained
by
always
doing
something
even
if
it
is
small
towards
our
goals
the
most
significant
benefit
is
that
it
reinforces
motivation
rather
than
wait
for
the
perfect
opportunity
or
motivation
taking
action
helps
keep
us
focussed
on
our
goals
when
we
start
making
headway
towards
these
goals
we
are
more
likely
to
keep
going
and
to
eventually
achieve
them
in
addition
always
doing
something
can
help
us
better
manage
our
time
taking
small
steps
towards
a
long
term
goal
can
help
us
break
the
task
down
into
more
manageable
chunks
this
makes
it
easier
to
plan
and
prevents
us
from
feeling
overwhelmed
it
also
means
that
we
can
track
our
progress
and
stay
on
top
of
deadlines
finally
it
is
important
to
remember
that
every
small
victory
can
be
seen
as
a
step
towards
success
taking
action
leads
to
opportunities
that
may
have
been
off
the
radar
before
celebrating
each
victory
no
matter
how
small
will
demonstrate
progress
and
help
to
build
a
sense
of
accomplishment
in
conclusion
taking
small
steps
to
continually
work
towards
long term
goals
will
benefit
us
in
many
ways
it
can
help
us
stay
motivated
manage
our
time
more
efficiently
and
feel
proud
of
our
accomplishments
put
simply
always
doing
something
gives
us
something
to
smile
about
first
impressions
are
incredibly
powerful
often
an
opinion
formed
in
a
matter
of
moments
can
remain
unchanged
for
our
entire
lives
this
is
because
humans
make
biased
decisions
in
order
to
quickly
and
effectively
evaluate
a
situation
the
introduction
of
a
new
person
to
a
situation
often
requires
rapid
assessment
and
so
we
tend
to
make
a
snap
judgement
almost
instantly
we
then
use
this
first
impression
as
a
basis
for
all
our
future
opinions
of
this
person
this
bias
makes
it
difficult
for
us
to
take
the
time
to
evolve
our
impression
even
if
our
initial
assessment
was
wrong
for
example
people
who
always
dress
formally
are
often
assumed
to
be
stuffy
or
conservative
however
this
first
impression
may
not
match
up
with
their
true
personality
in
reality
instead
of
taking
the
time
to
get
to
know
them
on
a
deeper
level
we
often
remain
stuck
in
this
first
impression
and
thus
never
quite
accurately
gauging
who
this
person
truly
is
another
example
is
in
the
workplace
an
employee
who
performs
a
task
poorly
in
the
beginning
may
be
seen
as
incompetent
regardless
of
if
their
performance
improves
over
time
this
is
a
form
of
bias
known
as
the
halo
effect
our
first
impression
sets
the
stage
for
all
future
interactions
and
it
is
difficult
to
depart
from
that
it
is
clear
why
it
is
so
difficult
to
change
a
first
impression
often
it
requires
more
effort
than
people
are
willing
to
give
in
order
for
them
to
understand
who
a
person
actually
is
we
lean
more
towards
taking
the
path
of
least
resistance
and
when
it
comes
to
changing
our
opinion
that
means
staying
with
our
first
impression
it
is
not
impossible
to
change
of
course
but
it
is
a
difficult
feat
and
one
which
should
be
done
with
caution
having
a
curfew
is
a
great
way
to
benefit
teenagers
a
curfew
helps
to
regulate
the
activities
that
teens
engage
in
and
promote
a
sense
of
personal
discipline
in
teens
with
a
curfew
teens
receive
ample
time
to
finish
their
school
work
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
and
contribute
to
any
chores
assigned
by
their
parents
by
providing
a
set
time
to
be
home
curfews
offer
teens
structure
and
guidance
that
they
need
to
maintain
positive
behavior
compared
to
not
having
a
curfew
the
advantage
of
establishing
a
curfew
is
that
it
ensures
that
teens
are
home
at
a
set
time
and
it
encourages
them
to
be
in
the
house
after
dark
without
this
sense
of
restriction
teenagers
may
become
more
vulnerable
to
getting
into
dangerous
situations
due
to
peer
pressure
by
having
a
curfew
teens
are
encouraged
to
select
activities
that
are
within
the
restriction
of
the
time
thus
allowing
for
healthy
habits
to
be
formed
when
it
comes
to
the
workplace
and
public
having
a
curfew
allows
for
a
better
attitude
and
behavior
among
teens
with
a
curfew
in
place
teens
feel
pressure
to
finish
up
assignments
and
maintain
good
behavior
in
their
place
of
employment
or
while
out
in
public
this
creates
a
positive
and
productive
environment
that
both
employers
and
customers
can
benefit
from
an
earlier
curfew
also
helps
to
prevent
teens
from
getting
into
trouble
by
having
a
curfew
of
teens
are
less
likely
to
be
out
and
about
engaging
in
risky
behaviors
such
as
drinking
or
drug
use
furthermore
it
greatly
reduces
the
chances
of
teens
being
involved
in
a
crime
or
violence
during
late
hours
in
conclusion
the
benefits
of
establishing
a
curfew
for
teenagers
far
outweigh
the
alternatives
of
not
implementing
it
it
not
only
encourages
positive
behavior
in
teens
but
also
keeps
them
safe
from
potential
harm
we
can
all
agree
that
a
curfew
is
an
essential
tool
for
fostering
discipline
among
our
youth
research
has
shown
that
attending
school
can
benefit
students
in
many
ways
compared
to
completing
schoolwork
at
home
attending
school
gives
students
more
opportunities
to
connect
with
classmates
and
teachers
build
relationships
and
benefit
from
better
learning
resources
in
addition
many
schools
offer
unique
programs
such
as
art
music
and
athletics
that
are
not
typically
available
when
studying
at
home
for
students
who
can
not
attend
school
due
to
physical
or
mental
illness
economic
reasons
or
perhaps
learning
difficulties
there
are
now
many
options
available
such
as
online
courses
alternative
schools
or
homeschooling
each
of
these
alternatives
can
offer
students
individualized
learning
plans
more
flexibility
and
tailored
guidance
to
ensure
educational
success
while
attending
school
and
completing
schoolwork
at
home
both
have
distinct
benefits
there
are
some
significant
differences
attending
school
offers
social
interactions
camaraderie
faculty
guidance
and
access
to
resources
that
are
difficult
to
replicate
at
home
staying
on
track
with
educational
goals
at
home
requires
strong
self discipline
and
dedication
along
with
an
individual
along
with
an
individualized
plan
that
suits
the
student
s
needs
programs
can
also
have
a
major
impact
on
students
learning
especially
programs
that
emphasize
different
perspectives
hands on
activities
and
additional
resources
furthermore
attending
school
increases
access
to
technological
resources
such
as
computers
and
digital
databases
that
can
immensely
benefit
certain
students
in
conclusion
there
are
many
benefits
of
attending
school
and
completing
schoolwork
at
home
and
each
environment
has
unique
strengths
to
offer
students
by
researching
the
different
options
students
and
educators
will
be
better
equipped
to
find
an
educational
plan
that
is
best
for
the
individual
i
decided
to
research
the
first
african american
woman
in
space
i
chose
this
project
to
learn
more
about
her
incredible
achievements
and
to
explore
the
various
kinds
of
science
experiments
and
projects
that
space
exploration
inspired
as
part
of
my
project
i
m
going
to
attempt
an
experiment
to
create
something
bubble like
to
illustrate
the
idea
of
zero
gravity
to
do
this
i
plan
to
mix
baking
soda
vinegar
dish
detergent
and
a
few
other
household
materials
with
alginate
and
observe
the
reaction
to
ensure
the
success
of
my
project
i
created
a
checklist
of
items
that
will
be
necessary
for
the
experiment
baking
measuring
containers
this
project
will
help
me
gain
a
better
understanding
of
how
zero
gravity
works
and
how
used
her
knowledge
to
shape
her
journey
into
space
it
will
also
give
me
the
opportunity
to
explore
science
experiments
and
hopefully
inspire
others
to
do
the
same
through
this
research
project
we
aim
to
investigate
whether
educational
activities
can
be
enjoyable
to
answer
our
primary
question
we
will
need
to
examine
what
types
of
educational
activities
people
find
enjoyable
and
how
individual
preferences
affect
their
enjoyment
we
must
also
consider
the
benefits
of
engaging
in
educational
activities
that
are
enjoyable
versus
those
that
are
not
finally
we
must
assess
whether
the
benefits
of
enjoyable
educational
activities
are
greater
than
those
of
their
non enjoyable
counterparts
by
answering
these
questions
we
will
determine
if
educational
activities
can
indeed
be
enjoyable
high
school
is
a
time
of
transition
and
learning
for
students
a
time
when
they
are
discovering
who
they
are
and
what
they
want
to
be
in
the
future
as
such
it
can
be
argued
that
it
s
too
soon
to
require
young
people
to
know
what
career
they
ultimately
want
to
pursue
by
high
school
many
students
explore
a
wide
range
of
interests
while
in
high
school
and
what
they
re
passionate
about
might
change
over
time
without
the
necessary
experiences
or
educational
opportunities
in
high
school
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
decide
on
a
career
path
before
they
graduate
in
addition
forcing
students
to
decide
on
a
career
by
the
time
they
graduate
high
school
could
lead
to
them
making
less than optimal
decisions
without
the
guidance
of
an
experienced
advisor
or
guidance
counselor
young
people
might
not
be
fully
aware
of
the
career
options
available
to
them
or
ready
to
pursue
a
profession
right
away
on
the
other
hand
it
s
important
for
students
to
have
an
idea
of
what
careers
they
re
interested
in
as
early
as
possible
this
can
help
with
college
planning
and
with
focusing
energy
on
the
right
subjects
high
school
is
an
important
time
for
education
and
self discovery
and
it
s
also
a
perfect
opportunity
for
students
to
explore
a
number
of
potential
career
pathways
having
an
open minded
approach
and
actively
seeking
college
and
career
guidance
can
give
young
people
the
means
to
make
informed
decisions
and
explore
their
goals
in
conclusion
requiring
high
schoolers
to
choose
a
career
path
by
the
time
they
graduate
isn
t
feasible
or
beneficial
instead
providing
students
with
the
tools
and
information
necessary
to
explore
potential
careers
and
make
informed
choices
can
help
them
become
more
confident
informed
decision makers
technology
has
been
increasingly
used
to
supplement
educational
performance
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
in
the
classroom
technology
can
be
used
to
facilitate
learning
and
to
encourage
students
to
take
ownership
of
their
learning
for
example
digital
tools
can
be
used
to
facilitate
learning
outcomes
such
as
interactive
online
quizzes
and
games
technology
can
also
help
students
become
more
engaged
in
their
own
learning
as
they
are
able
to
take
advantage
of
resources
that
may
have
otherwise
been
difficult
to
access
outside
the
classroom
technology
can
be
used
to
promote
physical
activity
wearables
such
as
smartwatches
can
be
used
to
track
progress
over
time
motivating
students
to
stay
active
and
engaged
with
physical
activity
social
media
platforms
can
be
used
to
post
about
upcoming
physical
activities
or
for
students
to
post
pictures
or
videos
of
themselves
participating
in
physical
activities
in
sum
technology
can
be
used
to
enhance
educational
performance
and
promote
physical
activity
for
students
however
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
technology
is
used
in
an
appropriate
manner
in
school
environments
technology
should
be
used
as
an
aid
and
supplement
to
learning
not
as
a
replacement
for
traditional
educational
methods
for
example
face to face
interaction
with
teachers
should
not
be
replaced
with
online
tutorials
in
addition
all
technology
use
should
be
managed
carefully
and
with
appropriate
safety
precautions
in
place
such
as
parental
consent
forms
for
minors
utilizing
online
learning
technologies
one
of
the
benefits
of
online
classes
for
students
who
have
difficulty
coming
to
school
or
those
who
work
is
that
the
classes
are
available
in
the
evening
this
allows
students
to
still
take
courses
in
their
chosen
field
without
having
to
leave
work
or
even
their
own
home
this
also
makes
it
easier
for
people
to
reach
their
educational
goals
and
progress
in
their
career
without
having
to
rely
solely
on
conventional
learning
despite
the
many
advantages
of
online
classes
some
people
believe
it
is
a
waste
of
time
however
when
courses
are
properly
designed
and
planned
they
can
provide
an
effective
learning
experience
studies
have
suggested
that
students
who
take
online
classes
often
have
an
easier
time
comprehending
material
due
to
the
interactive
nature
of
the
classes
given
the
many
benefits
of
online
classes
all
students
should
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
when
available
by
taking
these
classes
students
have
the
potential
to
expand
their
capabilities
and
better
prepare
themselves
for
further
education
or
even
a
career
in
a
promising
field
ultimately
online
classes
provide
an
accessible
way
for
anyone
to
enhance
their
education
while
still
attending
to
their
daily
responsibilities
afterschool
programs
can
offer
students
a
range
of
advantages
that
impact
both
their
academic
and
personal
development
these
programs
can
provide
students
with
an
opportunity
to
strengthen
their
skills
in
and
outside
of
the
classroom
making
homework
easier
and
providing
a
support
system
for
students
with
disabilities
for
example
the
in
offers
a
variety
of
activities
designed
to
improve
students
study
habits
and
encourage
academic
excellence
through
a
combination
of
tutoring
opportunities
interactive
activities
and
field
trips
the
lets
students
gain
a
better
understanding
of
their
educational
objectives
furthermore
teachers
and
counselors
are
available
to
provide
personalized
guidance
and
support
for
students
with
disabilities
such
programs
are
vital
for
introducing
students
to
a
variety
of
resources
and
helping
them
achieve
personal
and
academic
success
the
wonders
of
technology
have
had
a
profoundly
positive
impact
on
people
s
lives
across
the
globe
from
much
needed
improvements
in
the
medical
field
to
better
communication
capabilities
the
advancements
made
in
technology
have
opened
up
a
wide
array
of
opportunities
in
the
medical
field
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
doctors
diagnose
and
treat
various
illnesses
from
diagnostic
imaging
software
to
patient
monitoring
systems
and
robotic
surgeries
the
list
of
improvements
due
to
technology
keeps
growing
technology
has
also
drastically
changed
the
way
people
communicate
with
each
other
from
instant
messaging
to
video
conferencing
people
can
easily
communicate
with
their
loved
ones
anytime
and
anywhere
technology
has
enabled
people
to
access
a
wide
range
of
knowledge
and
information
that
would
have
otherwise
been
difficult
to
access
this
has
enabled
people
to
interact
with
different
cultures
and
expand
their
understanding
of
the
world
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
technology
has
had
an
overwhelmingly
positive
impact
on
people
s
lives
in
many
different
ways
from
faster
medical
treatments
to
more
efficient
ways
to
communicate
technology
has
profoundly
changed
the
way
we
live
our
lives
after
contemplating
which
direction
to
take
i
decided
to
ask
two
of
my
friends
for
their
advice
one
suggested
i
start
my
project
earlier
to
give
myself
more
time
to
work
on
it
while
the
other
encouraged
me
to
relax
and
enjoy
my
free
time
while
both
options
were
insightful
i
eventually
chose
the
option
that
i
thought
would
work
best
for
me
after
taking
action
i
realized
that
the
decision
i
made
was
ultimately
my
own
and
not
the
mistake
of
the
person
who
gave
me
the
advice
i
appreciated
their
support
and
thanked
them
both
for
helping
me
out
once
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
his
words
are
filled
with
truth
and
wisdom
that
can
be
seen
in
all
aspects
of
our
lives
is
rarely
just
a
matter
of
having
a
good
plan
and
getting
it
perfectly
right
the
first
time
it
often
involves
going
through
failure
as
part
of
the
process
no
matter
what
the
setback
having
the
determination
to
carry
on
without
allowing
yourself
to
lose
enthusiasm
and
focus
can
be
the
key
to
eventual
success
when
dealing
with
failure
it
s
important
to
take
the
time
to
learn
from
it
the
mistakes
that
have
been
made
the
actions
that
can
be
improved
the
goals
that
were
too
ambitious
having
that
kind
of
perspective
and
an
understanding
that
setbacks
can
provide
valuable
information
can
be
hugely
beneficial
in
developing
an
approach
that
will
bring
eventual
success
the
causes
of
failure
are
numerous
and
varied
from
external
factors
such
as
marketplace
or
social
pressures
to
individual
skills
or
capabilities
whatever
the
cause
success
can
only
be
achieved
through
understanding
embracing
and
learning
from
these
failures
no
one
should
expect
success
to
be
easy
to
come
by
and
in
this
age
of
intense
competition
resilience
and
perseverance
are
more
important
than
ever
ultimately
as
so
famously
observed
it
is
your
willingness
to
continue
that
counts
with
courage
and
determination
success
can
be
achieved
despite
any
and
all
setbacks
that
may
come
along
the
way
many
students
find
themselves
faced
with
the
difficult
task
of
pursing
their
desired
courses
of
study
and
life
goals
with
limited
resources
available
to
them
one
potential
strategy
to
alleviate
some
of
the
financial
concerns
associated
with
acquiring
higher
education
may
be
for
schools
to
explore
partnerships
with
companies
that
could
offer
support
and
companies
partnering
together
can
present
various
benefits
to
individual
students
including
increased
financial
aid
options
for
example
companies
may
provide
loan
options
to
students
with
preferential
repayment
terms
to
make
managing
the
burden
of
loan
debt
more
manageable
companies
may
also
offer
opportunities
for
students
to
work
while
in
school
which
could
help
them
gain
work
experience
while
providing
some
more
financial
stability
the
impact
of
such
partnerships
could
be
far reaching
from
a
student
s
ability
to
gain
real world
experience
to
the
mental
and
financial
stress
relief
that
could
be
experienced
through
increased
access
to
loan
and
employment
options
through
partnerships
between
schools
and
companies
individual
students
may
benefit
from
increased
resources
that
could
lead
them
towards
the
successful
achievement
of
their
desired
courses
of
study
and
life
goals
humans
have
a
natural
desire
to
fit
in
in
society
but
often
this
can
come
at
a
price
one
of
the
most
common
ways
in
which
people
attempt
to
fit
in
is
by
imitating
others
especially
those
we
admire
and
aspire
to
be
like
while
this
can
be
seen
as
an
advantage
allowing
us
to
pick
up
positive
qualities
from
role
models
who
are
already
successful
it
can
also
have
drawbacks
for
example
by
trying
to
fit
in
and
act
a
certain
way
we
can
become
afraid
of
making
mistakes
we
become
so
fixated
with
blending
in
that
we
can
unwittingly
compromise
our
own
character
and
originality
at
the
same
time
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
often
our
character
is
formed
by
several
influences
beyond
our
control
from
the
people
we
look
up
to
to
our
upbringing
and
environment
we
are
unavoidably
shaped
by
outside
forces
however
while
we
can
not
control
what
external
influences
there
are
we
can
decide
how
we
react
to
them
and
determine
the
level
to
which
they
will
shape
our
character
there
are
valid
arguments
to
be
made
both
for
and
against
extending
school
hours
supporters
cite
the
benefits
of
giving
students
more
time
to
develop
their
learning
and
practice
the
skills
needed
for
academic
success
in
addition
proponents
argue
that
having
more
time
in
school
allows
teachers
to
cover
more
content
in
greater
depth
giving
students
the
opportunity
to
delve
more
deeply
into
the
topics
they
are
learning
about
on
the
other
hand
detractors
claim
that
longer
school
hours
can
be
detrimental
to
students
physical
and
mental
health
ultimately
leading
to
greater
burnout
and
decreased
academic
achievement
after
giving
careful
consideration
to
the
arguments
on
both
sides
i
believe
that
longer
school
hours
should
not
be
implemented
while
having
more
time
in
school
can
provide
students
with
opportunities
to
strengthen
their
academic
skills
it
can
also
be
detrimental
to
their
health
and
well being
studies
have
shown
that
when
students
have
too
little
sleep
and
too
much
stress
their
academic
performance
and
motivation
decreases
furthermore
the
mental
and
physical
strain
of
extended
school
hours
could
be
a
contributing
factor
to
the
rising
rates
of
anxiety
and
depression
among
teens
ultimately
i
believe
that
the
best
way
to
ensure
academic
success
is
to
provide
students
with
a
balanced
education
that
puts
their
mental
and
physical
health
first
this
could
involve
shorter
school
hours
and
more
optional
activities
such
as
sports
and
art
classes
as
well
as
providing
students
with
access
to
mental
health
support
services
by
providing
students
with
these
means
of
support
and
free
choice
we
can
ensure
that
their
academic
performance
and
well being
are
both
prioritized
throughout
history
there
have
been
endless
examples
of
people
who
have
turned
failure
into
success
a
athlete
is
a
powerful
example
of
how
failure
can
be
turned
into
success
despite
contracting
polio
when
she
was
a
toddler
she
overcame
it
and
went
on
to
become
the
first
american
black
woman
to
win
three
gold
medals
in
the
olympics
her
example
shows
that
success
comes
with
hard
work
perseverance
and
optimism
even
in
the
face
of
adversity
in
contrast
failure
can
be
discouraging
or
even
detrimental
to
some
sometimes
facing
failure
with
a
negative
attitude
can
derail
success
and
make
it
harder
to
get
motivated
this
could
be
because
those
with
a
negative
attitude
view
failure
as
absolute
rather
than
something
to
learn
from
and
build
upon
on
the
other
hand
some
people
have
the
opinion
that
failure
should
be
embraced
and
seen
as
a
learning
opportunity
entrepreneur
famously
said
your
challenge
is
not
to
avoid
mistakes
but
to
recognize
that
failure
is
a
path
to
personal
growth
this
emphasizes
that
failure
should
be
taken
as
a
way
to
grow
and
develop
valuable
skills
is
a
fine
example
of
how
coming
back
from
failure
is
very
much
possible
despite
being
homeless
with
his
son
he
never
gave
up
on
his
entrepreneurial
dreams
and
went
on
to
found
his
own
stockbrokerage
firm
he
teaches
us
that
success
means
never
taking
no
for
an
answer
and
that
everyone
can
start
again
if
they
choose
to
the
resilience
some
have
when
faced
with
failure
can
often
come
from
their
willingness
to
take
risks
and
stay
optimistic
about
the
future
having
a
growth
mindset
helps
to
keep
failure
from
spiraling
into
a
deeper
pit
of
confusion
and
regret
focusing
on
the
positive
and
staying
motivated
in
the
face
of
adversity
will
empower
people
to
brush
off
failures
more
quickly
and
continue
on
towards
success
in
conclusion
failure
is
just
as
important
as
success
in
many
aspects
of
life
not
only
does
it
give
people
the
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
but
it
can
also
shape
their
personality
and
give
them
the
confidence
to
take
measured
risks
people
should
stay
motivated
and
optimistic
when
faced
with
failure
and
use
it
as
a
stepping
stone
towards
success
had
done
lots
of
research
into
what
career
he
wanted
to
pursue
after
high
school
and
felt
confident
that
he
wanted
to
become
an
engineer
however
he
was
n t
sure
which
classes
at
his
high
school
would
be
best
for
him
to
take
in
order
to
help
him
prepare
for
his
career
to
get
some
guidance
he
decided
to
talk
to
one
of
his
school
s
guidance
counselors
the
counselor
told
that
taking
physics
calculus
computer
programming
and
engineering
classes
would
be
very
helpful
for
him
in
his
future
endeavors
he
also
mentioned
that
the
courses
would
give
opportunity
to
develop
new
abilities
such
as
problem
solving
and
critical
thinking
as
well
as
enable
him
to
acquire
industry standard
knowledge
and
advance
his
technical
skills
with
this
information
felt
more
informed
and
prepared
to
make
the
best
educational
decisions
for
himself
is
an
invaluable
tool
for
both
the
giver
and
the
receiver
when
people
ask
for
advice
it
is
often
because
they
need
help
making
a
difficult
decision
or
are
seeking
guidance
on
how
to
approach
a
particular
situation
they
are
looking
for
somebody
to
offer
a
perspective
that
they
may
not
have
considered
or
seen
before
the
rewards
of
giving
advice
are
two fold
the
act
of
offering
thoughtfulness
and
care
to
someone
can
bring
the
giver
satisfaction
knowing
that
they
have
contributed
positively
to
someone
else
s
life
by
sharing
their
story
and
advice
the
giver
can
unlock
hidden
wisdom
within
themselves
as
the
act
of
revisiting
their
experiences
and
reflecting
on
them
can
lead
to
greater
insight
and
personal
growth
when
the
advice
giver
takes
the
time
to
really
understand
the
advice
recipient
s
situation
they
can
offer
tailored
advice
that
is
tailor made
to
help
the
person
move
forwards
this
process
of
giving
advice
can
be
immensely
beneficial
to
both
parties
for
the
receiver
they
can
gain
insight
and
clarity
about
a
situation
giving
them
guidance
on
the
best
course
of
action
for
the
giver
they
can
gain
a
sense
of
fulfillment
made
from
helping
someone
in
need
and
a
greater
understanding
of
their
own
experiences
and
feelings
ultimately
giving
advice
can
be
a
powerful
and
deeply
rewarding
act
for
both
parties
i
strongly
believe
that
a
positive
attitude
is
the
key
to
success
in
life
i
have
seen
this
principle
in
action
many
times
for
example
when
i
was
in
university
i
was
struggling
with
a
difficult
assignment
at
first
i
had
a
negative
attitude
and
was
convinced
i
could
not
complete
it
by
taking
a
step
back
and
focusing
on
the
positive
aspects
of
the
task
i
was
eventually
able
to
finish
it
success
was
a
direct
result
of
my
changing
attitude
another
example
is
my
friend
who
was
unemployed
for
a
long
time
he
became
increasingly
discouraged
but
he
eventually
decided
to
change
his
attitude
and
stay
positive
he
made
new
contacts
revised
his
resume
and
started
to
actively
search
for
new
opportunities
enough
he
landed
a
great
job
at
a
company
he
really
wanted
to
work
for
finally
when
i
was
running
my
first
marathon
i
was
determined
to
finish
it
but
i
was
so
exhausted
by
the
middle
of
the
race
that
i
thought
it
was
impossible
by
maintaining
a
positive
mindset
i
was
able
to
push
through
and
cross
the
finish
line
in
conclusion
i
believe
that
a
positive
attitude
is
the
key
to
success
in
life
and
is
essential
to
meeting
your
goals
by
believing
in
yourself
and
setting
your
sights
high
you
will
be
more
likely
to
overcome
any
challenge
and
reach
your
desired
outcome
as
more
and
more
students
are
working
during
the
school
year
either
to
earn
extra
spending
money
or
to
gain
valuable
job
experience
it
is
important
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
having
students
work
during
school
at
a
young
age
on
the
one
hand
a
student
s
job
can
help
put
them
in
a
better
financial
situation
for
college
and
set
a
foundation
for
their
future
career
working
at
a
young
age
can
also
teach
students
how
to
effectively
manage
their
time
improve
their
communication
and
relationship building
skills
and
provide
them
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
on
the
other
hand
a
student
that
works
during
the
school
year
can
easily
become
overwhelmed
and
stressed
with
balancing
their
school
work
and
job
if
not
carefully
monitored
working
during
school
can
have
a
harmful
effect
on
a
student
s
academic
performance
and
personal
well being
additionally
most
student
jobs
are
entry level
and
can
provide
limited
experience
as
employers
are
more
likely
to
hire
more
experienced
job
seekers
over
high
schoolers
as
a
result
it
is
important
for
students
to
consider
their
ability
to
manage
a
job
and
school
before
committing
to
one
and
for
parents
and
educators
to
pay
attention
and
guide
the
student
to
ensure
they
are
not
overwhelmed
with
the
right
guidance
and
careful
consideration
of
the
potential
risks
and
rewards
working
during
school
at
a
young
age
can
be
a
great
experience
that
sets
students
up
for
success
self belief
is
essential
for
success
as
it
allows
people
to
maintain
their
enthusiasm
and
fears
in
check
failure
is
almost
inevitable
in
life
but
how
people
handle
failure
determines
the
outcome
people
who
learn
from
their
past
mistakes
can
move
forward
with
the
necessary
steps
to
progress
and
become
better
practicing
mistakes
and
turning
them
into
opportunities
is
key
small
business
owners
often
achieve
tremendous
success
by
being
creative
driven
and
ambitious
this
statement
success
is
going
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
reflects
the
idea
that
you
should
not
be
discouraged
by
failure
but
instead
remain
passionate
towards
your
goals
setting
attainable
goals
can
be
an
effective
tool
to
help
manage
success
is
a
part
of
life
and
from
many
different
sources
it
often
starts
from
our
parents
who
offer
us
guidance
as
we
grow
up
and
experience
the
world
around
us
teachers
also
provide
advice
not
only
on
our
studies
but
also
in
terms
of
personal
development
and
decision
making
friends
also
offer
advice
not
only
for
social
situations
but
also
on
big
decisions
other
people
such
as
neighbors
or
acquaintances
can
also
provide
us
with
advice
though
it
may
be
harder
to
take
from
someone
we
don
t
know
well
in
general
the
advice
that
we
receive
from
our
parents
and
teachers
is
usually
more
valuable
while
advice
from
friends
may
be
well intentioned
some
of
it
may
be
biased
by
their
personal
experiences
and
decisions
these
sources
provide
a
more
objective
view
that
can
help
us
make
wise
decisions
that
we
may
not
have
considered
they
may
also
have
more
life
experience
to
draw
from
when
offering
advice
ultimately
it
is
up
to
us
to
decide
which
advice
to
take
and
which
to
leave
behind
as
the
threat
of
global
warming
becomes
more
imminent
it
is
increasingly
important
to
find
ways
to
conserve
energy
and
resources
doing
so
can
help
reduce
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
and
other
harmful
greenhouse
gases
that
contribute
to
climate
change
there
are
numerous
benefits
associated
with
conserving
energy
and
resources
these
include
reduced
costs
and
environmental
damage
improved
public
health
and
increased
reliability
of
the
energy
supply
at
the
same
time
there
are
some
disadvantages
to
conserving
energy
and
resources
one
of
the
most
significant
is
that
the
transition
away
from
traditional
energy
sources
can
be
challenging
and
costly
in
addition
government
regulations
and
other
initiatives
may
result
in
higher
costs
for
businesses
and
consumers
in
the
short
term
to
effectively
conserve
energy
and
resources
it
is
essential
to
have
a
plan
this
plan
should
incorporate
existing
and
emerging
technologies
as
well
as
economic
and
political
factors
it
should
strive
to
reduce
waste
and
promote
energy
efficiency
examples
of
such
plans
include
providing
incentives
for
energy efficient
appliances
and
vehicles
incentivizing
renewable
energy
production
and
encouraging
public
transportation
in
addition
it
is
important
to
promote
education
about
the
importance
of
conserving
energy
and
resources
throughout
the
population
together
these
measures
will
help
ensure
we
have
a
sustainable
energy
and
resource
system
for
the
future
in
just
a
few
short
decades
technology
has
revolutionized
the
economies
of
countries
around
the
world
from
advanced
production
processes
to
more
efficient
consumer
interactions
businesses
of
all
sizes
and
sectors
have
adopted
modern
technologies
to
streamline
operations
and
maximize
profits
restaurants
and
are
no
exception
at
technology
has
given
a
distinct
edge
to
the
automotive
manufacturing
process
automated
production
lines
have
replaced
manual
labor
and
sophisticated
tracking
systems
keep
track
of
every
aspect
of
the
production
process
has
enabled
to
build
cars
faster
while
maintaining
the
highest
level
of
quality
and
efficiency
in
the
restaurant
industry
mobile
ordering
payment
and
delivery
systems
have
changed
the
way
business
is
conducted
by
implementing
technologies
like
and
machine
learning
restaurants
can
easily
accept
orders
online
pay
without
cash
and
even
deliver
orders
directly
to
customers
homes
these
changes
have
allowed
restaurants
to
work
more
efficiently
while
increasing
customer
satisfaction
finally
has
taken
advantage
of
technology
to
reduce
costs
and
improve
its
customer
experience
through
the
use
of
inventory
and
supply
chain
management
solutions
can
accurately
track
the
availability
of
goods
and
dynamically
adjust
prices
for
consumers
in
addition
has
also
implemented
an
automated
checkout
system
enabling
customers
to
quickly
and
conveniently
pay
for
their
items
with
little
effort
technology
has
had
a
major
impact
on
the
economy
and
human
interactions
by
leveraging
technology
businesses
like
restaurants
and
have
stayed
ahead
of
the
competition
and
provided
better
customer
experiences
it
is
clear
that
technology
will
continue
to
shape
the
economy
and
our
everyday
interactions
for
years
to
come
dear
i
am
writing
to
propose
an
adjustment
to
our
school
s
policy
regarding
academic
eligibility
for
participation
in
school
sports
and
activities
after
researching
our
current
policy
and
those
of
other
schools
i
believe
that
making
the
change
to
require
a
average
in
order
to
stay
eligible
for
these
activities
could
have
a
positive
impact
on
our
students
academic
performance
the
research
i
have
conducted
shows
that
schools
that
have
these
types
of
policies
in
place
have
seen
improved
grades
among
students
who
participate
in
school
sports
or
activities
furthermore
these
standards
could
help
motivate
students
to
achieve
higher
grades
and
reach
their
academic
goals
i
realize
that
implementing
this
change
could
be
met
with
some
opposition
but
i
believe
it
could
have
lasting
positive
benefits
for
the
students
at
our
school
i
look
forward
to
discussing
this
proposal
further
with
you
and
getting
your
feedback
sincerely
your
name
after
extensive
research
on
the
pros
and
cons
of
attending
only
three
years
of
high
school
education
instead
of
the
traditional
four year
program
it
appears
that
some
major
points
must
be
considered
from
the
perspective
of
the
student
attending
only
three
years
of
high
school
would
reduce
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
school
which
can
be
beneficial
depending
on
the
quality
of
one
s
educational
experience
it
can
also
allow
one
to
quite
literally
fast track
their
educational
ambitions
the
main
downside
concerns
the
age
at
which
the
student
would
be
graduating
going
off
to
college
or
entering
the
workforce
as
a
young
adult
three
years
earlier
than
the
norm
can
be
a
daunting
experience
for
some
individuals
as
well
a
lack
of
educational
experience
as
compared
to
one
s
peers
can
be
a
substantial
hindrance
based
on
the
research
conducted
it
could
be
concluded
that
the
three year
program
was
unsuitable
for
some
students
especially
those
that
may
not
be
fully
ready
to
be
out
on
their
own
as
a
young
adult
however
there
are
students
that
may
benefit
greatly
from
such
a
program
if
they
are
mature
focused
and
confident
in
their
aspirations
ultimately
the
student
should
gain
advice
from
health
and
education
professionals
before
making
a
decision
about
the
program
individual
traits
come
in
two
forms
innate
and
acquired
traits
are
those
we
are
born
with
while
acquired
traits
are
those
we
develop
over
time
we
are
bound
to
both
and
our
choices
can
have
profound
impacts
on
how
we
interact
with
others
traits
such
as
personality
type
aptitude
and
even
outlook
on
life
are
largely
a
product
of
genetics
and
affect
the
paths
our
lives
take
we
often
make
decisions
based
on
these
traits
without
much
thought
on
the
other
hand
acquired
traits
such
as
values
hobbies
and
interests
are
chosen
by
us
and
can
provide
us
with
a
sense
of
purpose
belonging
and
contribute
to
our
self development
each
type
of
trait
has
its
own
benefits
and
drawbacks
traits
can
be
unchangeable
while
acquired
traits
allow
us
to
adapt
traits
can
provide
stability
while
acquired
traits
give
us
the
opportunity
to
grow
both
types
of
traits
shape
the
way
we
interact
with
others
as
people
often
judge
us
based
on
our
behavior
and
beliefs
while
it
is
important
to
accept
our
individual
traits
it
is
also
important
to
stand
out
for
ourselves
our
choices
have
profound
impacts
on
the
people
around
us
and
making
choices
in
line
with
our
values
can
help
us
create
a
better
world
we
can
use
both
our
innate
and
acquired
traits
to
find
and
live
authentic
lives
and
by
doing
so
we
can
influence
others
to
do
the
same
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
comes
with
many
benefits
to
begin
with
when
one
has
a
positive
attitude
they
form
a
good
reputation
in
other
words
a
person
with
a
positive
outlook
on
life
is
more
likely
to
be
seen
as
trustworthy
since
they
are
open
to
different
experiences
and
willing
to
take
on
challenges
moreover
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
others
around
us
it
creates
a
calming
energy
and
healthy
relationships
it
encourages
others
to
see
the
silver
lining
in
any
situation
even
when
faced
with
difficulty
one
can
still
strive
to
be
optimistic
and
in
doing
so
help
others
stay
motivated
real life
examples
of
the
importance
of
positive
attitude
are
easy
to
find
for
instance
when
faced
with
an
illness
having
a
positive
attitude
may
help
ease
the
burden
and
challenge
of
the
situation
additionally
when
one
goes
through
a
difficult
period
in
their
life
staying
positive
can
bring
personal
growth
and
new
perspectives
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
is
key
to
a
successful
and
healthy
life
it
affects
how
one
looks
at
life
s
obstacles
and
encourages
them
to
stay
hopeful
and
motivated
people
tend
to
be
drawn
to
those
who
have
a
positive
outlook
and
helping
others
feel
the
same
can
create
powerful
relationships
with
the
right
attitude
almost
anything
is
possible
choosing
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
offer
certain
benefits
such
as
increased
focus
and
determination
as
well
as
the
opportunity
to
plan
accordingly
for
future
milestones
students
in
high
school
should
take
advantage
of
the
resources
available
to
them
to
explore
and
discover
potential
career
paths
researching
occupations
talking
to
individuals
in
the
field
and
attending
workshops
and
programs
are
all
viable
options
for
identifying
a
career
additionally
examining
the
stories
and
examples
of
others
who
have
chosen
their
career
paths
can
be
exceptionally
beneficial
in
providing
insight
and
direction
ultimately
it
is
up
to
each
individual
to
decide
how
and
when
to
commit
to
a
career
despite
the
potential
risks
devoting
oneself
to
a
field
of
study
early
on
may
grant
additional
time
to
research
and
develop
the
skills
that
are
necessary
for
success
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
grant
more
time
to
specialize
in
a
chosen
field
providing
a
competitive
advantage
along
the
way
according
to
the
for
statistics
most
schools
in
the
are
typically
in
session
for
around
seven
to
seven
and
a
half
hours
each
day
this
number
however
pales
in
comparison
to
the
many
countries
around
the
world
where
students
attend
school
for
over
eight
hours
each
day
with
the
possibility
of
extending
school
hours
in
the
it
is
important
to
consider
how
this
may
impact
students
beyond
the
classroom
in
the
states
students
often
engage
in
a
variety
of
activities
after
school
such
as
soccer
practice
guitar
lessons
or
volunteering
with
extended
school
hours
the
potential
for
these
activities
to
be
cut
out
increases
leading
to
a
significant
disruption
to
students
leisure
activities
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
physical
and
emotional
impacts
that
extended
school
hours
will
have
on
students
can
students
who
are
expected
to
take
part
in
a
variety
of
after school
activities
balance
the
increased
workload
will
it
be
to
the
detriment
of
their
physical
and
mental
health
extended
school
hours
could
also
increase
stress
for
both
students
and
their
families
parents
may
need
to
adjust
their
work
schedules
in
order
to
accommodate
the
additional
hours
while
also
finding
ways
to
supervise
children
after
school
students
may
feel
the
pressure
of
being
expected
to
perform
better
due
to
the
extended
hours
given
the
potential
consequences
of
extended
school
hours
it
is
necessary
to
properly
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
any
decisions
deciding
on
a
career
path
when
leaving
high
school
can
be
a
daunting
task
for
many
students
there
are
a
lot
of
options
out
there
and
many
pros
and
cons
to
consider
while
considering
these
pros
and
cons
it
is
important
for
students
to
look
at
both
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
making
a
decision
at
a
young
age
versus
waiting
until
after
high
school
on
one
hand
many
parents
urge
their
young
children
to
start
planning
for
college
and
a
career
early
therefore
making
a
decision
at
a
young
age
making
a
decision
early
allows
students
to
focus
their
studies
on
the
type
of
career
or
field
they
wish
to
pursue
and
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
specialize
in
something
they
truly
enjoy
on
the
other
hand
making
a
decision
too
soon
can
be
difficult
if
the
student
ends
up
not
liking
what
they
chose
and
may
lead
to
them
feeling
a
lack
of
commitment
or
being
stuck
with
a
decision
that
was
made
too
early
waiting
until
after
high
school
may
give
students
more
time
to
explore
different
options
and
find
something
they
are
actually
passionate
about
however
this
can
lead
to
students
feeling
lost
or
unsure
of
what
direction
they
should
take
additionally
waiting
too
long
may
lead
to
students
not
knowing
where
to
begin
or
feeling
overwhelmed
by
the
number
of
options
available
in
the
end
it
is
up
to
the
student
to
decide
which
path
is
right
for
them make
a
decision
early
and
focus
their
studies
on
something
they
are
passionate
about
or
wait
and
explore
different
options
before
making
a
final
decision
many
students
and
parents
eagerly
anticipate
the
summer
break
looking
forward
to
days
spent
relaxing
travelling
and
engaging
in
leisure
activities
a
comparison
of
a
regular
summer
break
to
one
that
is
shorter
reveals
that
there
are
advantages
and
downsides
to
each
from
an
educator
s
point
of
view
a
long
summer
break
allows
students
more
time
for
personal
growth
and
exploration
as
well
as
time
to
rest
and
relax
before
returning
to
the
rigor
of
school
it
also
provides
an
extra
few
weeks
for
students
to
continue
or
start
an
academic
pursuit
such
as
a
summer
course
or
program
in
terms
of
academic
benefits
research
suggests
that
when
students
return
after
a
long
summer
break
there
is
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
knowledge
forgetting
students
are
said
to
retain
a
substantial
amount
of
information
that
was
discovered
in
the
previous
school
year
and
this
can
be
beneficial
for
continued
development
moreover
having
a
longer
break
has
been
thought
to
improve
social
and
emotional
development
by
giving
students
time
to
develop
new
skills
and
pursue
new
interests
still
some
studies
suggest
a
longer
summer
break
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
learning
for
example
the
extra
time
away
from
the
classroom
can
lead
to
a
sense
of
forgetfulness
and
decreased
motivation
to
learn
even
with
the
positive
aspects
it
is
important
to
assess
the
impact
a
long
summer
break
has
on
students
ability
to
retain
information
and
consider
potential
ways
to
keep
them
engaged
during
the
break
ultimately
each
school
must
weigh
the
positives
and
negatives
of
extending
summer
breaks
and
make
their
own
determination
on
what
length
of
break
is
most
appropriate
for
their
particular
students
the
school
cafeteria
is
the
main
source
of
meals
for
many
students
so
it
s
essential
that
the
food
it
provides
is
nutritious
and
healthy
unfortunately
the
current
menu
consists
of
processed
unhealthy
options
that
contain
an
excessive
amount
of
sugar
and
salt
this
is
highly
damaging
to
students
physical
and
mental
health
unhealthy
food
can
cause
obesity
and
other
health
issues
such
as
high
cholesterol
high
blood
pressure
and
type
diabetes
these
health
complications
can
have
long term
effects
that
interfere
with
learning
and
development
in
addition
to
health
problems
unhealthy
food
can
cause
poor
concentration
and
fatigue
as
well
as
mood
swings
and
other
behavioral
problems
has
shown
that
improved
nutrition
leads
to
improved
academic
performance
therefore
it
s
wise
to
change
the
school
cafeteria
menu
to
offer
healthier
food
choices
healthy
meals
should
include
more
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
whole
grains
legumes
lean
proteins
and
low fat
dairy
products
they
should
be
low
in
saturated
fats
trans
fats
and
sugar
and
they
should
contain
plenty
of
essential
vitamins
and
minerals
increasing
the
variety
of
healthy
lunches
will
provide
students
with
the
nutrients
they
need
to
remain
energized
and
focused
throughout
the
day
by
offering
healthier
food
choices
in
the
school
cafeteria
we
can
ensure
that
students
are
getting
the
nutrition
they
need
to
stay
healthy
perform
better
in
school
and
be
more
productive
therefore
changing
the
menu
to
include
nutritious
meals
is
essential
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
in
the
century
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
imagine
how
we
functioned
without
the
help
of
technology
for
so
many
tasks
and
duties
technology
has
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
people
s
lives
on
the
positive
side
technology
offers
convenience
and
accessibility
to
people
it
makes
daily
tasks
easier
and
can
decrease
the
time
it
takes
us
to
complete
them
communication
is
also
greatly
enhanced
because
of
the
internet
and
all
of
the
different
ways
we
can
now
contact
each
other
such
as
emails
messaging
apps
and
social
media
additionally
technology
helps
us
get
access
to
a
wealth
of
information
that
might
otherwise
be
difficult
to
obtain
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
drawbacks
associated
with
technology
for
example
it
has
been
linked
to
an
increase
in
mental
health
issues
such
as
anxiety
depression
and
insomnia
additionally
many
of
us
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
on
our
devices
which
leaves
us
with
little
time
for
other
activities
and
relationships
in
conclusion
while
technology
brings
many
benefits
to
our
lives
it
is
also
important
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
risks
we
should
be
mindful
of
how
much
time
we
spend
on
our
devices
and
remember
to
take
time
away
from
them
to
engage
in
meaningful
activities
my
friend
thought
he
was
saving
himself
a
lot
of
time
and
money
by
graduating
a
year
early
from
college
he
finished
his
last
semester
of
classes
speedily
and
was
thrilled
to
be
done
with
school
so
quickly
however
he
started
to
regret
his
decision
soon
after
on
a
personal
level
felt
like
he
had
missed
out
on
the
full
college
experience
socializing
with
his
peers
and
participating
in
activities
were
key
components
of
the
learning
process
giving
him
the
chance
to
grow
as
a
person
without
that
he
felt
somewhat
unfulfilled
and
dissatisfied
from
an
educational
perspective
was
concerned
about
the
skills
he
was
missing
out
on
taking
classes
in
that
final
year
would
have
given
him
the
opportunity
to
hone
his
knowledge
and
acquire
new
skills
in
a
competitive
job
market
that
can
be
the
difference
between
getting
your
dream
job
and
struggling
to
find
work
furthermore
without
the
additional
courses
was
unable
to
advance
his
degree
to
the
next
level
in
the
end
graduating
early
is
n t
always
the
best
option
it
may
seem
like
a
shortcut
at
first
but
the
personal
and
educational
drawbacks
it
brought
my
friend
showed
me
just
how
true
that
is
s
statement
emphasizes
the
importance
of
being
true
to
one
s
self
despite
the
external
pressures
that
society
can
impose
in
the
face
of
conformity
standing
out
can
be
daunting
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
trust
one
s
own
instincts
or
opinions
however
the
struggle
to
remain
true
to
oneself
should
not
be
done
alone
while
it
is
a
personal
journey
having
assistance
and
guidance
from
school
teachers
and
groups
can
be
invaluable
provide
a
place
to
acquire
knowledge
debate
and
learn
about
different
lifestyles
and
cultures
this
can
help
someone
understand
the
different
points
of
view
that
exist
and
have
a
respectful
well rounded
opinion
teachers
are
essential
mentors
who
can
impart
not
only
educational
knowledge
but
also
valuable
advice
and
life
lessons
talking
to
peers
or
joining
a
group
can
provide
a
forum
of
people
who
are
often
living
or
experiencing
similar
issues
sharing
advice
or
personal
stories
can
provide
the
support
and
validation
that
is
required
to
remain
confident
and
sure
of
oneself
in
a
trying
environment
although
being
courageous
and
sure
of
one
s
identity
is
a
personal
accomplishment
having
help
from
school
teachers
and
groups
helps
in
forming
an
independent
and
strong
personality
it
is
important
to
not
only
accept
help
but
to
also
understand
that
no
one
can
manage
on
their
own
having
assistance
is
beneficial
to
remain
true
to
oneself
in
a
world
that
may
strive
to
make
us
something
else
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
classrooms
has
become
an
increasingly
debated
topic
in
recent
years
on
the
one
hand
allowing
students
to
use
their
cell
phones
for
educational
purposes
has
the
potential
to
bring
a
range
of
benefits
for
instance
having
access
to
a
phone
allows
for
quick
and
easy
access
to
digital
resources
such
as
the
internet
allowing
students
to
instantly
gather
valuable
information
it
can
also
help
to
make
learning
an
interactive
and
collaborative
experience
with
students
being
able
to
share
their
progress
and
ideas
without
leaving
their
seat
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
a
number
of
drawbacks
to
allowing
phones
in
the
classroom
perhaps
the
most
obvious
problem
is
the
potential
distraction
that
phones
bring
not
only
can
a
single
student
become
easily
sidetracked
by
a
call
or
notification
but
the
distraction
can
spread
making
classrooms
chaotic
and
unproductive
environments
additionally
smartphone
use
is
associated
with
possible
health
risks
such
as
increased
anxiety
levels
and
reduced
sleep
in
my
opinion
cell
phones
have
a
place
in
the
classroom
and
can
be
a
helpful
tool
in
certain
situations
however
it
is
important
that
students
are
monitored
so
that
things
do
not
become
unruly
therefore
i
believe
it
is
important
to
establish
clear
expectations
and
guidelines
around
how
and
when
phones
can
be
used
in
classrooms
with
proper
guidance
students
can
reap
the
rewards
of
educational
technology
while
not
having
to
worry
about
the
potential
risks
or
problems
that
could
arise
from
their
use
extending
the
school
day
is
a
subject
of
much
debate
with
proponents
citing
increased
productivity
and
improved
learning
outcomes
as
justifications
for
doing
so
however
i
believe
that
there
are
several
strong
and
valid
reasons
why
extending
the
school
day
might
not
be
the
best
solution
to
improving
student
performance
it
is
important
to
consider
whether
students
would
actually
benefit
from
extra
time
in
school
students
school
days
already
include
a
variety
of
subjects
and
activities
such
as
maths
science
humanities
physical
education
extra curricular
activities
and
more
adding
to
an
already
long
school
day
might
not
be
the
best
way
to
improve
learning
outcomes
increasing
the
hours
of
the
school
day
would
ultimately
take
away
from
important
aspects
of
a
student
s
life
that
are
necessary
for
healthy
development
such
as
spending
time
with
family
and
friends
and
engaging
in
hobbies
extending
the
school
day
also
overlooks
the
fact
that
many
students
are
already
overburdened
by
their
schoolwork
adding
extra
hours
to
the
school
day
not
only
puts
more
pressure
on
students
but
it
could
also
lead
to
burnout
or
stress
related
illnesses
in
conclusion
while
extending
the
school
day
could
offer
some
advantages
it
is
not
a
viable
solution
to
improving
student
performance
there
are
other
methods
of
encouraging
better
performance
and
higher
grades
and
these
should
be
considered
before
any
drastic
changes
are
made
after
researching
i
found
that
setting
an
example
by
your
own
behavior
to
influence
other
people
can
be
both
an
advantage
and
a
disadvantage
two
advantages
associated
with
setting
an
example
are
fostering
a
more
obedient
and
disciplined
environment
and
inspiring
others
to
strive
for
the
goals
you
have
achieved
one
main
disadvantage
to
setting
an
example
is
that
others
may
see
you
as
arrogant
creating
tension
and
mistrust
in
conclusion
setting
an
example
has
the
potential
to
be
both
positive
and
negative
so
it
is
important
to
consider
both
sides
before
engaging
in
this
type
of
behavior
technology
impacts
the
lives
of
people
around
the
world
in
countless
ways
both
positive
and
negative
in
positive
terms
technology
can
be
a
lifeline
in
emergency
situations
allowing
those
in
need
to
get
the
help
they
need
quickly
it
can
also
help
to
shape
attitudes
providing
access
to
information
the
average
person
would
not
have
had
in
years
past
on
the
downside
too
much
reliance
on
the
virtual
world
can
create
an
imbalance
in
people
s
lives
causing
them
to
prioritize
spending
time
online
over
spending
time
in
the
physical
world
people
can
become
so
accustomed
to
virtual
connection
that
they
may
struggle
to
form
meaningful
relationships
with
people
in
their
own
community
ultimately
technology
can
be
a
force
for
good
provided
it
is
used
responsibly
and
in
moderation
my
friend
and
i
decided
to
take
on
the
challenge
of
learning
one
of
the
top
hardest
languages
to
learn
vietnamese
from
our
research
we
discovered
that
there
are
numerous
benefits
of
being
able
to
speak
this
language
especially
for
travelers
not
only
would
it
make
it
much
easier
to
communicate
with
the
locals
but
it
would
also
help
to
build
bridges
and
make
meaningful
connections
with
people
around
the
world
when
it
came
to
getting
started
i
took
the
lead
and
taught
my
friend
the
basics
of
the
language
from
pronunciation
to
conjugations
by
breaking
it
down
into
segments
we
were
able
to
cover
a
lot
of
ground
and
eventually
had
a
basic
conversation
in
vietnamese
one
major
benefit
of
speaking
vietnamese
came
into
play
during
my
visit
to
i
had
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
locals
in
their
native
language
something
they
deeply
appreciated
not
only
did
i
gain
knowledge
about
their
culture
and
customs
but
i
was
also
able
to
connect
said
locals
with
potential
customers
broadening
my
business
horizons
in
summary
speaking
has
numerous
benefits
and
can
be
truly
rewarding
not
only
can
it
help
you
when
travelling
in
a
new
country
it
can
also
help
to
foster
meaningful
connections
and
help
enlarge
business
opportunities
it
can
be
challenging
to
learn
the
language
but
it
s
worth
the
effort
there
are
numerous
factors
that
can
influence
an
individual
s
level
of
accomplishment
at
work
these
can
range
from
personal
aptitudes
such
as
aptitude
and
attitude
to
external
forces
like
the
job
market
and
workplace
dynamics
different
individuals
will
have
different
levels
of
success
depending
on
their
individual
skills
and
circumstances
it
is
important
to
consider
that
external
factors
such
as
the
job
market
can
often
be
out
of
the
individual
s
control
yet
still
have
an
impact
on
their
success
different
perspectives
can
also
be
taken
while
overall
outcomes
may
be
influenced
by
factors
beyond
an
individual
s
control
there
are
also
those
factors
which
are
under
an
individual
s
control
and
within
their
power
to
impact
my
conclusion
is
that
it
takes
an
effective
combination
of
factors
in
and
out
of
the
individual
s
control
to
reach
a
high
level
of
success
one
must
actively
strive
to
embrace
and
optimise
the
elements
that
are
in
their
control
while
also
taking
into
account
external
factors
and
their
wider
context
the
debate
over
curfews
for
teenagers
is
a
long standing
one
with
many
pros
and
cons
to
consider
on
the
one
hand
curfews
can
help
keep
teenagers
out
of
trouble
by
enforcing
a
set
time
for
them
to
be
at
home
or
in
safe
places
on
the
other
hand
curfews
can
interfere
with
the
ability
of
young
people
to
participate
in
activities
that
are
important
to
their
development
governing
the
behavior
of
young
people
in
public
vary
from
city
to
city
taking
the
time
to
research
the
laws
in
place
for
your
particular
city
is
essential
to
understanding
what
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
curfews
really
are
from
a
safety
perspective
having
young
people
off
the
streets
after
certain
times
can
help
guard
against
crime
however
allowing
teenagers
more
freedom
may
also
benefit
them
in
terms
of
their
social
and
emotional
development
ultimately
creating
laws
or
policies
around
curfews
for
teenagers
is
a
complex
issue
without
a
single
clear cut
answer
it
s
an
important
topic
to
consider
as
young
people
need
protection
and
guidance
while
also
having
the
opportunity
to
explore
and
grow
in
ways
that
are
appropriate
for
their
age
when
it
comes
to
achieving
goals
the
process
is
no
easy
feat
once
famously
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
to
truly
achieve
success
one
must
be
willing
to
persevere
through
the
difficult
obstacles
that
stand
in
the
way
everyone
s
journey
to
success
shares
a
common
formula
start
with
a
goal
in
mind
brainstorm
a
plan
of
action
find
the
motivation
to
keep
going
and
learn
from
mistakes
along
the
way
every
individual
journey
is
unique
because
goals
come
in
various
shapes
and
sizes
while
some
goals
may
take
days
to
accomplish
others
may
take
years
achievers
must
be
ready
for
long
periods
of
hard
work
and
dedication
as
well
as
the
frequent
curve
balls
that
life
throws
our
way
beyond
facing
our
own
personal
fears
and
challenges
we
must
also
be
prepared
to
encounter
external
hindrances
such
as
limited
resources
financial
constraints
and
the
unexpected
opposition
of
others
learning
to
navigate
these
situations
with
compassion
and
humility
can
be
one
of
the
greatest
lessons
on
the
road
to
success
through
hardship
and
struggle
come
moments
of
triumph
and
reward
after
months
or
even
years
of
hard
work
reaching
our
goals
can
be
one
of
the
most
fulfilling
and
rewarding
experiences
in
such
moments
we
are
often
humbled
by
the
people
who
believed
in
us
supportive
of
us
and
pushed
us
to
remain
on
track
most
of
all
we
take
pride
in
the
idea
that
our
hard
work
has
paid
off
and
our
goals
have
been
accomplished
in
conclusion
no
success
story
is
an
overnight
one
the
process
of
achieving
goals
is
one
that
involves
overcoming
numerous
difficulties
yet
the
rewards
of
success
can
be
deeply
gratifying
and
yield
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
pride
through
this
journey
we
not
only
learn
valuable
lessons
but
also
build
character
and
develop
greater
resilience
for
the
future
work
can
be
an
incredibly
advantageous
method
of
learning
for
students
working
with
others
offers
benefits
that
are
impossible
to
obtain
when
an
individual
works
alone
through
collaboration
between
team
members
students
have
the
potential
to
learn
more
do
better
in
class
and
come
up
with
fresh
and
innovative
ideas
sharing
ideas
is
one
of
the
most
often
cited
advantages
of
working
in
a
group
the
ability
to
brainstorm
and
explore
solutions
as
a
team
can
encourage
students
to
think
more
deeply
than
when
working
on
their
own
work
can
broaden
students
perspectives
as
they
will
be
continuously
interacting
with
their
peers
throughout
the
process
of
completing
a
task
for
example
each
team
member
can
offer
their
own
unique
perspectives
creating
a
constructive
and
inclusive
learning
environment
in
addition
many
studies
have
shown
that
students
who
work
together
are
more
likely
to
learn
the
material
covered
in
a
course
than
those
who
work
independently
a
combination
of
methods
including
student
discussions
small group
activities
and
different
approaches
to
problem
solving
can
help
to
solidify
the
material
being
studied
for
example
one
student
may
be
better
at
math
and
can
now
explain
tough
concepts
to
their
peers
who
are
struggling
working
together
can
also
reduce
the
stress
of
learning
and
allow
students
to
feel
more
comfortable
with
the
topics
by
getting
extra
help
from
their
peers
finally
another
benefit
of
group
work
is
that
it
helps
students
practice
teamwork
and
other
skills
that
are
essential
in
the
real
world
through
collaboration
students
can
develop
valuable
problem solving
and
communication
abilities
that
they
can
use
throughout
their
lives
working
in
a
team
setting
also
encourages
the
development
of
interpersonal
skills
such
as
providing
constructive
feedback
respectfully
challenging
views
and
public
speaking
each
individual
s
contributions
and
efforts
can
then
be
combined
to
produce
more
comprehensive
results
than
otherwise
possible
overall
research
has
shown
that
group
work
has
numerous
advantages
and
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
to
the
learning
process
through
collaboration
students
can
share
ideas
do
better
in
class
and
learn
both
the
material
and
invaluable
skills
from
one
another
work
is
an
essential
element
of
learning
and
provides
students
with
a
unique
opportunity
to
succeed
is
often
defined
as
a
cognitive
orientation
or
response
to
a
person
object
or
situation
in
one
s
environment
it
is
an
extremely
powerful
yet
malleable
force
in
our
lives
that
can
impact
how
we
perceive
and
interact
with
the
world
around
us
in
attitude
is
frequently
synonymous
with
position
indicating
a
mental
disposition
related
to
how
one
feels
or
thinks
about
something
meanwhile
in
spanish
the
concept
of
attitude
is
often
translated
as
actitud
which
suggests
a
much
more
holistic
understanding
of
attitude
encompassing
the
mind
body
and
spirit
in
my
own
life
i
have
experienced
the
negative
effects
of
attitude
firsthand
in
my
professional
life
i
have
worked
with
colleagues
who
have
adopted
a
cynical
attitude
rejecting
ideas
out
of
hand
this
negative
attitude
had
a
negative
impact
on
morale
both
in
my
team
and
in
our
interactions
with
clients
leading
to
conflicts
and
lost
business
it
was
only
when
this
negative
attitude
began
to
shift
to
a
more
positive
orientation
that
our
team
was
able
to
come
together
and
move
forward
inactivity
may
not
seem
like
it
has
much
of
a
purpose
but
engaging
in
activities
and
striving
for
a
goal
can
have
many
benefits
it
can
provide
us
with
a
sense
of
purpose
and
accomplishment
and
allow
us
to
gain
new
skills
and
knowledge
for
example
if
you
are
learning
a
new
language
the
more
actively
engaged
you
are
the
better
your
recall
and
understanding
of
the
language
will
be
working
toward
a
goal
gives
us
focus
motivation
and
a
strong
sense
of
achievement
therefore
it
is
beneficial
to
always
be
doing
something
even
if
it
is
just
taking
small
steps
my
project
topic
is
the
history
of
the
rights
movement
i
plan
to
create
a
timeline
presentation
and
corresponding
paper
outlining
key
historical
events
intertwined
with
personal
research
about
important
figures
in
the
movement
and
their
legacies
i
plan
to
conduct
interviews
with
family
and
friends
to
gain
a
more
personal
insight
into
the
importance
of
the
rights
and
to
highlight
the
collective
experiences
of
people
on
the
ground
i
m
looking
into
primary
sources
including
personal
accounts
from
those
who
experienced
the
movement
as
well
as
other
sources
such
as
books
articles
and
blogs
additionally
i
plan
to
explore
visual
sources
such
as
newspaper
archives
and
documentaries
i
will
also
use
modern
technology
to
look
at
the
current
landscape
of
the
civil
rights
movement
especially
any
changes
that
have
taken
place
since
it
occured
this
will
help
to
provide
a
well rounded
comprehensive
overview
of
the
movement
and
its
effect
on
people
of
color
in
the
states
after
researching
examples
of
successful
group
projects
it
is
clear
that
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
working
in
a
group
instead
of
working
alone
in
a
group
members
are
able
to
share
ideas
work
together
to
solve
problems
and
benefit
from
a
variety
of
perspectives
however
collaborating
with
a
group
can
also
bring
about
problems
like
clashing
opinions
inefficient
decision
making
and
misunderstandings
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
individual
to
weigh
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
and
decide
which
approach
is
best
for
their
situation
whether
it
is
working
with
a
group
or
alone
team
members
must
remain
mindful
of
the
project
goals
clear
communication
and
thoughtful
allocation
of
job
duties
with
these
tips
individuals
can
ensure
success
regardless
of
the
project
s
scope
or
structure
i
can
make
a
contribution
to
my
community
in
a
number
of
ways
i
ve
made
a
list
of
activities
from
easiest
to
hardest
which
i
believe
would
benefit
my
local
community
the
first
on
my
list
would
be
volunteering
at
a
local
food
pantry
helping
to
sort
and
pack
grocery
bags
for
those
in
need
this
is
an
easy
way
to
get
involved
in
improving
the
lives
of
those
around
me
next
i
can
participate
in
neighborhood
clean up
efforts
i
can
donate
my
time
to
help
keep
my
community
clean
and
litter free
other
activities
i
ve
listed
involve
mentoring
youth
in
the
area
or
taking
part
in
a
local
community
garden
by
mentoring
young
people
i
m
contributing
to
the
development
of
future
generations
working
on
the
community
garden
provides
access
to
healthy
fresh
produce
in
food
insecure
areas
to
begin
this
journey
i
m
going
to
research
and
experiment
with
volunteering
at
the
food
pantry
i
want
to
see
what
is
involved
and
what
i
can
bring
to
this
type
of
work
if
the
experience
is
successful
i
will
consider
expanding
my
volunteering
activity
to
a
larger
scale
i
m
hopeful
that
my
efforts
will
positively
impact
people
locally
nationally
and
globally
even
the
smallest
actions
can
create
big
changes
completing
four
years
of
high
school
is
often
seen
as
the
ideal
educational
path
and
is
highly
beneficial
for
students
while
an
extra
year
of
schooling
can
seem
intimidating
it
results
in
a
number
of
educational
personal
and
professional
advantages
those
who
complete
the
four
year
plan
will
find
greater
access
to
more
rigorous
coursework
enabling
meaningful
intellectual
and
personal
growth
with
access
to
a
broader
range
of
classes
students
will
be
able
to
explore
new
interests
while
developing
a
deeper
understanding
of
existing
ones
furthermore
extra
categories
of
electives
and
enriched
curricula
are
often
available
to
those
who
take
an
additional
year
this
allows
students
to
pursue
meaningful
extracurricular
activities
participate
in
valuable
internship
and
volunteer
opportunities
or
even
attempt
to
fulfill
early
college
credit
requirements
though
an
extra
year
of
school
may
mean
a
later
start
to
college
the
benefits
far
outweigh
the
drawbacks
students
will
be
better
equipped
for
college level
work
making
them
more
likely
to
succeed
in
their
academic
pursuits
additionally
having
extra
time
to
refine
both
their
skills
and
interests
can
result
in
more
competitive
applications
in
contrast
to
the
four
year
plan
opting
for
three
years
of
high
school
does
have
its
benefits
most
notably
students
who
graduate
early
may
have
the
opportunity
to
enter
college
with
a
head
start
allowing
them
to
adjust
quickly
to
college
life
and
possibly
graduate
early
ultimately
the
best
course
for
each
student
is
dependent
on
individual
considerations
and
should
be
approached
with
due
diligence
taking
the
extra
year
of
high
school
can
have
invaluable
benefits
potentially
providing
immersive
learning
experiences
to
open
doors
for
brighter
futures
in
today
s
increasingly
competitive
job
market
it
is
important
for
students
to
commit
to
a
career
path
at
a
young
age
one
way
to
do
this
is
to
take
advantage
of
the
resources
offered
by
schools
like
the
help
of
teachers
and
access
to
career
counselors
by
starting
to
research
and
think
about
a
career
path
early
on
in
life
students
can
save
themselves
money
and
time
in
the
long
run
furthermore
commitment
to
a
career
can
help
create
a
sense
of
independence
allowing
students
to
make
crucial
decisions
for
their
own
future
however
sometimes
family
external
pressures
or
even
fear
of
failure
can
impede
a
student
from
pursuing
their
dreams
it
is
important
for
students
to
remember
that
their
career
path
should
not
be
dictated
by
anyone
else
and
that
personal
ambition
is
a
virtue
even
if
the
odds
may
be
stacked
against
them
students
should
find
the
courage
to
follow
their
passions
and
use
the
resources
available
to
them
to
turn
their
dreams
into
reality
technology
has
changed
the
way
humans
interact
with
one
another
on
a
daily
basis
on
the
positive
side
technology
has
made
it
easier
than
ever
to
stay
connected
with
friends
family
and
colleagues
no
matter
where
they
are
in
the
world
for
example
video
chat
and
social
media
allows
us
to
see
and
interact
with
people
from
anywhere
enabling
us
to
stay
in
contact
without
the
need
for
long distance
travel
additionally
technology
has
made
it
easier
to
find
community
and
like minded
people
even
if
we
do
n t
live
in
the
same
area
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
also
have
a
negative
impact
on
human
interaction
distractions
such
as
mobile
phones
and
social
media
can
often
take
away
from
our
real life
interactions
making
us
less
present
in
the
moment
additionally
when
having
conversations
online
or
through
text
messaging
it
can
be
difficult
to
convey
emotions
or
understand
the
nuances
of
a
conversation
leading
to
misunderstandings
or
arguments
overall
technology
can
create
both
good
and
bad
outcomes
when
it
comes
to
human
interaction
it
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
bringing
people
together
while
also
presenting
potential
pitfalls
if
used
in
the
wrong
way
to
ensure
a
positive
outcome
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
how
we
use
technology
and
strike
a
balance
between
digital
and
real life
interactions
proponents
of
allowing
students
to
bring
their
phones
to
school
argue
that
phones
offer
a
number
of
educational
benefits
such
as
access
to
educational
apps
online
resources
and
digital
work
collaboration
in
addition
the
use
of
phones
in
school
can
act
as
a
safety
measure
as
having
a
phone
on
them
gives
students
the
ability
to
easily
contact
parents
and
guardians
in
case
of
an
emergency
on
the
other
hand
there
are
certain
drawbacks
to
allowing
students
to
use
their
phones
in
school
it
can
be
a
major
distraction
for
students
detracting
from
their
focus
on
academics
it
may
also
lead
to
potential
cyberbullying
in
school
as
well
as
encourage
cheating
furthermore
it
is
possible
that
allowing
phones
in
school
unfairly
gives
an
advantage
to
students
who
can
afford
the
latest
technology
potentially
creating
a
digital
divide
technology
has
transformed
how
we
interact
and
relate
to
each
other
over
the
years
it
has
revolutionized
communication
in
unparalleled
ways
allowing
us
to
stay
connected
no
matter
the
distance
on
the
surface
the
ability
to
send
a
message
across
the
world
in
a
matter
of
seconds
seems
like
a
positive
development
as
it
makes
it
easier
than
ever
to
stay
in
touch
with
friends
and
family
however
technology
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
relationships
people
spend
too
much
time
in
front
of
their
screens
and
forget
to
appreciate
the
people
around
them
social
media
in
particular
has
created
a
false
sense
of
real
communication
as
virtual
conversations
can
never
truly
replace
face to face
interaction
in
addition
technology
has
led
to
a
sense
of
disconnect
as
people
can
be
geographically
close
but
emotionally
far
away
a
phenomenon
which
would
not
exist
without
technology
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
positives
to
be
found
in
the
role
technology
plays
in
our
relationships
we
can
easily
communicate
with
those
who
are
far
away
and
share
memories
with
them
in
addition
websites
such
as
and
make
it
possible
to
visit
each
other
without
having
to
be
physically
present
furthermore
technology
enables
us
to
stay
connected
to
our
loved
ones
constantly
throughout
the
day
without
technology
relationships
would
be
much
different
we
would
rely
more
heavily
on
face to face
interaction
as
well
as
communication
methods
such
as
letters
it
would
take
much
longer
to
hear
from
those
we
care
about
and
there
would
be
a
much
greater
reliance
on
physical
activities
such
as
visiting
and
spending
time
together
in
person
to
stay
connected
ultimately
without
technology
interpersonal
relationships
would
become
much
more
difficult
to
maintain
days
are
already
long
and
that
is
why
the
school
board
should
not
add
an
extra
one
and
a
half
hours
to
each
one
not
only
are
students
already
overworked
but
longer
school
days
could
have
an
overall
negative
effect
on
their
wellbeing
firstly
students
have
their
own
lives
outside
of
school
longer
school
days
would
give
them
less
time
to
relax
or
pursue
their
own
personal
interests
this
could
lead
to
burnout
and
cause
them
to
resent
their
studies
even
more
than
they
may
already
secondly
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
time
spent
at
school
would
reduce
the
amount
of
physical
activities
students
are
able
to
participate
in
and
physical
health
are
both
important
and
longer
days
could
lead
to
students
developing
an
unbalanced
lifestyle
which
could
potentially
have
serious
consequences
lastly
having
longer
school
days
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
homework
assigned
teachers
would
end
up
assigning
more
so
that
students
can
keep
up
with
the
contents
covered
in
school
but
this
would
further
overburden
students
and
leave
less
time
for
family
and
personal
leisure
time
in
conclusion
the
school
board
should
not
add
one
and
a
half
hours
to
each
school
day
not
only
would
it
be
detrimental
to
students
mental
and
physical
health
but
it
would
also
reduce
the
amount
of
free
time
they
have
to
do
other
activities
leading
to
an
overall
decrease
in
their
quality
of
life
it
is
essential
that
students
have
adequate
time
to
pursue
activities
that
they
enjoy
and
relax
in
recent
years
the
need
for
a
shift
towards
healthier
food
options
in
schools
has
been
made
clear
studies
show
that
healthier
lunch
menus
have
the
potential
to
improve
students
diets
security
and
lifestyles
leading
to
significant
improvements
in
their
lives
for
example
raising
awareness
around
healthier
dietary
options
in
students
can
instill
healthy
habits
that
could
help
prevent
chronic
health
issues
throughout
their
lifetime
studies
also
suggest
that
when
students
are
provided
with
healthier
meals
they
are
more
likely
to
attend
school
which
could
lead
to
better
academic
outcomes
and
improved
student
well being
furthermore
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
healthier
lunch
menus
can
provide
students
with
better
economic
security
by
encouraging
them
to
purchase
healthier
options
rather
than
relying
on
pre packaged
processed
meals
the
change
to
more
nutritious
lunches
in
schools
has
the
potential
to
have
numerous
benefits
for
students
it
is
clear
that
making
such
a
shift
to
healthier
options
would
be
beneficial
and
with
the
right
policies
and
commitment
the
positive
effects
could
be
achieved
graduating
high
school
in
four
years
is
an
option
that
can
bring
many
positives
to
a
student
s
life
firstly
it
frees
up
time
in
the
student
s
life
for
personal
activities
and
goals
such
as
college
visits
extracurricular
activities
internships
and
service
projects
secondly
taking
four
years
to
complete
high
school
also
gives
students
extra
time
to
take
elective
courses
that
may
not
be
available
in
three year
plans
this
can
give
students
a
more
well rounded
education
and
the
opportunity
to
discover
their
passions
additionally
by
taking
the
extra
year
a
student
may
feel
more
prepared
for
post secondary
education
and
they
ll
have
had
more
time
to
strengthen
their
study
habits
lastly
a
four year
plan
can
help
maintain
the
quality
of
education
and
allow
teachers
more
time
for
preparing
and
teaching
their
courses
taking
four
years
to
complete
high
school
can
bring
many
benefits
and
should
be
considered
a
viable
option
having
multiple
opinions
can
be
beneficial
when
making
a
choice
hearing
different
perspectives
can
make
it
easier
to
consider
all
of
the
pros
and
cons
listening
to
others
can
provide
insight
into
both
why
a
choice
should
be
made
and
why
it
should
be
avoided
it
can
also
prompt
creative
solutions
for
the
issue
at
hand
additionally
advice
from
close
friends
or
family
can
be
a
huge
help
in
making
decisions
they
are
likely
to
be
more
informed
about
the
situation
and
can
provide
a
unique
perspective
for
these
reasons
getting
input
from
multiple
sources
can
be
a
great
way
to
make
a
better
decision
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
an
essential
part
of
life
and
can
profoundly
impact
a
person
s
success
and
growth
when
individuals
take
initiative
and
make
their
own
decisions
they
gain
confidence
and
develop
their
critical
thinking
skills
they
also
learn
to
live
with
the
results
of
their
choices
both
good
and
bad
without
relying
on
others
to
make
decisions
for
them
making
one
s
own
decisions
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
for
example
if
someone
is
considering
a
job
opportunity
they
should
be
able
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
pursue
it
on
their
own
instead
of
someone
else
making
the
decision
for
them
taking
ownership
of
making
their
own
decisions
can
allow
a
person
to
take
calculated
risks
and
be
open
to
new
experiences
that
they
may
otherwise
have
not
considered
additionally
they
are
able
to
gain
an
understanding
of
what
makes
them
happy
distinguishing
between
what
brings
them
joy
and
what
other
people
may
want
them
to
pursue
on
the
other
hand
not
making
one
s
own
decisions
can
lead
to
several
adverse
outcomes
in
some
cases
a
person
may
choose
to
rely
on
someone
else
s
opinion
and
wind
up
feeling
regret
or
disappointment
with
the
outcome
additionally
when
people
do
n t
take
ownership
of
making
choices
for
themselves
they
can
miss
out
on
opportunities
life
lessons
and
valuable
experiences
in
conclusion
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
essential
for
an
individual
s
personal
growth
and
success
it
allows
people
to
gain
confidence
build
problem solving
skills
and
gain
an
understanding
of
what
makes
them
content
ultimately
making
one
s
own
decisions
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
a
person
s
life
in
many
ways
so
it
is
important
they
take
ownership
of
their
own
decisions
many
people
believe
that
having
a
positive
attitude
is
the
key
to
life
and
will
allow
them
to
make
it
through
any
tough
situation
without
any
difficulty
however
this
idea
simply
is
n t
true
throws
curveballs
at
us
all
the
time whether
it
be
a
nasty
breakup
the
death
of
a
loved
one
or
coming
face to face
with
a
person
who
does
not
share
our
morality
a
positive
attitude
will
not
alleviate
these
challenges
instead
one
must
face
them
head on
in
order
to
move
past
them
we
can
choose
to
think
positively
in
these
life altering
situations
sure
but
no
amount
of
optimism
will
erase
the
fact
that
these
events
are
difficult
and
will
take
immense
strength
and
resilience
to
push
through
it
s
unrealistic
to
think
we
can
simply
float
through
life
without
going
through
any
hardship
by
having
a
positive
attitude
alone
it
s
not
wrong
to
view
life
through
a
positive
lens
but
we
can
not
solely
rely
on
this
kind
of
comedic
realism
when
reality
is
sometimes
anything
but
funny
has
its
ups
and
downs
and
having
a
positive
attitude
wo
n t
make
these
times
disappear
instead
we
must
confront
these
moments
and
hardships
and
strive
to
grow
from
them
technology
has
had
an
immense
and
profoundly
positive
effect
on
our
day
to
day
lives
advances
in
communication
technology
such
as
the
telephone
have
revolutionized
the
way
we
connect
with
and
communicate
to
each
other
in
patented
the
first
electrical
telephone
providing
us
with
the
capacity
for
instantaneous
communication
over
long
distances
nowadays
with
a
variety
of
devices
and
applications
we
can
stay
virtually
connected
to
family
friends
colleagues
and
the
wider
world
regardless
of
distance
technology
has
also
revolutionized
the
field
of
transportation
trains
planes
and
automobiles
have
enabled
more
efficient
and
time saving
journeys
additionally
technology
has
made
higher
education
more
accessible
providing
the
tools
to
study
remotely
through
the
internet
various
applications
and
programs
also
help
us
to
make
decisions
quickly
and
watch
out
trends
in
the
market
thus
greatly
improving
efficiency
finally
technology
has
allowed
us
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
home office
mixing
family
life
with
work
life
and
bringing
all
professional
resources
to
the
comfort
of
our
home
all
in
all
technology
has
revolutionized
our
lives
changing
the
way
we
work
study
travel
and
stay
connected
adopting
a
p m
weekday
and
midnight
weekend
curfew
for
teenagers
is
a
somewhat
divisive
issue
as
it
has
both
positive
and
negative
implications
on
the
positive
side
after hours
access
to
teenage
hotspots
would
be
restricted
and
fewer
late night
incidents
involving
minors
would
be
reported
research
suggests
that
teenagers
brains
may
be
wired
to
operate
better
when
they
receive
sufficient
amounts
of
sleep
with
a
p m
curfew
concerned
guardians
can
be
more
relaxed
about
knowing
that
their
children
are
getting
enough
rest
and
are
safe
at
home
on
the
other
hand
implementing
a
curfew
could
be
perceived
as
the
city
council
being
overbearing
and
intrusive
to
the
lives
of
minors
violating
their
freedoms
and
liberties
furthermore
the
enforcement
of
this
curfew
may
be
difficult
and
costly
teenagers
could
also
be
discouraged
from
engaging
in
extracurricular
activities
and
after school
programs
that
might
satisfy
their
educational
and or
creative
needs
since
these
activities
often
run
past
p m
even
worse
the
curfew
may
be
seen
as
an
invitation
for
teenagers
to
break
the
law
thus
leading
to
further
crime
and
legal
issues
overall
it
is
important
to
weigh
the
positives
and
negatives
of
imposing
a
citywide
curfew
for
minors
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
its
adoption
gathering
multiple
opinions
before
making
a
decision
is
a
valuable
practice
that
can
be
of
great
benefit
for
a
variety
of
reasons
asking
different
people
for
their
thoughts
and
beliefs
will
not
only
give
you
a
wider
range
of
perspectives
it
can
also
help
to
build
relationships
and
encourage
communication
between
them
for
instance
when
considering
major
life
decisions
such
as
which
college
to
attend
or
which
career
path
to
pursue
one
should
consider
talking
to
not
only
family
and
friends
but
to
counselors
mentors
and
teachers
it
s
important
to
do
research
and
gather
as
much
information
as
possible
by
looking
at
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
option
in
order
to
make
the
best
choice
for
yourself
similarly
when
forming
business
plans
or
deciding
on
investments
it
is
beneficial
to
get
input
from
professional
colleagues
such
as
accountants
attorneys
or
financial
advisors
in
addition
to
opinions
from
family
and
friends
attorneys
who
are
knowledgeable
in
the
field
can
provide
useful
information
on
the
legal
implications
of
the
decision
while
financial
advisors
can
advise
whether
or
not
a
certain
investment
is
a
wise
choice
in
addition
obtaining
different
opinions
from
those
in
the
industry
or
who
are
knowledgeable
in
the
matter
being
decided
on
will
give
an
even
broader
perspective
for
example
when
deciding
which
type
of
marketing
to
employ
opinions
from
marketing
experts
may
be
beneficial
as
well
as
getting
input
from
those
with
experience
in
the
company
gathering
multiple
perspectives
before
making
a
major
decision
is
key
to
making
the
right
choice
and
can
lead
to
the
best
outcome
for
everyone
involved
it
provides
variety
of
thoughts
and
possible
insight
that
can
be
incredibly
valuable
when
making
a
decision
after
researching
chorus
classes
offered
at
local
schools
i
decided
to
join
the
chorus
class
at
my
nearby
high
school
i
attended
regular
practice
sessions
and
paid
attention
to
other
students

gain
insight
into
new
techniques
and
strategies
for
singing
whenever
i
needed
help
i
asked
my
teacher
or
other
students
in
the
class
for
help
and
advice
practicing
singing
songs
on
my
own
was
critical
in
helping
me
improve
my
singing
skills
i
also
worked
hard
to
learn
the
lyrics
of
the
chorus
songs
we
were
singing
once
i
felt
comfortable
with
the
music
i
was
ready
to
perform
in

of
an
audience
s
story
has
become
a
cautionary
tale
demonstrating
the
importance
of
seeking
out
advice
from
experts
when
making
big
decisions
in
life
when
he
set
out
on
his
fateful
journey
to
foolishly
ignored
any
advice
he
received
from
those
wiser
and
more
experienced
than
he
s
lack
of
guidance
contributed
to
his
eventual
demise
seeking
advice
from
experts
is
essential
when
making
life changing
decisions
this
advice
provides
us
with
mentors
who
can
offer
wisdom
and
insight
and
support
sound
decision making
experts
can
provide
a
greater
understanding
of
how
each
choice
can
affect
our
lives
and
can
help
steer
us
towards
paths
that
are
more
likely
to
be
successful
advice
can
also
provide
much
needed
encouragement
and
objectivity
when
making
difficult
choices
extracurricular
activities
provide
students
with
invaluable
opportunities
to
get
involved
in
an
array
of
activities
from
sports
and
the
arts
to
community
service
and
student
government
for
many
students
taking
part
in
these
activities
is
a
major
part
of
their
school
life
and
a
route
to
personal
growth
therefore
the
question
of
whether
or
not
schools
should
control
how
many
activities
a
student
participates
in
deserves
serious
consideration
when
examining
this
issue
it
s
important
to
consider
the
roles
of
the
student
family
and
school
in
deciding
upon
a
student
s
involvement
in
extracurriculars
the
student
is
ultimately
the
one
engaging
in
the
activities
and
should
have
the
opportunity
to
try
a
variety
of
activities
to
find
where
their
passions
and
interests
lie
the
family
should
provide
support
and
guidance
to
the
student
to
ensure
they
don
t
over commit
themselves
or
become
too
overwhelmed
as
for
the
school
its
responsibility
is
to
create
a
school
environment
that
provides
students
with
access
to
a
balanced
range
of
extracurricular
activities
that
promote
growth
and
exploration
the
school
may
however
need
to
intervene
in
certain
scenarios
in
order
to
protect
a
student
s
welfare
for
example
if
a
student
has
reached
a
high
level
of
success
in
an
activity
and
is
being
pushed
by
a
parent
or
coach
to
continue
working
at
an
unhealthy
level
the
school
should
be
ready
to
step
in
and
provide
guidance
and
support
similarly
if
a
student
is
participating
in
too
many
activities
and
it
is
beginning
to
affect
their
health
or
academic
performance
then
the
school
should
assess
the
situation
and
intervene
when
appropriate
in
conclusion
when
it
comes
to
students
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
schools
should
play
a
role
in
measuring
and
assessing
how
many
activities
a
student
engages
in
by
considering
the
emotive
physical
and
psychological
state
of
the
student
together
with
the
input
of
parents
and
coaches
schools
can
create
a
supportive
environment
which
allows
students
to
thrive
in
their
extracurriculars
while
ensuring
their
safety
and
well being
after
completing
my
research
i
have
learned
some
key
lessons
for
securing
a
successful
second
impression
in
professional
interviews
and
meetings
it
is
important
to
dress
professionally
in
a
manner
that
is
appropriate
to
the
environment
furthermore
good
manners
are
essential
to
making
a
good
impression
on
people
it
is
important
to
arrive
early
to
events
and
meetings
to
show
that
you
are
reliable
to
ensure
a
successful
second
impression
in
my
next
professional
interview
or
meeting
i
have
created
a
plan
that
incorporates
all
of
the
key
lessons
i
have
learned
i
will
dress
professionally
and
appropriate
to
the
setting
and
i
will
arrive
minutes
ahead
of
the
scheduled
start
time
i
will
also
be
conscious
of
my
manners
displaying
courtesy
and
respect
to
all
people
i
interact
with
by
following
this
plan
i
am
confident
that
i
will
make
a
good
second
impression
during
the
morning
arrived
in
the
office
with
a
positive
attitude
and
greeted
his
coworkers
with
enthusiasm
he
was
eager
to
get
started
on
the
morning
tasks
and
was
helpful
even
when
he
did
n t
need
to
be
in
the
afternoon
however
had
quite
a
different
attitude
he
was
grumpy
and
slow
to
complete
his
tasks
often
offering
up
excuses
for
why
he
was
n t
doing
his
job
efficiently
the
stark
contrast
in
s
attitude
between
the
morning
and
afternoon
starkly
demonstrates
how
one
s
attitude
can
make
a
difference
in
how
tasks
are
completed
and
how
quickly
influencing
others
is
an
important
and
powerful
skill
that
can
help
shape
the
world
we
live
in
today
and
the
future
of
generations
to
come
having
the
ability
to
guide
influence
and
share
thoughts
is
an
invaluable
part
of
living
and
interacting
with
others
there
are
three
main
reasons
why
having
the
power
to
influence
is
important
firstly
it
can
help
people
make
better
decisions
since
being
exposed
to
a
variety
of
perspectives
and
opinions
helps
broaden
one
s
knowledge
and
understanding
of
a
certain
situation
secondly
it
can
help
individuals
become
more
active
and
successful
members
of
society
having
the
ability
to
take
initiative
can
inspire
others
around
them
and
form
meaningful
connections
and
lastly
it
can
help
shape
the
future
of
others
and
their
children
by
sharing
knowledge
insight
and
experiences
allowing
them
to
draw
on
these
to
make
more
informed
decisions
having
the
ability
to
influence
others
is
an
essential
part
of
living
whether
it
s
guiding
and
advising
friends
and
family
or
organizing
a
group
discussion
to
come
to
a
mutual
understanding
these
skills
can
help
us
make
better
decisions
help
us
become
successful
members
of
society
and
create
the
foundation
for
future
generations
it
was
a
decision
i
had
to
make
for
myself
stay
with
people
i
had
known
for
years
or
chart
a
new
path
alone
i
decided
to
take
the
risk
and
walk
away
despite
the
potential
criticism
that
was
to
come
i
did
n t
want
to
be
part
of
a
group
of
people
that
was
asking
me
to
do
things
that
i
wasn
t
comfortable
with
the
thought
came
to
me
that
perhaps
not
everyone
has
my
best
interest
at
heart
it
became
clear
to
me
that
some
people my
former
friends were
more
concerned
with
themselves
than
my
success
or
goals
i
felt
brave
and
resolute
in
my
decision
to
stand
alone
and
i
m
proud
that
i
was
it
may
be
difficult
to
stand
alone
in
this
world
but
it
can
be
done
and
is
ultimately
better
than
being
with
people
who
could
negatively
influence
you
showing
kindness
to
others
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
our
lives
and
the
community
growing
up
i
was
surrounded
by
people
who
believed
that
a
simple
act
of
kindness
could
change
someone
s
day
and
bring
happiness
to
them
whether
it
was
lending
a
helping
hand
to
someone
in
need
or
volunteering
at
a
homeless
shelter
i
saw
that
being
kind
to
others
could
make
a
positive
difference
i
also
experienced
this
positive
effect
firsthand
one
instance
was
when
i
offered
to
tutor
a
classmate
who
was
having
difficulty
in
a
course
through
our
tutoring
sessions
not
only
did
my
classmate
s
grades
improve
but
i
also
had
the
chance
to
build
a
meaningful
connection
with
them
even
small
acts
of
kindness
can
make
a
big
difference
in
people
s
lives
in
addition
kind
deeds
can
have
a
positive
influence
on
the
community
communities
where
people
take
the
time
to
care
for
those
around
them
can
be
more
welcoming
and
create
a
sense
of
belonging
it
s
no
surprise
that
the
more
people
commit
to
random
acts
of
kindness
the
more
people
benefit
from
it
to
conclude
it
s
clear
that
kindness
is
an
important
virtue
that
contributes
to
happiness
and
enriching
the
community
we
should
never
underestimate
the
power
of
kindness
and
continue
showing
it
to
those
around
us
having
good
behavior
at
school
and
in
other
places
starts
with
the
people
around
us
we
can
all
be
compassionate
friends
and
influence
each
other
whether
it
s
positive
or
negative
when
people
have
good
influences
in
their
lives
they
can
look
up
to
or
be
inspired
by
those
people
and
this
often
leads
to
better
behavior
however
when
people
have
bad
influences
in
their
lives
it
can
be
easy
to
get
caught
in
a
negative
cycle
of
activities
or
attitudes
when
people
have
a
bad
life
it
can
result
in
negative
behavior
this
could
be
from
something
like
poverty
and
lack
of
necessary
resources
at
home
or
from
issues
in
the
family
dynamic
parents
often
play
a
major
role
in
shaping
how
we
behave
and
act
in
the
world
around
us
in
situations
where
parents
are
a
negative
influence
it
can
be
essential
to
have
true
friends
who
can
provide
good
influences
and
be
sources
of
positivity
and
stability
by
being
a
compassionate
friend
we
can
help
those
who
may
be
struggling
with
behavior
issues
we
need
to
assess
why
people
are
behaving
in
certain
ways
and
offer
solutions
or
advice
that
can
help
guide
them
showing
them
that
we
care
and
that
there
is
a
better
way
through
being
a
good
influence
we
can
have
the
power
to
really
make
a
difference
in
people
s
lives
praise
is
an
important
tool
that
we
can
use
to
express
gratitude
and
admiration
for
someone
s
work
or
accomplishments
praise
can
be
used
to
acknowledge
someone
s
efforts
and
show
appreciation
for
a
job
well
done
furthermore
it
can
be
a
powerful
tool
in
boosting
someone
s
self esteem
when
children
receive
praise
for
their
accomplishments
in
school
they
can
gain
confidence
and
become
motivated
to
push
themselves
further
and
continue
to
strive
for
excellence
similarly
someone
s
hard
work
and
dedication
at
their
job
can
encourage
positive
reinforcement
through
praise
leading
to
improved
morale
and
productivity
finally
praise
can
be
used
to
show
support
and
appreciation
in
our
everyday
lives
talking
positively
about
someone
or
recognizing
their
strengths
let
them
know
that
they
are
valued
and
appreciated
by
using
praise
in
a
positive
and
helpful
way
we
can
create
a
kinder
and
more
compassionate
community
and
society
overcoming
negative
mindsets
is
a
critical
goal
for
us
to
achieve
helps
people
to
build
more
resilience
increased
self confidence
and
a
sense
of
purpose
lets
people
know
that
they
are
seen
heard
and
appreciated
offering
a
sense
of
hope
in
dark
times
it
helps
to
create
connections
and
foster
a
sense
of
empathy
and
understanding
between
people
through
praise
we
can
make
the
world
a
better
place
teaching
children
proper
table
manners
is
an
important
life
skill
that
can
help
them
feel
at
ease
during
meals
build
self confidence
in
various
social
settings
and
make
a
good
impression
those
that
have
n t
been
taught
proper
table
manners
as
children
can
feel
awkward
or
uncomfortable
during
mealtimes
with
people
of
their
same
age
as
well
as
in
other
social
situations
moreover
adults
who
grew
up
without
etiquette
lessons
may
struggle
to
feel
self confident
in
certain
social
settings
therefore
it
is
important
to
research
and
identify
ways
to
encourage
kids
to
behave
during
meals
and
instill
good
manners
in
them
from
an
early
age
this
can
include
setting
expectations
for
mealtime
respect
setting
rules
around
rude
words
or
language
modeling
behaviors
implementing
rewards
and
consequences
and
providing
positive
reinforcement
by
doing
this
children
can
develop
a
sense
of
respect
for
mealtime
behavior
and
mature
into
well
mannered
adults
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
has
its
pros
and
cons
working
in
a
group
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
such
as
encouraging
collaboration
providing
different
perspectives
and
improving
problem solving
skills
collaboration
can
be
a
great
experience
as
it
encourages
compromise
and
provides
another
layer
of
understanding
working
in
a
group
can
also
stimulate
the
open
exchange
of
ideas
among
members
of
the
group
resulting
in
different
perspectives
from
which
to
consider
a
solution
to
a
problem
additionally
multiple
minds
working
on
the
same
challenge
can
improve
problem solving
skills
and
can
create
a
better
work
product
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
can
be
difficult
because
of
the
lack
of
collaboration
the
stagnant
ideas
and
the
pressure
to
work
at
a
faster
pace
when
working
alone
there
is
no
one
to
bounce
ideas
off
of
leading
to
stagnant
ideas
as
no
new
perspectives
are
introduced
moreover
when
working
alone
the
individual
is
expected
to
work
at
a
faster
pace
and
can
result
in
rushed
work
product
working
in
a
group
can
be
especially
helpful
to
students
working
in
a
group
can
alleviate
some
of
the
pressures
associated
with
an
academic
project
such
as
the
fear
of
being
the
only
one
who
does
not
understand
the
material
or
the
fear
of
not
completing
the
assignment
on
time
additionally
working
in
a
group
can
also
promote
sharing
of
resources
and
responsibility
as
group
members
can
share
the
workload
and
knowledge
settings
also
bring
opportunities
to
ask
for
help
learn
and
build
relationships
when
considering
the
importance
of
knowledge
and
imagination
in
our
day to day
lives
it
becomes
clear
that
both
are
essential
for
success
in
both
individual
and
collective
endeavours
the
application
of
knowledge
such
as
scientific
facts
and
figures
an
understanding
of
history
and
culture
and
awareness
of
technical
skills
can
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
decision making
for
example
as
part
of
a
successful
team
the
knowledge
gained
in
formal
education
can
be
beneficial
in
terms
of
brainstorming
methods
and
strategies
for
solving
problems
but
knowledge
alone
is
not
enough
to
drive
progress
and
success
often
it
is
the
ability
to
imagine
solutions
that
can
be
the
difference
between
failure
and
success
is
perhaps
best
understood
as
the
ability
to
think
creatively
and
to
think
outside
the
box
in
order
to
be
truly
successful
the
two
must
work
together
knowledge
must
inform
imagination
and
imagination
must
inform
knowledge
for
instance
imagining
new
and
innovative
ideas
to
drive
a
successful
business
is
only
possible
when
one
has
the
appropriate
knowledge
knowledge
of
the
relevant
legislation
of
best
practices
and
of
the
industry
to
summarise
imagination
and
knowledge
are
both
essential
for
success
in
life
and
in
teamwork
provides
the
structure
and
boundaries
for
our
actions
whilst
imagination
can
help
to
push
boundaries
and
create
something
new
when
used
in
combination
the
results
can
be
remarkable
and
far reaching
became
an
icon
of
the
civil
rights
movement
for
her
determined
stand
against
racial
discrimination
a
seamstress
from
was
arrested
in
for
refusing
to
give
up
her
bus
seat
to
a
white
passenger
in
response
to
her
arrest
members
of
the
african
community
in
initiated
a
boycott
of
the
city
s
bus
system
this
boycott
helped
catalyze
national
efforts
to
end
racial
segregation
the
motivating
force
behind
s
actions
was
her
strong
work
ethic
and
enduring
commitment
to
justice
as
said
i
like
the
dreams
of
the
future
better
than
the
history
of
the
past
recognized
the
potential
of
a
future
where
everyone
was
treated
equally
and
she
was
determined
to
achieve
that
vision
is
like
a
tree
and
reputation
is
like
its
shadow
said
s
commitment
to
her
beliefs
ensured
her
place
in
history
ultimately
s
courageous
stand
demonstrated
the
potential
of
a
determined
work
ethic
to
bring
about
positive
change
one
of
the
most
controversial
topics
to
discuss
in
the
education
system
is
the
degree
to
which
schools
should
control
the
involvement
of
extracurricular
activities
the
pros
and
cons
of
having
schools
control
every
aspect
of
extracurricular
activities
must
be
considered
on
the
one
hand
there
are
significant
benefits
to
having
schools
set
strict
regulations
and
enforce
strict
guidelines
through
this
schools
can
provide
students
with
a
safe
and
secure
environment
in
which
to
explore
and
engage
in
new
activities
moreover
it
ensures
that
the
activities
offered
are
of
the
highest
quality
allowing
students
to
really
get
the
most
out
of
their
experience
on
the
other
hand
overly
controlling
the
extracurricular
activities
available
to
students
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
students
by
limiting
the
opportunities
available
to
students
schools
may
limit
student
creativity
and
exploration
students
may
be
discouraged
from
pursuing
activities
that
may
not
be
officially
recognized
by
the
school
but
that
could
still
have
an
enormous
benefit
to
them
additionally
students
may
become
frustrated
by
the
unnecessary
restrictions
imposed
on
them
which
could
lead
to
a
lower
sense
of
self confidence
or
a
decrease
in
academic
performance
overall
it
is
important
for
schools
to
carefully
consider
their
approach
to
extracurricular
activities
as
there
are
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
having
a
high
level
of
control
over
what
is
offered
to
students
ultimately
a
balance
must
be
struck
between
providing
students
with
a
safe
and
secure
environment
and
giving
them
the
freedom
to
explore
and
create
by
doing
this
the
educational
experience
of
each
student
can
be
enriched
and
improved
i
recently
had
an
experience
that
taught
me
a
lot
about
the
power
of
first
impressions
and
how
difficult
they
can
be
to
change
i
made
a
video
to
promote
my
business
and
posted
it
online
i
was
surprised
when
i
received
an
invitation
from
a
fancy
restaurant
to
be
their
newest
guest
i
was
nervous
and
was
n t
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
put
on
my
best
outfit
and
went
anyway
to
my
surprise
the
restaurant
staff
welcomed
me
with
open
arms
and
thanked
me
for
my
video
they
were
so
positive
and
enthusiastic
that
it
changed
my
first
impression
of
the
restaurant
and
gave
me
a
newfound
appreciation
for
the
establishment
in
today
s
world
many
students
recognize
the
pressing
importance
of
getting
involved
in
their
local
community
to
make
a
meaningful
and
lasting
difference
for
current
and
future
generations
they
can
positively
contribute
to
the
world
in
many
ways
from
picking
up
litter
to
helping
those
in
need
saving
endangered
animals
and
preventing
the
greenhouse
effect
one
way
students
can
help
positively
change
their
local
community
is
by
taking
part
in
public
service
projects
such
as
cleaning
up
a
street
or
park
or
organizing
a
charity
auction
they
can
also
take
part
in
initiatives
that
directly
help
people
who
are
in
need
for
example
students
can
assist
at
a
food
bank
donate
clothing
to
homeless
shelters
or
volunteer
at
a
homeless
shelter
these
projects
demonstrate
how
students
can
make
a
difference
in
their
surrounding
environment
while
helping
those
who
are
struggling
in
addition
to
public
service
projects
students
can
take
action
to
save
endangered
animals
by
advocating
for
humane
treatment
preserving
habitats
and
promoting
awareness
moreover
by
conserving
energy
students
can
help
prevent
the
damaging
effects
of
the
greenhouse
effect
and
make
a
positive
difference
in
the
world
efficiency
measures
help
reduce
the
amount
of
energy
resources
consumed
reduce
energy
costs
and
reduce
the
amount
of
pollutants
that
are
released
into
the
environment
by
taking
at
least
some
of
these
steps
students
can
use
their
energy
efficiently
to
power
up
the
world
overall
students
can
help
their
community
and
the
world
through
a
variety
of
methods
including
taking
part
in
service
projects
helping
people
in
need
saving
endangered
animals
and
implementing
measures
to
conserve
energy
by
engaging
in
these
initiatives
students
will
benefit
their
surrounding
community
and
environment
for
generations
to
come
it
can
be
incredibly
difficult
to
maintain
your
own
individuality
in
a
world
that
is
so
highly
influenced
by
the
opinions
of
other
people
social
media
peer
groups
and
societal
expectations
can
all
be
sources
of
stress
and
pressure
that
can
cause
us
to
forget
or
ignore
the
things
that
make
us
unique
it
s
important
to
recognize
the
importance
of
staying
true
to
who
we
are
even
if
that
means
going
against
what
others
think
we
all
have
unique
traits
and
characteristics
that
make
us
special
whether
it
is
our
interests
our
passions
or
our
beliefs
these
things
make
us
unique
and
only
serve
to
enrich
and
enhance
our
lives
so
it
s
important
to
stay
true
to
who
we
are
no
matter
what
those
around
us
may
be
saying
we
should
never
be
afraid
to
step
out
of
our
comfort
zone
and
express
our
true
selves
without
fearing
the
judgement
of
others
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
we
should
never
be
scared
to
stand
up
for
ourselves
and
be
our
own
person
it
can
be
especially
empowering
to
take
ownership
of
who
you
are
and
to
be
proud
of
the
individual
you
have
become
when
we
re
able
to
stay
true
to
ourselves
we
become
more
resilient
and
self assured
at
the
end
of
the
day
maintaining
our
individuality
in
a
world
so
highly
influenced
by
others
opinions
is
an
challenge
but
if
we
can
stay
true
to
who
we
are
and
never
forget
the
qualities
that
make
us
unique
it
can
make
us
more
confident
and
remind
us
of
our
potential
and
strengths
working
in
a
group
setting
provides
a
multitude
of
advantages
particularly
in
the
academic
setting
and
sharing
tasks
with
fellow
students
can
often
lead
to
higher
academic
success
due
to
the
division
of
labor
and
increased
opportunities
for
problem solving
additionally
working
in
groups
can
foster
important
social
skills
such
as
communication
and
teamwork
while
reducing
feelings
of
isolation
and
loneliness
that
can
often
occur
when
working
alone
finally
the
development
of
friendships
and
shared
experiences
through
working
in
a
group
setting
can
foster
positive
emotions
and
boost
morale
which
can
create
an
overall
positive
learning
experience
when
working
in
a
group
it
is
important
to
find
the
right
balance
between
collaboration
and
division
of
labor
in
order
to
optimize
the
effectiveness
and
efficiency
of
the
group
additionally
finding
solutions
that
work
for
everyone
is
vital
to
ensure
that
the
group
s
objectives
are
met
in
conclusion
group
work
provides
students
with
numerous
benefits
such
as
increased
academic
performance
improved
social
skills
and
strengthened
friendships
while
working
in
a
group
setting
can
have
its
unique
challenges
the
advantages
of
group
work
far
outweigh
its
drawbacks
in
recent
years
taking
classes
from
home
has
become
increasingly
popular
proponents
of
this
option
argue
that
it
allows
for
greater
convenience
and
freedom
allowing
students
to
adjust
their
learning
to
their
own
schedule
additionally
online
classes
can
be
lower
in
cost
than
traditional
classes
and
allow
students
to
access
materials
from
anywhere
in
the
world
however
there
are
also
some
considerable
downsides
to
studying
from
home
depending
on
the
class
it
can
be
difficult
to
receive
personalized
instruction
and
students
may
find
it
hard
to
stay
motivated
without
the
accountability
that
comes
from
being
in
a
traditional
classroom
environment
additionally
there
can
be
technological
issues
when
taking
classes
online
such
as
internet
disruptions
or
problems
with
programs
or
materials
overall
the
decision
to
take
classes
online
versus
in person
comes
down
to
individual
preference
and
goals
those
who
value
convenience
or
want
to
take
on
their
study
commitments
at
their
own
pace
may
find
that
online
classes
are
a
great
fit
for
them
while
those
who
want
more
direct
instruction
may
want
to
stick
with
in person
classes
whichever
students
choose
it
is
important
to
weigh
both
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
a
decision
after
researching
the
partnerships
local
companies
and
organizations
associated
with
my
school
i
discovered
many
activities
associated
with
each
of
them
for
example
the
local
theater
company
offers
volunteer
opportunities
while
the
art
museum
provides
educational
outreach
programs
to
the
community
additionally
each
of
these
entities
offers
a
unique
workplace
environment
the
theater
company
has
a
relaxed
and
creative
atmosphere
while
the
art
museum
has
a
more
formal
and
professional
environment
i
must
now
consider
which
type
of
workplace
would
be
the
best
fit
for
my
interests
and
preferences
the
debate
over
instituting
a
p m
weekday
curfew
for
teenagers
comes
down
to
whether
the
potential
benefits
outweigh
the
potential
risks
proponents
of
the
curfew
argue
that
it
would
help
teenagers
better
manage
their
learning
and
combat
stress
others
contend
they
would
still
be
able
to
pursue
activities
such
as
after school
clubs
and
athletics
without
having
to
resort
to
staying
up
late
at
night
opponents
of
a
curfew
suggest
that
it
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
academic
performance
as
teens
may
be
too
tired
to
do
their
homework
after
having
to
wake
up
and
go
to
school
early
the
next
day
additionally
a
curfew
could
restrict
teenagers
access
to
much needed
family
support
if
they
feel
they
ca
n t
stay
out
past
p m
there
is
also
the
possible
risk
of
teenagers
becoming
trapped
in
emergency
situations
if
they
ca
n t
return
home
before
the
curfew
in
the
end
it
s
important
to
weigh
the
potential
impacts
of
a
p m
curfew
for
teenagers
while
it
could
help
teens
better
manage
their
learning
and
reduce
stress
there
is
a
risk
of
reducing
access
to
family
support
and
putting
them
in
unsafe
or
potentially
dangerous
situations
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
introducing
a
curfew
should
be
a
thoughtful
consideration
it
s
easy
to
feel
overwhelmed
with
the
thought
that
our
lives
are
supposed
to
be
something
other
than
they
are
our
society
has
inundated
us
with
images
of
perfect
lives
each
one
more
unattainable
than
the
last
it
s
no
wonder
that
so
many
people
are
trying
to
be
something
they
re
not and
then
feeling
unhappy
and
unfulfilled
when
they
fail
we
judge
ourselves
against
an
arbitrary
standard
of
material
wealth
beauty
and
success
that
can
lead
to
a
damaging
cycle
of
self judgment
as
said
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
people
would
be
better
off
if
they
relearned
to
accept
and
value
their
true
selves
rather
than
striving
to
live
up
to
some
unattainable
definition
of
perfection
we
can
and
should
be
critical
of
ourselves
in
order
to
improve
but
we
must
keep
the
correct
perspective
we
are
unique
and
special
just
as
we
are
and
no
amount
of
external
accomplishment
is
necessary
to
validate
us
growing
up
in
a
supportive
family
environment
can
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
decision
making
for
teens
having
a
secure
and
understanding
home
to
return
to
gives
them
the
confidence
to
make
decisions
that
are
right
for
them
and
follow
their
own
path
on
the
other
hand
growing
up
in
an
unsupportive
home
can
be
an
obstacle
for
teens
who
may
feel
judged
and
disrespected
this
can
lead
to
an
atmosphere
of
fear
and
hesitancy
when
making
decisions
no
matter
the
home
environment
it
is
important
for
teens
to
recognize
their
own
intrinsic
value
this
can
be
a
difficult
skill
to
learn
since
teenagers
are
still
developing
their
sense
of
identity
and
finding
direction
in
life
it
is
essential
for
teens
to
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
understand
that
they
do
n t
have
to
conform
to
the
expectations
of
others
in
order
to
be
accepted
or
to
succeed
learning
to
trust
and
be
true
to
themselves
is
a
valuable
asset
that
can
help
teens
succeed
in
academics
relationships
and
life
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
live
our
lives
it
has
opened
the
world
up
to
people
in
unprecedented
ways
allowing
us
to
communicate
more
easily
and
quickly
than
ever
before
people
can
now
talk
to
someone
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
in
mere
seconds
sharing
knowledge
and
experiences
seamlessly
technology
has
also
enabled
us
to
access
vital
services
in
times
of
emergency
take
for
example
the
immensely
valuable
service
that
is
calling
through
the
simple
press
of
a
button
we
can
be
connected
to
professional
help
and
receive
assistance
when
needed
this
has
saved
countless
lives
over
the
years
and
is
part
of
why
technology
is
so
important
technology
has
also
made
it
quicker
and
easier
than
ever
to
access
medical
care
store
important
documents
stay
on
top
of
the
news
and
even
pursue
education
from
anywhere
in
the
world
all
of
these
benefits
are
truly
invaluable
and
further
illustrate
how
technology
has
improved
people
s
lives
going
to
the
park
is
an
enjoyable
way
to
spend
the
day
for
all
ages
parks
offer
a
variety
of
activities
that
can
be
fun
for
the
whole
family
taking
a
picnic
and
enjoying
a
nice
lunch
outdoors
is
a
great
way
to
take
advantage
of
a
sunny
day
kids
can
play
at
the
playground
while
adults
relax
and
soak
up
some
fresh
air
other
activities
that
can
be
enjoyed
at
the
park
include
biking
jogging
walking
and
swimming
some
parks
also
offer
gardens
with
statues
and
paths
perfect
for
taking
a
leisurely
stroll
the
possibilities
are
endless
with
a
trip
to
the
park
one
of
the
best
things
about
going
to
a
park
is
that
it
s
free
even
if
you
do
n t
have
a
lot
of
money
it
s
easy
to
spend
an
entire
day
without
spending
a
dime
spending
time
outdoors
is
a
great
way
to
reconnect
with
nature
and
get
away
from
daily
life
it
s
no
wonder
visits
to
parks
are
so
popular
failure
is
an
essential
part
of
success
without
experiencing
failure
it
is
challenging
to
appreciate
and
learn
from
success
failure
can
be
beneficial
in
showing
maturity
and
helping
an
individual
to
gain
enthusiasm
for
example
when
approaching
a
problem
many
of
us
have
the
tendency
to
give
up
when
faced
with
difficulty
however
failure
teaches
us
to
embrace
challenges
and
become
resilient
furthermore
failure
can
show
us
how
to
adjust
our
goals
to
better
suit
our
individual
capabilities
another
example
can
be
found
in
the
world
of
business
many
entrepreneurs
have
experienced
failure
in
their
journey
to
success
famously
failed
hundreds
of
times
when
inventing
the
light
bulb
before
finally
seeing
success
he
attributed
his
success
to
having
learnt
from
each
of
his
failures
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
failure
far
from
being
undesirable
can
be
seen
as
an
invaluable
experience
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
to
see
that
failure
has
an
influential
role
to
play
in
people
s
lives
if
they
allow
themselves
to
learn
and
grow
from
it
if
we
embrace
failure
instead
of
seeing
it
as
a
sign
of
disappointment
it
can
help
to
fuel
our
belief
that
success
can
be
achieved
i
have
used
my
imagination
to
explore
various
ideas
throughout
my
life
imagination
has
allowed
me
to
push
the
boundaries
that
knowledge
has
prescribed
and
become
more
creative
in
my
approach
to
problem
solving
it
has
also
been
an
invaluable
tool
to
help
me
envision
a
more
positive
future
an
example
of
when
imagination
was
more
successful
than
knowledge
in
my
life
was
when
i
was
trying
to
work
on
a
project
for
school
my
knowledge
of
the
subject
was
limited
but
i
was
able
to
use
my
imagination
to
think
of
creative
ideas
and
come
up
with
an
effective
solution
imagination
allowed
me
to
come
up
with
a
more
innovative
solution
that
knowledge
could
not
provide
in
the
end
this
allowed
me
to
be
successful
in
my
project
and
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
material
studying
online
or
at
home
and
attending
a
traditional
school
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
those
studying
online
or
at
home
the
lack
of
a
structured
learning
environment
can
make
it
easy
to
become
distracted
resulting
in
potentially
lower
learning
outcomes
due
to
the
lack
of
accountability
at
the
same
time
studying
online
or
at
home
provides
more
flexibility
allowing
students
to
set
their
own
schedule
and
work
in
their
own
space
in
contrast
attending
a
traditional
school
involves
in person
instruction
from
an
experienced
teacher
and
allows
students
to
gain
hands on
experience
in
terms
of
academic
performance
students
studying
from
home
will
have
to
learn
to
manage
their
time
and
become
self motivated
in
order
to
be
successful
in
their
courses
this
can
be
an
advantage
or
disadvantage
depending
on
each
student
with
regard
to
standardized
testing
such
as
the
those
who
have
taken
classes
from
home
or
online
may
do
well
if
they
have
taken
courses
that
have
prepared
them
finally
there
is
the
impact
on
social
interaction
that
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
attending
a
traditional
school
may
give
students
more
opportunities
to
interact
with
other
students
and
form
meaningful
relationships
conversely
those
who
take
classes
from
home
or
online
may
experience
a
lack
of
meaningful
social
interaction
but
may
still
be
able
to
connect
with
classmates
and
teachers
online
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
live
and
interact
with
the
rise
of
the
digital
age
individuals
and
society
have
been
able
to
benefit
from
advances
in
technology
in
a
variety
of
ways
job
applications
have
enabled
people
to
more
easily
search
for
and
apply
to
desired
job
openings
similarly

it
may
be
worthwhile
to
heed
the
advice
of
experts
while
it
s
important
to
consider
personal
anecdotes
and
stories
in
some
scenarios

long
run
phones
have
become
ingrained
in
our
lives
providing
unparalleled
opportunities
for
connection
and
resources
therefore
with
the
right
safeguards
it
is
both
feasible
and
beneficial
to
allow
the
use
of
cell
phones
in
school
phones
can
assist
in
a
student
s
learning
providing
useful
tools
for
classroom
activities
from

apps
for
complex
equations
to
interactive

have
a
wide
variety
of
useful
functions
for
bolstering
a

s
educational
pursuits
additionally
with
the
addition
of

can
be
an
efficient
way
for
students
to
easily
organize
and
store
notes
assignments
and
other
documents
aside
from
educational
uses
cell
phones
can
provide
an
important
source
of
connection
and
support
in
a
high pressure
academic
environment
staying
in
touch
with
family
and
friends
can
be
a
key
factor
in
the
success
and
wellbeing
of
a
student
furthermore
with
the
growing
prevalence
of
cyberbullying
in
schools
having
access
to
a
cell
phone
can
provide
a
student
with
a
sense
of
safety
and
security
to
alert
adults
and
authorities
in
the
face
of
potential
danger
overall
allowing
the
use
of
cell

is
a
move
towards
greater
connection
and
academic
support
with
the
necessary
safety
measures
and
policies
in

permitting
the
use
of
cell

can
be
a
crucial
step
to
providing
students
with
the
best
possible
learning
environment
having
an
after
school
homework
club
offers
significant
advantages
to
students
in
their
academics
for
one
it
helps
them
improve
their
grades
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
receive
support
from
tutors
and
peers
in
tackling
difficult
material
it
also
allows
students
to
better
reach
their
educational
goals
providing
an
extra
layer
of
guidance
and
encouragement
in
improving
their
skills
and
understanding
complex
concepts
finally
with
the

students
are
less
likely
to
forget
assignments
allowing
them

skydiving
has
been
increasingly
popular
in
recent
years
as
it
offers
a
unique
adrenaline
rush
and
stunning
views
of
the
world
below
for
those
brave
enough
to
take
on
the
challenge
skydiving
can
be
an
incredible
enjoyable
experience
furthermore
is
a
continent
full
of
interesting
countries
with
distinct
cultures
and
attractions
worth
seeing
from
stunning
mountain
ranges
to
pristine
beaches
is
an
ideal
destination
for
travelers
looking
to
broaden
their
horizons
similarly
owning
and
operating
a
construction
company
can
be
a
rewarding
endeavor
there
is
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
that
goes
into
starting
a
construction
business
but
with
the
right
research
preparation
and
perseverance
it
can
be
a
successful
venture
visiting
one
s
home
country
can
be
a
meaningful
experience
for
many
as
we
can
often
find
a
deeper
understanding
and
appreciation
of
our
past
and
roots
by
spending
time
in
the
places
where
our
stories
began
similarly
understanding
one
s
family
history
can
also
be
an
eye opening
journey
of
discovery
through
genealogy
we
can
learn
more
about
our
ancestors
and
where
we
come
from
connecting
us
with
our
collective
past
extending
the
school
day
at
by
two
hours
for
four
days
a
week
has
the
potential
to
bring
many
advantages
as
well
as
some
drawbacks
on
the
plus
side
an
added
two
hours
could
improve
student
attendance
by
providing
a
more
structured
schedule
and
giving
students
a
purpose
while
outside
of
school
increased
responsibility
could
also
be
a
result
of
extending
the
school
day
with
more
time
spent
in
the
classroom
students
would
be
better
agitated
to
perform
their
best
and
follow
the
rules
on
the
other
hand
something
that
must
be
considered
when
making
this
decision
is
the
trade off
between
school
and
extracurricular
activities
an
extra
two
hours
of
school
would
take
time
away
from
other
personal
pursuits
and
could
limit
the
amount
of
time
that
students
have
for
things
such
as
sports
music
and
community
service
ultimately
while
extending
the
school
day
could
bring
about
various
positive
changes
a
careful
evaluation
of
the
potential
benefits
and
risks
should
be
conducted
in
order
to
determine
if
the
extended
day
would
be
a
viable
option
for
in
my
opinion
given
the
potential
for
improved
student
attendance
responsibility
and
school
culture
the
pros
outweigh
the
cons
of
implementing
a
longer
school
day
in
recent
years
there
have
been
numerous
studies
about
the
power
of
small
acts
of
kindness
to
make
a
difference
in
someone
s
life
while
the
specific
results
vary
depending
on
the
location
behaviors
studied
and
population
surveyed
the
general
consensus
is
that
small
kindnesses
do
indeed
make
a
difference
in
people
s
lives
for
example
studies
in
schools
have
demonstrated
that
offering
an
offender
a
genuine
apology
or
giving
compliments
to
others
will
often
reduce
the
stress
level
for
both
the
offender
and
their
peers
providing
basic
necessities
such
as
food
or
shelter
to
someone
in
need
tends
to
reduce
feelings
of
isolation
which
can
lead
to
an
improved
outlook
on
life
and
relationships
small
acts
of
kindness
can
also
help
people
feel
connected
to
their
communities
and
their
fellow
citizens
moreover
studies
suggest
that
individuals
who
are
on
the
receiving
end
of
acts
of
kindness
are
more
likely
to
pay
it
forward
to
others
in
need
this
kindness
contagion
can
spread
rapidly
throughout
families
classrooms
neighborhoods
and
even
countries
resulting
in
a
positive
effect
in
conclusion
small
acts
of
kindness
have
been
demonstrated
to
make
a
difference
in
someone
s
life
from
reduced
stress
and
isolation
to
increased
feelings
of
connectedness
and
community
kindness
can
truly
change
the
lives
of
others
so
take
a
moment
today
and
show
a
little
kindness
to
those
around
you
you
never
know
what
impact
it
will
have
extending
the
school
day
by
an
extra
hour
would
be
an
undue
burden
on
students
of
all
ages
students
already
face
long
days
filled
with
classes
extracurriculars
and
work
or
family
obligations
adding
an
extra
hour
would
leave
little
time
for
students
to
focus
on
self care
or
devote
time
to
their
hobbies
furthermore
students
tend
to
have
diminishing
returns
of
productivity
after
a
certain
number
of
hours
in
the
school
day
their
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
can
cause
them
to
have
difficulty
paying
attention
and
comprehending
new
material
also
too
much
schooling
can
lead
to
burnout
in
students
who
are
already
pushed
to
their
limits
due
to
the
increasing
demand
for
good
grades
and
extracurricular
activities
burnout
can
lead
to
students
feeling
overwhelmed
and
lacking
the
motivation
to
engage
in
their
studies
which
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
their
academic
performance
an
extended
school
day
can
also
take
away
from
other
important
activities
that
are
essential
to
a
student
s
wellbeing
and
long term
success
time
and
pursuing
hobbies
can
help
students
develop
qualities
like
creativity
perseverance
and
critical
thinking
which
are
all
key
to
success
in
the
real
world
based
on
these
reasons
i
believe
an
extended
school
day
would
be
an
unnecessary
burden
on
students
and
should
not
be
implemented
many
people
become
overwhelmed
when
they
have
a
lofty
goal
in
mind
whether
it
be
a
dream
job
a
lifestyle
change
or
an
entirely
new
career
setting
the
aim
too
high
can
backfire
leading
to
discouragement
and
even
failure
instead
of
attempting
to
reach
the
top
in
one
large
leap
it
is
beneficial
to
set
the
aim
slightly
lower
and
take
achievable
steps
forward
this
strategy
helps
to
build
character
create
a
roadmap
for
success
and
instill
a
sense
of
hope
and
accomplishment
additionally
taking
small
risks
can
help
to
spur
innovation
and
growth
in
one
s
life
it
is
important
to
remember
though
that
risks
should
not
be
taken
at
the
expense
of
one
s
safety
and
wellbeing
instead
small
risks
should
be
balanced
against
both
short term
and
long term
goals
and
should
create
positive
opportunities
that
lead
up
the
ladder
of
success
ultimately
it
is
important
to
think
before
taking
any
kind
of
action
whether
it
is
setting
the
aim
high
or
low
weighing
the
risks
and
benefits
of
any
endeavour
is
key
to
achieving
success
this
thought
process
can
help
to
ensure
that
one
s
hard
work
and
dedication
are
directed
towards
realistic
goals
and
have
the
best
possible
outcome
as
evidenced
by
the
essay
there
are
several
advantages
to
children
not
performing
community
service
it
can
be
an
overwhelming
and
emotionally
draining
experience
especially
for
younger
children
at
such
a
young
age
kids
may
not
yet
have
the
emotional
maturity
needed
to
process
difficult
interactions
with
members
of
the
community
also
community
service
projects
require
the
completion
of
a
certain
degree
of
physical
labor
or
participation
in
other
activities
for
which
younger
children
may
not
be
ready
additionally
since
these
activities
are
often
outdoors
the
physical
exertion
can
be
extremely
taxing
on
growing
bodies
finally
children
should
be
allowed
the
time
and
freedom
to
enjoy
their
childhoods
and
focus
on
developing
skills
that
are
important
to
their
personal
growth
and
development
traveling
the
world
has
always
been
a
dream
of
mine
with
that
said
there
are
three
places
i
would
most
love
to
visit london
and
has
always
held
a
place
in
my
heart
to
visit
the
city
that
is
the
basis
for
many
of
my
favorite
films
would
be
an
incredible
experience
it
would
be
amazing
to
visit
all
of
the
historic
landmarks
such
as
the
and
i
would
also
love
to
take
a
food
tour
in
some
of
s
famous
restaurants
such
as
outdoor
pubs
in
and
famous
seafood
markets
in
is
another
destination
i
would
love
to
visit
i
would
love
to
visit
the
famous
and
witness
its
gorgeous
architecture
in
person
exploring
the
local
cultures
and
immersing
myself
in
the
vibrant
atmosphere
would
be
a
unique
and
enriching
experience
additionally
i
would
love
to
spend
time
aiding
some
of
s
most
impoverished
communities
finally
i
would
love
to
visit
and
explore
the
country
s
unique
attractions
visiting
shrines
in
strolling
the
streets
of
and
hiking
the
scenic
japanese
countryside
would
be
remarkable
additionally
i
would
love
to
try
some
of
the
famous
japanese
dishes
and
delve
into
its
incredible
art
and
culture
overall
exploring
the
cities
of
and
would
offer
an
incredible
experience
one
i
would
truly
cherish
technology
has
revolutionized
our
lives
in
countless
ways
both
saving
us
time
and
effort
in
our
everyday
tasks
while
also
introducing
new
dangers
and
potential
pitfalls
on
one
hand
cell
phones
and
computers
have
allowed
people
to
connect
with
one
another
in
ways
that
were
never
before
possible
however
this
connectivity
can
have
a
dark
side
as
well
for
example
cell
phones
in
schools
can
be
an
immense
distraction
to
students
resulting
in
a
lack
of
focus
and
a
degraded
quality
of
education
even
more
dangerously
the
use
of
cell
phones
while
driving
can
be
deadly
and
lead
to
serious
accidents
additionally
the
pervasive
use
of
technology
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
social
skills
among
its
users
with
a
greater
tendency
toward
solitude
and
less
face to face
contact
with
other
humans
this
in
turn
can
lead
to
an
increased
susceptibility
to
feelings
of
isolation
and
loneliness
as
well
as
a
growing
dependence
on
technology
in
extreme
cases
this
reliance
can
lead
to
a
virtual
addiction
to
technology
where
people
come
to
rely
on
it
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
in
sum
it
is
important
to
proceed
with
caution
when
discussing
both
the
benefits
and
harms
of
technology
while
it
can
be
a
powerful
tool
to
improve
our
lives
it
also
has
the
potential
to
cause
serious
problems
if
used
incorrectly
technology
is
a
powerful
force
for
good
when
it
comes
to
physical
health
reading
and
decision making
it

when
it
comes

moreover
technology
provides
access
to
reliable

allowing
individuals
to
make
judgement

technology
can
be
a
tremendous

to
reach
out
to
experts
for
advice
on
their
decisions
providing
access
to
insights
and
expert
opinions
from
highly
experienced
sources
in
my
own
experience
technology
has
had
a
profoundly
positive
impact
for
instance
when
i
was
considering
which
university
to
attend
i
was
able
to
use
the
internet
to
find
relevant
information
read
reviews
about
each
university
and
even
contact
alumni
to
hear
their
experiences
this
gave
me
a
more
informed
understanding
of
each
school
enabling
me
to
make
the
right
decision
for
my
future
overall
technology
has
provided
us
with
unprecedented
opportunities
to
stay
healthy
become
more
knowledgeable
and
make
more
informed
decisions
learning
how
to
use
technology
more
effectively
can
enable
us
to
make
better
and
more
informed
decisions
allowing
us
to
make
the
most
out
of
our
lives
the
potential
addition
of
an
extra
hour
and
thirty
minutes
to
school
each
day
for
students
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
their
lives
for
example
it
is
possible
that
student
performance
could
improve
if
they
are
given
extra
time
to
focus
on
studies
or
better
understand
the
material
additionally
this
increase
in
time
may
limit
the
amount
of
time
available
for
family
and
peer
relationships
due
to
the
addition
of
more
school
hours
local
school
districts
could
be
faced
with
strain
due
to
the
heightened
burden
of
providing
teachers
resources
and
updating
curriculum
to
accommodate
the
addition
in
conclusion
the
implications
of
adding
extra
time
to
the
school
day
should
be
carefully
considered
before
any
additional
hours
are
added
the
recently
proposed
four day
school
week
has
been
met
with
both
enthusiasm
and
skepticism
proponents
of
the
four day
week
argue
that
the
extended
school
day
could
produce
more
time
for
reinforcement
of
both
academic
and
non academic
lessons
and
activities
within
the
school
day
such
as
special
education
and
programs
additionally
families
could
benefit
financially
due
to
the
cost
savings
associated
with
child
care
during
the
fifth
day
of
the
school
week
despite
these
potential
benefits
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
a
four day
school
week
as
well
extending
the
length
of
the
school
day
by
two
hours
could
result
in
students
feeling
overwhelmed
and
anxious
about
prolonged
days
in
the
classroom
additionally
research
shows
that
on
average
students
academic
performance
decreases
when
the
length
of
the
school
day
increases
ultimately
whether
a
four day
school
week
is
beneficial
or
detrimental
is
largely
dependent
on
the
implementation
and
expectations
placed
on
students
and
faculty
alike
joining
extracurricular
activities
can
be
an
invaluable
part
of
a
child
s
educational
journey
allowing
students
to
explore
their
interests
make
new
friends
and
grow
emotionally
and
intellectually
however
allowing
students
to
choose
which
activities
they
participate
in
also
carries
several
risks
without
parental
guidance
students
run
the
risk
of
making
choices
that
might
not
be
in
their
best
academic
or
social
interests
additionally
leaving
the
decision
up
to
the
students
can
lead
to
inconsistency
in
terms
of
the
messages
they
are
receiving
from
adults
and
peers
this
could
lead
to
the
student
feeling
overwhelmed
or
uncertain
about
which
activities
are
right
for
them
ultimately
whether
or
not
to
leave
the
decision
of
joining
extracurricular
activities
up
to
students
depends
on
the
age
and
maturity
of
the
student
as
well
as
the
quality
of
the
guidance
from
parents
and
teachers
was
a
successful
business
owner
but
he
was
n t
satisfied
he
wanted
to
accomplish
something
beyond
what
he
d
already
achieved
so
he
decided
to
explore
a
new
area
of
knowledge the
study
of
marine
ecology
as
he
dove
into
the
unfamiliar
subject
experienced
difficult
challenges
but
it
did
n t
stop
him
from
meeting
and
surpassing
his
goals
quickly
realized
that
in
order
to
succeed
he
needed
to
call
on
all
his
past
knowledge
and
experience
he
rethought
the
problem solving
techniques
he
d
used
successfully
in
the
past
and
applied
them
to
his
current
situation
he
took
a
course
in
oceanography
and
talked
to
experts
who
had
considerable
experience
learning
from
their
successes
and
failures
he
scoured
libraries
and
the
internet
for
the
latest
research
by
continually
seeking
knowledge
in
this
new
field
gained
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
subject
he
could
delve
deeper
into
issues
and
make
innovative
connections
that
offered
potential
solutions
his
confidence
in
understanding
the
subject
matter
grew
and
with
it
his
success
the
experience
taught
an
important
lesson knowledge
and
experience
are
essential
to
grow
and
succeed
in
life
with
every
challenge
gained
not
only
knowledge
but
confidence
that
he
could
meet
and
surpass
any
goal
if
he
was
willing
to
seek
out
the
right
resources
by
pulling
from
his
past
experiences
and
continually
learning
in
his
new
field
was
able
to
achieve
his
goals
and
grow
into
a
successful
marine
ecologist
is
far
more
important
than
imagination
as
it
lays
the
foundation
for
progress
and
innovation
having
knowledge
enables
one
to
apply
creative
and
innovative
thought
to
craft
solutions
to
existing
problems
as
well
as
to
explore
new
avenues
of
research
and
discovery
without
knowledge
imagination
is
severely
limited
in
its
scope
and
impact
citing
historical
examples
of
great
fiction
from
s
science
fiction
stories
to
modern
movies
and
television
series
most
of
these
creative
works
are
rooted
in
some
kind
of
science based
knowledge
of
the
physical
world
without
an
understanding
of
the
physics
of
space
travel
the
imaginative
worlds
created
would
lack
any
kind
of
reality
or
believability
provides
us
with
the
framework
and
insight
to
apply
our
imagination
productively
turning
dream
worlds
into
reality
without
knowledge
imagination
can
only
take
us
so
far
character
is
fundamental
to
understanding
one
s
personality
it
is
ascertained
by
what
we
choose
and
the
effects
of
external
influences
ultimately
our
individual
character
is
the
result
of
our
own
choices
combined
with
the
impact
of
the
environment
on
our
lives
our
experiences
both
good
and
bad
shape
our
character
in
ways
that
we
may
not
be
aware
of
life
throws
unexpected
challenges
our
way
our
choices
in
response
to
them
allow
us
to
develop
resilience
and
inner
strength
the
guidance
of
those
around
us
can
help
us
learn
to
be
strong
courageous
and
determined
equally
the
example
that
our
parents
mentors
and
friends
set
can
influence
our
decisions
and
mold
our
character
in
both
positive
and
negative
ways
similarly
the
media
and
culture
that
we
are
exposed
to
are
essential
players
in
developing
our
character
the
messages
that
these
sources
promote
can
shape
our
thoughts
and
attitudes
affecting
our
behavior
down
the
line
similarly
our
educational
and
professional
experiences
can
significantly
impact
who
we
are
and
how
we
perceive
the
world
in
the
end
character
is
shaped
both
by
our
individual
choices
and
the
influences
of
the
external
world
the
journey
we
choose
and
the
resources
that
we
leverage
along
the
way
determine
who
we
become
and
how
we
approach
life
it
is
important
that
we
strive
to
seek
out
positive
influences
and
choose
wisely
when
presented
with
difficult
decisions
curfews
are
a
useful
and
often
necessary
tool
to
help
keep
teenagers
out
of
trouble
they
provide
an
invaluable
element
of
safety
for
teens
of
all
ages
allowing
parents
to
better
ensure
their
children
come
home
safe
and
on
time
however
curfews
can
also
be
seen
as
unfairly
limiting
the
lives
of
young
people
limiting
or
prohibiting
their
access
to
certain
crucial
social
activities
or
experiences
on
one
hand
a
strict
curfew
enforced
in
a
household
can
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
it
allows
parents
to
have
a
sense
of
control
over
their
children
and
can
help
to
keep
them
out
of
situations
that
could
be
unhealthy
or
even
dangerous
it
also
provides
a
space
for
teenagers
to
all
have
the
same
level
of
respect
for
safety
and
responsibility
that
can
help
to
lower
the
risk
of
involvement
in
criminal
activities
on
the
other
hand
curfews
can
also
be
restrictive
for
young
people
limiting
their
ability
to
make
their
own
decisions
and
explore
the
world
around
them
some
teens
may
feel
overprotected
or
limited
in
their
access
to
certain
places
or
experiences
parents
should
be
mindful
of
their
children
s
needs
and
try
to
provide
a
balance
between
safety
and
freedom
overall
curfews
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
safety
of
teenagers
in
many
households
however
they
should
also
be
used
thoughtfully
parents
should
be
certain
to
provide
their
children
with
enough
freedom
to
explore
and
find
their
own
identity
while
still
keeping
the
lines
of
communication
and
trust
open
at
all
times
with
a
sensible
curfew
system
in
place
teens
can
be
given
the
opportunity
to
act
responsibly
and
benefit
from
both
safety
and
freedom
entering
high
school
provides
an
opportunity
for
adolescents
to
develop
their
understanding
of
the
world
and
begin
preparing
for
life
beyond
it
by
engaging
in
a
career
decision
early
in
their
academic
career
high
school
students
benefit
from
having
a
clearer
direction
in
their
studies
as
they
move
toward
post secondary
years
understanding
and
focusing
on
their
desired
profession
early
on
provides
a
benefit
in
the
form
of
more
specialized
instruction
and
knowledge
at
the
same
time
making
career
decisions
in
high
school
can
also
pose
some
limitations
confined
to
the
structure
of
their
school
high
schoolers
might
limit
their
opportunities
to
explore
a
wider
range
of
experiences
without
more
exposure
to
potential
paths
students
may
determine
their
future
based
on
an
incomplete
understanding
and
be
unable
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
that
arise
later
on
additionally
when
students
put
all
their
efforts
into
a
single
subject
or
field
they
may
also
miss
out
on
other
useful
lessons
and
skills
which
could
be
useful
in
any
avenue
phones
are
becoming
increasingly
prevalent
in
schools
and
this
raises
concerns
about
their
potential
impact
on
students
academic
performance
and
playing
games
on
cell
phones
during
class
time
can
serve
to
distract
students
from
their
learning
studies
have
found
a
correlation
between
frequent
cell
phone
use
and
lower
academic
performance
though
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
cell
phone
use
causes
poor
academic
performance
in
some
cases
students
may
use
cell
phones
for
educational
activities
in
school
such
as
researching
and
writing
assignments
allowing
cell
phone
use
in
school
potentially
gives
students
wider
access
to
educational
resources
although
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
students
are
using
phones
responsibly
in
class
as
an
alternative
to
forbidding
cell
phones
in
school
some
schools
are
promoting
responsible
use
through
policies
that
ask
students
to
switch
their
phones
to
silent
during
class
and
take
digital
breaks
other
schools
are
proposing
a
technological
solution
such
as
network
monitoring
software
to
track
how
students
use
their
devices
on
school
premises
after
school
programs
have
become
increasingly
popular
for
both
students
and
teachers
not
only
do
they
provide
students
and
teachers
with
the
opportunity
to
learn
new
material
but
they
also
allow
for
the
chance
to
gain
better
grades
on
quizzes
and
tests
these
programs
offer
the
ability
for
both
students
and
teachers
to
apply
the
knowledge
they
have
gained
throughout
the
school
day
something
that
is
essential
for
career
and
academic
success
through
after
school
programs
students
and
teachers
have
the
chance
to
volunteer
to
help
others
understand
or
finish
tasks
which
not
only
reinforces
their
knowledge
but
also
promotes
camaraderie
and
team building
skills
having
an
after
school
program
provides
crucial
insight
into
real world
scenarios
and
fosters
students
extracurricular
abilities
it
presents
students
with
essential
leadership
and
problem solving
skills
that
help
them
excel
beyond
a
learning
environment
through
creative
hands on
learning
students
stay
ahead
in
their
classes
and
gain
a
better
understanding
of
their
overall
academic
performance
for
teachers
after
school
programs
can
provide
unique
perspectives
on
certain
topics
that
can
be
applied
in
their
classroom
materials
having
an
after
school
program
is
a
beneficial
endeavor
for
both
students
and
teachers
it
encourages
knowledge
application
promotes
career
and
academic
success
and
allows
students
and
teachers
the
opportunity
to
cultivate
skills
they
may
not
possess
in
the
classroom
setting
one
key
factor
in
leading
a
successful
life
is
having
a
good
attitude
a
positive
outlook
can
benefit
us
in
many
ways
it
can
help
us
see
the
good
in
any
situation
overcome
obstacles
motivate
us
to
stay
goal oriented
and
improve
our
relationships
with
others
recently
i
experienced
the
positive
effects
of
having
a
good
attitude
first hand
my
parents
had
always
told
me
to
remain
positive
no
matter
the
situation
i
decided
to
take
their
advice
and
put
it
into
practice
when
it
came
to
my
professional
endeavors
after
months
of
job
searching
i
was
starting
to
get
discouraged
however
i
kept
a
positive
outlook
and
persevered
in
the
end
i
was
able
to
land
my
dream
job
had
i
let
my
discouragement
get
the
best
of
me
my
outcomes
may
have
been
much
different
this
experience
proved
that
having
a
good
attitude
can
have
a
lasting
impact
by
following
my
parents
advice
to
maintain
a
positive
outlook
i
was
able
to
accomplish
something
i
never
thought
possible
and
ultimately
improve
the
outcome
of
my
situation
in
recent
years
the
rise
of
internet
platforms
has
had
a
great
impact
on
the
development
of
individual
character
the
ubiquity
of
social
media
particularly
has
had
a
profound
effect
on
how
people
interact
and
express
themselves
this
in
turn
can
lead
to
social
pressure
for
people
to
act
a
certain
way
in
order
to
conform
to
ideals
and
expectations
of
others
this
pressure
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
influences
on
a
person
s
character
depending
on
how
they
choose
to
respond
to
it
for
example
a
person
might
choose
to
yield
to
the
pressure
and
become
more
outgoing
in
an
effort
to
present
a
certain
image
of
themselves
or
they
could
reject
the
pressure
and
remain
true
to
their
own
values
and
beliefs
in
either
case
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
development
of
character
relies
heavily
on
a
person
s
own
decisions
and
actions
not
on
the
influence
of
internet
platforms
in
recent
discussion
the
school
board
has
proposed
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
while
making
more
school
time
available
may
appeal
to
some
it
is
important
to
consider
the
consequences
associated
with
this
change
for
one
lengthening
the
school
day
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
student
s
mental
emotional
and
physical
health
students
will
become
overwhelmed
by
the
stress
of
a
longer
day
and
unable
to
learn
effectively
this
can
lead
to
greater
levels
of
absenteeism
and
dropping
out
of
school
in
addition
increased
school
time
will
require
considerable
resources
funds
must
be
allocated
to
pay
teachers
and
staff
for
additional
hours
and
money
may
need
to
be
spent
on
additional
electricity
heating
and
school
supplies
with
these
costs
it
is
highly
unlikely
the
school
could
offer
an
array
of
academic
and
extracurricular
activities
that
enliven
student
learning
and
provide
outlets
for
creativity
and
socialization
finally
it
is
possible
that
one
and
a
half
hours
of
additional
school
time
would
not
be
used
efficiently
by
students
or
teachers
with
some
of
the
work
expected
to
be
completed
at
home
students
may
be
unable
to
access
deadlines
and
guidance
from
teachers
class
sizes
may
increase
leading
to
reduced
collaboration
time
and
individualized
instruction
this
situation
may
put
even
more
strain
on
the
students
and
possibly
lead
to
unsatisfactory
academic
performance
students
may
have
difficulty
using
the
extra
time
in
the
day
to
explore
interests
or
engage
in
quality
leisure
activities
an
already
unsatisfactory
work life
balance
for
students
may
become
even
more
disheartening
with
the
increase
in
school
hours
considering
the
potential
consequences
of
a
longer
school
day
the
school
board
should
weigh
all
options
carefully
before
making
a
decision
as
such
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
is
an
impractical
solution
that
fails
to
address
the
issues
of
mental
health
resources
and
efficient
use
of
time
the
park
is
a
place
that
should
be
enjoyed
often
yet
the
truth
is
that
it
is
not
visited
as
much
as
it
used
to
be
even
though
the
park
is
a
place
for
multiple
purposes
such
as
recreation
relaxation
and
education
not
enough
people
are
taking
advantage
of
its
advantages
the
park
has
great
potential
to
be
a
place
of
much
fun
and
entertainment
it
can
provide
activities
that
people
of
all
ages
can
enjoy
these
activities
can
include
playing
team
sports
such
as
basketball
soccer
and
volleyball
as
well
as
individual
activities
like
running
biking
and
hiking
there
can
also
be
outdoor
games
like
the
hide and seek
badminton
and
outdoor
chess
the
park
can
also
offer
outdoor
concert
venues
for
bands
and
art
festivals
places
to
picnic
and
grill
and
outdoor
movie
theaters
despite
these
attractive
possibilities
many
people
still
don
t
make
use
of
the
park
this
is
most
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
people
are
more
involved
with
technology
such
as
computers
tablets
and
phones
and
spend
most
of
their
time
indoors
in
addition
people
don
t
make
enough
time
for
proper
nutrition
and
physical
wellness
it
is
important
that
people
remember
the
importance
of
the
park
in
our
lives
provide
a
great
place
to
clear
the
mind
and
escape
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
daily
life
groves
of
trees
also
provide
important
habitat
for
birds
and
other
wildlife
people
should
make
use
of
these
areas
and
reap
the
rewards
of
being
physically
active
outdoors
overall
parks
should
be
a
place
for
us
to
enjoy
and
have
fun
with
the
right
activities
the
park
can
become
a
place
that
people
around
the
world
visit
often
let
s
make
use
of
the
natural
beauty
of
the
park
and
start
having
enjoyable
outdoor
activities
today
as
the
temperatures
drop
and
winter
approaches
it
is
important
to
consider
the
possible
risks
associated
with
this
season
while
longer
summer
and
winter
breaks
might
sound
appealing
there
are
pros
and
cons
that
must
be
taken
into
account
educators
have
varying
opinions
on
whether
or
not
it
is
beneficial
to
have
longer
breaks
and
it
s
important
to
look
at
why
people
are
pushing
for
more
time
off
ultimately
the
benefits
of
having
more
leisure
time
for
students
should
be
weighed
against
the
risks
of
having
shorter
time
to
learn
after
research
into
the
subject
it
has
become
clear
that
requiring
students
to
take
classes
such
as
art
music
or
drama
can
have
multiple
drawbacks
firstly
students
may
feel
unmotivated
or
uninspired
by
the
subject
matter
leading
them
to
skip
classes
resulting
in
lower
overall
attendance
and
grades
similarly
when
a
student
is
required
to
take
a
class
they
are
not
passionate
about
their
enthusiasm
decreases
and
they
become
less
interested
in
learning
in
general
this
decreased
interest
in
learning
can
affect
a
student
s
motivation
levels
in
all
classes
therefore
when
mandating
classes
such
as
art
music
or
drama
for
all
students
their
overall
grades
attendance
and
motivation
levels
can
suffer
when
it
comes
to
completing
projects
and
assignments
students
often
must
decide
between
working
as
a
group
or
working
alone
working
as
a
group
has
several
benefits
it
allows
for
multiple
perspectives
and
can
help
students
divide
up
the
work
so
projects
can
be
completed
more
quickly
working
in
a
group
also
provides
students
with
the
opportunity
to
meet
new
people
and
learn
from
each
other
on
the
other
hand
individual
work
has
its
own
advantages
working
independently
allows
students
to
explore
topics
more
deeply
and
have
the
flexibility
to
try
different
angles
and
approaches
furthermore
it
creates
an
opportunity
for
students
to
seek
out
new
challenges
and
refine
their
own
skills
ultimately
the
success
of
any
project
or
assignment
is
dependent
upon
the
individual
student
or
group
s
motivation
and
collaborative
approach
working
as
a
group
or
working
alone
can
both
lead
to
successful
outcomes
and
the
best
choice
often
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
task
and
the
students
collaborative
capabilities
when
it
comes
to
items
found
on
the
ground
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
our
actions
and
think
twice
before
taking
something
that
is
not
ours
doing
so
can
have
serious
consequences
not
only
from
a
legal
standpoint
but
also
on
our
moral
character
taking
something
found
on
the
ground
that
someone
else
has
lost
shows
a
lack
of
respect
for
that
person
s
belongings
and
is
a
sign
of
disrespect
towards
them
not
only
this
but
it
also
implies
a
disregard
for
the
law
and
our
own
principles
as
we
are
breaking
the
law
and
taking
something
that
does
not
belong
to
us
furthermore
taking
something
that
is
not
ours
can
unintentionally
lead
to
more
serious
consequences
such
as
theft
therefore
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
our
actions
when
it
comes
to
items
found
on
the
ground
and
not
take
something
that
is
not
ours
in
order
to
remain
within
legal
boundaries
and
develop
a
sense
of
morality
and
respect
for
other
people
s
property
as
humans
living
in
a
rapidly
changing
world
it
is
essential
to
remember
the
importance
of
being
ourselves
being
our
authentic
selves
helps
us
maintain
a
sense
of
self acceptance
and
inner
peace
as
we
find
joy
and
contentment
within
our
own
unique
quirks
and
qualities
embracing
our
original
identities
allows
us
to
enjoy
everything
life
has
to
offer
without
feeling
the
pressure
to
conform
or
meet
unrealistic
expectations
living
an
honest
and
genuine
life
can
also
be
beneficial
on
a
larger
scale
whether
it
s
through
our
relationships
with
family
friends
colleagues
or
the
larger
society
authenticity
encourages
honest
and
positive
interactions
it
is
only
through
showing
our
true
selves
that
we
can
achieve
meaningful
deep
connections
with
others
that
will
benefit
us
in
the
long
run
on
the
other
hand
wearing
a
fake
persona
can
hide
our
underlying
insecurities
but
it
does
not
lead
to
true
contentment
or
lasting
relationships
having
to
pretend
to
be
someone
we
re
not
can
sometimes
have
negative
consequences
such
as
confusing
our
true
identity
or
bringing
us
unhappiness
ultimately
being
ourselves
is
far
more
beneficial
than
trying
to
be
something
we
re
not
in
conclusion
demonstrating
our
authentic
selves
can
be
beneficial
in
countless
ways
from
achieving
inner
peace
and
self acceptance
to
forming
meaningful
connections
with
others
it
is
only
by
embracing
our
unique
qualities
that
we
can
experience
the
joy
of
living
our
most
genuine
and
authentic
life
in
s
words

be
yourself
in
a

that
is
constantly
trying

make
you
something

the
greatest
accomplishment

statement
captures
the
essence
of
living
authentically

confidently
in
an
ever shifting

a
life
of
purpose
and

be
a
daunting
task
filled
with
obstacles
and
challenges
yet

in
this

can
offer
immense
satisfaction
and
fulfillment
at
its

us
to
honour
our
true
selves
and
trust
our
innate
knowledge
and
wisdom
we
are
all
unique
individuals
with
unique
stories
and
we
should
strive
to
stay
true
to
our
own
paths
and
experiences
we
should
not
allow
external
forces
such
as
the
opinions
and
expectations
of

to

our
priorities
instead
we

created
an
essential
dialogue
on
self mastery
and
resilience
being

is
no
easy

and
it
requires
tremendous
dedication
courage
and
confidence
it
is
up
to

is
timeless
to

in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make

is
indeed
the
greatest
accomplishment
planning
a
trip
to
is
an
exciting
task
with
places
to
visit
like
the
and
it
s
easy
to
get
lost
in
the
historical
significance
of
the
city
additionally
the
various
museums
such
as
the
and
and
offer
a
great
opportunity
to
gain
insight
into
the
culture
of
of
course
no
trip
to
would
be
complete
without
a
visit
to
the
with
these
activities
there
is
something
for
everyone
the
key
to
a
successful
trip
is
in
the
planning
to
ensure
you
do
n t
miss
a
single
activity
it
is
essential
to
create
an
itinerary
before
arriving
at
the
itinerary
should
include
the
day
each
activity
will
be
conducted
as
well
as
how
long
should
be
spent
at
each
destination
this
will
help
maximize
your
adventure
in
the
city
finally
it
s
time
to
start
writing
use
your
research
experiences
and
itinerary
to
craft
a
detailed
essay
about
your
trip
to
include
the
sights
you
saw
the
food
you
ate
and
the
people
you
interacted
with
this
will
help
you
remember
your
trip
for
years
to
come
with
these
steps
planning
a
trip
to
can
be
an
enjoyable
experience
whether
you
are
looking
for
a
quick
weekend
getaway
or
an
extended
vacation
is
a
great
destination
for
travelers
of
all
kinds
in
today
s
world
the
importance
of
following
one
s
instincts
and
ideas
can
not
be
understated
whether
it
involves
deciding
how
to
pursue
a
career
form
a
relationship
or
plan
for
the
future
trusting
your
own
judgment
is
a
cornerstone
of
successful
decision making
in
oneself
can
be
key
to
realising
one
s
full
potential
and
ensuring
the
most
rewarding
life
experience
relying
on
external
guidance
and
advice
is
a
natural
chip
in
the
process
of
forming
decisions
but
in
the
end
it
is
your
choices
that
will
shape
the
life
you
create
for
yourself
following
someone
else
s
ideas
can
prevent
you
from
discovering
solutions
and
opportunities
that
align
with
your
best
interests
as
such
it
is
often
better
to
develop
and
trust
the
wisdom
of
your
own
judgement
than
to
rely
solely
on
the
opinions
of
others
it
is
important
to
remember
that
instinct
and
ideas
should
only
be
used
as
a
tool
to
make
better
and
more
informed
decisions
too
much
focus
on
one
s
own
desires
and
impulses
can
lead
to
imprudent
choices
and
dire
consequences
striking
a
balance
between
the
two
is
essential
in
ensuring
that
your
actions
are
guided
by
sound
judgement
and
rationale
therefore
while
gathering
external
guidance
and
considering
the
opinions
of
others
should
not
be
disregarded
it
is
important
to
remember
that
following
your
own
instincts
and
ideas
is
often
the
best
way
to
ensure
the
most
satisfying
and
rewarding
life
imagine
growing
up
in
a
society
where
everyone
looks
the
same
and
acts
the
same
you
turn
everyone
follows
the
same
trends
follows
the
same
rules
and
lives
life
in
the
same
way
are
we
really
living
life
to
its
fullest
potential
this
way
it
s
time
to
step
out
of
the
mold
of
societal
expectations
and
bring
out
our
true
power
by
being
ourselves
the
beauty
of
being
yourself
is
that
you
can
make
a
unique
and
powerful
statement
in
the
world
everyone
has
unique
strengths
and
talents
to
share
and
if
we
spend
all
our
time
trying
to
fit
into
societal
stereotypes
we
will
be
unable
to
take
full
advantage
of
these
gifts
by
embracing
the
power
of
who
we
are
we
can
create
something
incredible
on
the
flip
side
focusing
too
much
on
trying
to
fit
into
societal
stereotypes
can
lead
us
on
a
path
of
conformity
we
are
shying
away
from
the
power
of
being
ourselves
and
losing
sight
of
what
makes
us
unique
we
are
robbing
the
world
of
our
power
to
create
something
beautiful
by
trying
to
be
like
everyone
else
when
we
embrace
our
unique
strengths
and
talents
we
can
contribute
to
society
in
a
much
more
meaningful
way
we
can
connect
with
others
through
our
talents
and
use
our
unique
perspectives
to
create
a
better
reality
the
power
of
being
yourself
is
that
it
allows
us
to
make
a
positive
and
lasting
difference
in
our
own
lives
and
the
lives
of
those
around
us
we
must
use
this
powerful
tool
wisely
to
create
a
better
world
for
ourselves
and
for
future
generations
chinese
culture
has
a
long
history
of
confucian
values
which
emphasize
education
and
self improvement
through
study
and
contemplation
this
is
in
stark
contrast
to
the
philosophy
of
who
values
self reliance
independence
and
intuition
to
the
chinese
education
and
tradition
are
extremely
important
and
students
are
taught
to
learn
and
grow
from
the
wisdom
of
their
elders
additionally
chinese
families
and
communities
place
a
high
value
on
respect
and
loyalty
for
on
the
other
hand
self improvement
is
achieved
not
through
studying
conventional
wisdom
but
rather
through
individualism
open minded
exploration
and
creativity
thus
there
is
a
distinctly
different
outlook
between
the
two
philosophies
with
chinese
learning
focusing
on
respect
for
tradition
while
s
is
centered
on
the
exploration
of
ideas
when
i
was
in
college
i
learned
a
lesson
that
has
forever
changed
how
i
view
and
react
to
life
s
experiences
i
was
having
a
hard
time
deciding
on
which
career
path
i
wanted
to
take
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
many
choices
available
one
of
my
mentors
pulled
me
aside
and
said
you
do
n t
need
to
have
all
the
answers
right
now
do
your
best
to
make
the
most
informed
decisions
you
can
in
the
moment
and
do
n t
let
fear
or
worry
stop
you
from
trying
something
new
in
the
end
it
is
all
part
of
the
learning
process
this
wise
advice
has
stayed
with
me
ever
since
and
i
have
found
that
it
has
served
me
well
when
faced
with
difficult
or
ambiguous
situations
i
try
to
take
a
step
back
and
think
strategically
i
remind
myself
that
life
is
an
ongoing
process
of
learning
and
that
it
is
ok
to
make
mistakes
as
long
as
i
try
my
best
this
mindset
has
enabled
me
to
take
risks
and
try
new
things
without
being
held
back
by
fear
it
has
given
me
the
courage
to
explore
opportunities
that
seemed
out
of
reach
before
overall
this
important
lesson
has
helped
shape
my
outlook
on
life
and
given
me
the
confidence
to
make
informed
decisions
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
by
examining
our
options
and
being
mindful
of
our
decisions
we
can
take
charge
of
our
destiny
set
goals
and
work
to
achieve
them
in
the
modern
world
technology
is
ubiquitous
we
rely
on
it
for
almost
everything
from
communication
to
entertainment
to
running
businesses
the
potential
benefits
of
technology
are
numerous
including
improved
communication
enhanced
efficiency
increased
access
to
information
and
the
ability
to
increase
productivity
however
there
are
also
health
risks
associated
with
the
misuse
of
technology
such
as
sleep
deprivation
obesity
and
musculoskeletal
problems
from
too
much
sitting
the
evolution
of
technology
has
been
remarkable
over
the
past
decades
with
the
advent
of
the
internet
access
to
instant
information
has
revolutionized
how
we
obtain
knowledge
in
addition
advances
in
artificial
intelligence
have
enabled
machines
to
take
on
tasks
that
were
traditionally
done
by
humans
such
as
data
analysis
and
machine
learning
despite
these
impressive
advancements
the
effects
of
overreliance
on
technology
are
still
being
examined
it
has
been
suggested
that
excessive
use
of
technology
can
create
a
rift
in
social
life
replacing
face to face
contact
with
virtual
connections
in
some
cases
humans
have
adapted
to
use
technology
in
a
creative
way
to
survive
and
flourish
for
example
technology
can
be
used
to
better
manage
natural
resources
like
water
or
energy
usage
in
order
to
conserve
them
in
addition
the
use
of
technology
in
waste
free
living
has
been
explored
as
an
option
for
reducing
environmental
impact
such
as
through
the

when
approaching
similar

in

to

it

that

the

one
of
the
most

benefits
of
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
is
the
growth
and
development
of
the
skills
and
talents
necessary
for
further
success
in

such
activities
can
help
students
find
new
ways
to
channel
their
energy
and
develop
talents
or
skills
in
a
positive
direction
additionally
engaging
in
extracurricular
activities
may
provide
invaluable
socialization
opportunities
and
help
expand
a
student
s
capacity
to
engage
with

backgrounds
furthermore
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
can
prove
important
to
avoiding
and
getting
out
of
trouble
for
instance
by
committing
to
structured
extracurricular
activities
students
are
less
likely
to
engage
in
activities
that
could
lead
to
trouble
or
harm
taking
part
in
extracurriculars
can
also
mitigate
the
risk
of
getting
involved
with
unsafe
peers
or
environments
it
s
essential
to
review
and
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
extracurricular
activities
before
committing
while
extracurricular
activities
can
be
a
source
of
development
and
enrichment
the
associated
time
and
effort
require
a
certain
level
of
commitment
from
students
meticulous
planning
and
sacrifices
regarding
leisure
and
sleep
amongst
others
as
an
artist
i
am
constantly
developing
and
honing
my
skills
to
create
something
beautiful
meaningful
and
authentic
to
be
able
to
do
this
well
i
have
had
to
develop
a
particular
talent
for
observing
the
world
around
me
and
using
my
creativity
to
transform
it
into
something
special
this
process
starts
when
i
take
notice
of
the
details
of
the
world
around
me
birds
singing
the
warmth
of
sun
on
my
skin
the
colors
of
the
evening
sky
and
is
then
translated
into
my
artwork
developing
and
using
this
skill
has
given
me
an
ability
to
capture
the
beauty
of
my
everyday
life
as
well
as
a
profound
appreciation
for
my
surroundings
knowing
how
to
spot
the
details
to
pay
attention
to
the
subtleties
of
nature
and
life
helps
me
to
craft
powerful
meaningful
pieces
that
express
my
true
self
in
addition
to
my
observation
skills
i
also
focus
on
the
skill
of
self expression
the
process
of
creating
a
piece
of
artwork
often
takes
me
into
a
mental
and
spiritual
place
where
i
can
express
more
complex
feelings
and
ideas
that
would
be
hard
to
convey
in
other
ways
this
form
of
self expression
allows
me
to
formerly
document
emotions
experiences
and
ideas
in
a
tangible
and
creative
way
that
can
be
shared
with
others
to
make
this
process
of
self expression
most
meaningful
i
try
to
explore
not
only
my
thoughts
and
feelings
but
also
my
values
goals
and
aspirations
drawing
upon
these
skills
have
allowed
me
to
make
some
truly
incredible
pieces
of
art
and
has
taught
me
to
appreciate
all
the
details
of
life
in
an
entirely
new
way
by
honing
my
observations
and
expressing
my
ideas
through
art
i
have
been
able
to
discover
my
true
self
and
make
a
strong
connection
to
my
life
and
the
world
around
me
many
people
are
debating
the
issue
of
whether
students
and
their
families
should
make
the
decision
about
extracurricular
involvement
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
for
leaving
the
decision
up
to
the
students
on
the
one
hand
students
may
be
able
to
more
easily
choose
activities
that
suit
their
needs
and
interests
leaving
more
time
for
other
hobbies
homework
and
studying
on
the
other
hand
students
may
not
be
able
to
make
the
best
decision
for
their
future
such
as
in
terms
of
gaining
potential
scholarships
or
possibly
feeling
overwhelmed
if
they
take
on
too
many
activities
additionally
students
may
feel
undue
pressure
from
peers
or
family
to
participate
in
certain
activities
raising
their
stress
levels
ultimately
the
decision
should
be
left
to
students
and
their
families
to
ensure
the
best
outcome
having
a
positive
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
beneficial
things
a
person
can
do
to
foster
success
and
growth
in
life
a
positive
attitude
can
help
build
upon
success
because
it
allows
for
setting
achievable
goals
encourages
healthy
communication
and
creates
an
optimistic
outlook
on
life
s
challenges
examples
of
how
a
positive
attitude
can
help
lead
to
success
are
seen
in
the
workplace
in
relationships
and
in
everyday
life
to
further
this
success
it
is
important
to
spend
time
with
positive
people
who
are
motivated
and
understanding
this
can
create
a
strong
support
system
for
one
s
growth
in
life
furthermore
it
is
important
to
show
respect
and
responsibility
to
others
in
order
to
achieve
success
not
only
this
but
treating
animals
with
care
and
kindness
can
also
help
a
person
realize
successes
and
happiness
in
life
all
these
elements
are
valuable
in
contributing
to
successful
and
positive
life
when
it
comes
to
success
failing
can
often
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
learning
tools
this
is
especially
true
for
students
striving
for
academic
excellence
take
for
example
a
student
struggling
in
a
science
class
this
student
may
not
have
understood
certain
concepts
or
had
difficulty
understanding
the
subject
matter
which
resulted
in
a
lower
grade
on
a
recent
test
rather
than
simply
giving
up
however
this
student
could
use
the
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
by
engaging
with
the
material
more
closely
gaining
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
science
concepts
and
finding
creative
ways
to
approach
the
material
the
student
can
ultimately
find
success
in
the
class
in
both
personal
and
professional
contexts
failure
can
be
an
important
part
of
paving
the
way
to
success
when
we
fail
we
can
look
at
the
experience
as
an
opportunity
to
explore
other
paths
and
develop
more
effective
strategies
it
can
also
be
a
chance
for
us
to
gain
perspective
and
become
more
resilient
to
disappointment
and
challenging
times
by
working
through
our
failures
we
can
build
confidence
in
our
abilities
to
eventually
achieve
success
ultimately
failure
is
inevitable
but
that
does
not
mean
it
has
to
be
a
negative
or
discouraging
experience
it
can
be
a
great
learning
tool
if
viewed
with
the
right
perspective
instead
of
letting
failure
be
an
obstacle
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
reflect
and
to
create
a
stronger
and
more
resilient
foundation
for
success
technology
can
be
seen
to
have
both
positive
and
negative
impacts
on
people
for
one
a
lack
of
communication
due
to
technology
can
result
in
feelings
of
isolation
anxiety
and
depression
it
can
also
be
easy
for
children
to
become
overly
obsessed
with
the
technology
around
them
leading
to
difficulty
focusing
in
school
and
sustained
feelings
of
restlessness
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
bring
many
benefits
to
people
s
lives
such
as
improved
work
schedules
and
more
efficient
shopping
experiences
in
the
medical
field
technology
has
proven
to
be
invaluable
with
many
life saving
advances
in
treatments
and
surgeries
technology
has
also
enabled
medical
professionals
to
quickly
diagnose
and
treat
illnesses
in
a
more
precise
and
time sensitive
manner
technology
can
be
a
force
for
both
good
and
bad
it
is
ultimately
up
to
individuals
to
ensure
that
they
are
using
technology
responsibly
and
appreciating
the
advantages
it
brings
to
our
lives
phones
are
a
great
way
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
outside
world
but
they
have
no
place
inside
a
school
building
during
class
hours
allowing
students
to
bring
their
phones
into
the
classroom
can
be
more
of
a
hindrance
than
a
help
during
school
hours
cell
phones
bring
potential
distractions
from
the
lesson
and
can
create
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
classroom
with
students
texting
friends
playing
games
and
checking
social
media
it
can
be
difficult
for
both
students
and
teachers
to
focus
on
the
class
syllabus
and
stay
on
task
having
phones
in
the
classroom
also
disrupts
the
learning
process
as
it
encourages
students
to
fall
into
a
multitasking
mindset responding
to
messages
or
notifications
when
they
should
instead
be
concentrating
on
the
lecture
although
phones
can
be
useful
in
a
classroom
setting
for
certain
activities
such
as
searching
for
information
or
taking
notes
the
potential
distraction
that
can
come
from
phones
should
not
be
allowed
to
disrupt
a
class
on
the
other
hand
having
phones
can
also
give
rise
to
cyberbullying
and
cheating
which
can
be
harmful
to
students
and
make
for
a
worse
learning
environment
ultimately
having
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
during
school
hours
is
more
of
a
hindrance
than
a
help
they
can
cause
noise
distraction
cyberbullying
and
cheating
for
these
reasons
student
should
not
be
allowed
to
bring
their
phones
into
the
classroom
is
a
virtue
that
is
often
overlooked
and
undervalued
in
society
it
can
be
difficult
to
trust
a
person
you
know
is
not
completely
honest
and
dishonesty
makes
it
difficult
for
relationships
whether
personal
or
professional
to
thrive
this
is
why
honesty
is
the
best
policy
in
almost
all
scenarios
given
that
honesty
is
the
foundation
of
trust
it
is
more
important
than
ever
to
be
honest
in
our
interactions
by
being
honest
we
establish
relationships
based
on
trust
and
mutual
respect
for
example
in
a
business
setting
if
you
can
be
honest
about
a
situation
or
outcome
regardless
of
the
consequences
it
will
yield
better
results
than
if
you
decide
to
be
dishonest
is
not
always
easy
but
it
is
always
the
best
course
of
action
in
personal
relationships
honesty
is
also
the
best
policy
we
all
have
experienced
betrayal
from
people
who
we
have
trusted
and
who
have
lied
to
us
knowing
that
a
person
is
honest
with
you
can
give
you
a
sense
of
peace
knowing
that
they
will
never
betray
you
in
relationships
can
help
people
grow
closer
to
one
another
as
it
encourages
open
conversations
and
mutual
understanding
in
summary
honesty
is
essential
for
forming
and
maintaining
relationships
both
personal
and
professional
by
being
honest
we
acknowledge
our
mistakes
and
learn
from
them
which
strengthens
our
character
also
leads
to
trust
and
respect
which
are
essential
components
of
any
healthy
relationship
was
a
philosopher
and
poet
whose
words
still
inspire
countless
individuals
to
achieve
greatness
in
particular
s
famous
quote
do
not
go
where
the
path
may
lead
go
instead
where
there
is
no
path
and
leave
a
trail
resonates
deeply
with
me
in
my
own
life
i
have
pushed
myself
to
take
risks
and
go
beyond
my
comfort
zone
to
achieve
success
for
example
during
my
studies
i
decided
to
enroll
in
an
advanced
course
even
though
i
had
little
prior
experience
in
the
subject
i
worked
hard
and
pushed
myself
beyond
my
expected
capabilities
and
eventually
i
achieved
success
this
experience
of
pushing
myself
to
achieve
success
reaffirms
s
quote
if
i
had
taken
the
easy
route
where
the
path
is
already
laid
out
i
would
not
have
had
the
same
level
of
success
taking
on
new
and
challenging
tasks
has
enabled
me
to
develop
unique
skills
and
strategies
to
better
equip
myself
in
the
future
ultimately
i
have
come
to
realize
the
importance
of
trying
and
pushing
oneself
in
order
to
achieve
greater
heights
of
success
as
i
reflect
on
my
life
one
moment
of
failure
stands
out
above
the
rest
it
was
when
i
failed
my
college
entrance
exam
a
situation
which
had
serious
consequences
on
my
life
i
had
been
focused
on
getting
a
good
score
on
my
college
entrance
exam
for
many
years
and
it
felt
devastating
to
know
that
all
my
hard
work
had
been
for
nothing
at
the
time
i
was
overwhelmed
with
emotions i
was
embarrassed
disappointed
and
discouraged
but
something
kept
me
going the
words
of
wisdom
from
who
famously
said
adversity
can
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
it
was
this
quote
and
my
determination
to
keep
pushing
forward
that
kept
me
from
letting
my
failure
define
me
so
instead
of
giving
up
i
chose
to
refocus
my
energy
and
use
my
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
because
of
my
perseverance
i
found
other
ways
to
get
into
college
and
eventually
picked
up
a
few
new
skills
from
that
experience
i
learned
that
hardships
can
actually
be
an
opportunity
for
us
to
get
to
know
ourselves
better
and
that
failures
are
a
necessary
part
of
human
growth
it
taught
me
to
look
for
the
learning
opportunities
when
things
don
t
go
the
way
i
planned
and
to
not
be
afraid
in
the
face
of
adversity
overall
i
m
grateful
for
this
moment
of
failure
because
it
enabled
me
to
grow
in
ways
that
i
would
have
otherwise
not
been
able
to
do
it
was
thanks
to
the
words
of
wisdom
from
that
kept
me
from
letting
my
failure
define
me
instead
encouraging
me
to
persevere
and
turn
my
circumstances
into
something
positive
being
able
to
choose
your
own
character
is
an
incredibly
important
part
of
life
having
the
freedom
to
define
yourself
and
express
your
individual
worldview
gives
you
the
confidence
to
pursue
your
goals
and
express
your
true
self
to
those
around
you
without
it
you
can
feel
limited
in
your
opportunities
to
achieve
success
and
your
self identity
can
become
blurred
with
those
of
those
around
you
by
having
the
freedom

choose
your

character
you
can
take
control
of
your

create
a
strong
identity
that
you
feel
comfortable
expressing
being
able

express
your
true
self
to
other
individuals
is
also
vitally
important
without
the
freedom
to
choose
your
own
character
it
can
be
difficult
to
trust
yourself
and
be
able
to
open
up
to
others
if
you
don
t
have
the
opportunity
to
express
the
different
traits
and
characteristics
of
your
character
it
can
be
difficult
to
connect
and
engage
with
others
around
you
overall
having
the
freedom
to
choose
your

character
is
incredibly
important
it

you
the
confidence

planting
trees
in
schools
is
an
incredibly
important
and
beneficial
act
on
a
basic
level
trees
offer
shade
beautify
the
school
grounds
provide
privacy
for
outdoor
learning

activities
act
as
a
barrier
to
reduce
noise

absorb
air
pollution
and
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
serve
as
a
natural
defense
against
floods
water
runoff
and
soil

trees
are
also
a
low cost
and
easy
way
to
create
a
peaceful
and
calming
atmosphere
on
campus
allowing
for
better
focus
and
better
learning
for
students
from
a
personal
standpoint
i
have
always
taken
it
as
part
of
my
duty
to
protect
trees
on
school
grounds
i
have
experienced
first hand
the
calming
effect
of
being
among
the
branches
and
the
joy
of
communing
with
nature
while
many
of
the
environmental
benefits
of
trees
in
the
school
are
systematic
it
is
equally
important
to
recognize
their
ability
to
improve
mental
and
emotional
wellbeing
in
students
faculty
and
the
extended
community
we
have
to
ensure
that
trees
are
respected
and
protected
so
that
we
and
future
generations
can
enjoy
their
awesome
beauty
with
the
rise
of
digital
technologies
online
courses
offer
unparalleled
flexibility
to
students
of
all
ages
on
the
upside
online
courses
offer
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
access
course
material
any
time
of
day
and
from
anywhere
they
are
generally
more
affordable
than
traditional
classes
since
tuition
fees
are
often
lower
and
they
don
t
require
students
to
pay
additional
fees
for
resources
such
as
textbooks
materials
or
transportation
in
addition
the
amount
of
time
required
to
complete
online
courses
is
generally
shorter
than
it
would
be
for
in person
courses
however
there
is
one
big
downside
to
online
courses
limited
social
interaction
while
online
courses
offer
students
the
ability
to
interact
with
their
peers
and
instructors
through
emails
forums
and
chat
rooms
these
interactions
can
feel
impersonal
and
shallow
compared
to
the
interactive
nature
of
face to face
learning
on
the
other
hand
attending
traditional
classes
at
a
school
allows
for
a
much
more
rich
social
environment
through
in person
learning
students
have
the
opportunity
to
engage
directly
with
instructors
and
ask
questions
as
needed
formstudy
groups
and
participate
in
activities
and
field
trips
also
by
attending
traditional
classes
students
gain
invaluable
professional
experience
that
will
increase
their
exposure
and
help
them
build
their
resume
when
it
comes
to
the
financial
investment
attending
traditional
classes
could
cost
more
upfront
due
to
tuition
fees
materials
and
other
costs
however
the
payoffs
could
potentially
be
higher
if
the
student
decides
to
pursue
a
career
in
the
field
covered
by
that
particular
course
on
the
other
hand
with
online
courses
the
initial
upfront
cost
might
be
lower
however
students
should
remember
that
they
will
need
to
invest
in
reliable
internet
access
in
order
to
successfully
complete
the
course
ultimately
the
decision
about
whether
to
choose
online
courses
or
attend
traditional
classes
at
a
school
depends
on
individual
preferences
and
financial
situations
while
online
courses
have
the
potential
to
save
students
money
in
the
short term
traditional
classes
offer
the
advantages
of
professional
development
and
social
interaction
small
acts
of
kindness
have
the
power
to
positively
impact
a
person
s
beliefs
emotions
and
behavior
defined
as
the
quality
of
being
friendly
generous
and
considerate
is
an
integral
part
of
promoting
peace
between
individuals
as
well
as
peace
within
the
world
firstly
small
acts
of
kindness
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
people
s
happiness
and
mental
health
an
act
of
kindness
could
be
as
small
as
a
smile
to
a
stranger
in
the
street
or
sending
a
thoughtful
card
to
a
friend
studies
have
shown
that
acts
of
benevolence
can
increase
one
s
happiness
as
it
is
linked
to
the
release
of
dopamine
a
hormone
our
body
releases
when
feeling
pleasure
through
kindness
we
can
bring
joy
to
people
s
lives
even
if
it
s
in
the
simplest
of
ways
another
way
that
kindness
can
have
an
impact
is
on
one
s
safety
oftentimes
people
feel
scared
or
uncomfortable
when
faced
with
unfamiliar
situations
this
is
where
many
gestures
of
kindness
such
as
lending
a
helping
hand
while
crossing
a
street
or
offering
advice
in
times
of
stress
can
make
a
difference
by
showing
kindness
and
care
to
others
we
help
establish
a
feeling
of
mutual
safety
that
will
improve
all
our
lives
thirdly
the
health
benefits
of
thinking
and
acting
kindly
are
both
physical
and
mental
as
we
spread
kindness
around
us
we
can
experience
an
improved
cardiovascular
health
a
decrease
in
abdominal
fat
an
improvement
in
our
immune
system
and
much
more
additionally
being
kind
can
reduce
symptoms
of
depression
and
anxiety
being
kind
not
only
helps
us
to
build
strong
relationships
but
also
can
build
a
physically
and
mentally
healthy
life
finally
kindness
can
also
have
an
impact
on
people
s
feelings
of
anger
and
aggression
when
we
act
kindly
towards
those
around
us
we
promote
understanding
tolerance
and
acceptance
which
also
help
to
reduce
aggression
in
individuals
and
communities
in
conclusion
small
acts
of
kindness
though
simple
have
an
incredible
ripple
effect
on
people
and
have
the
power
to
shape
relationships
unite
cultures
and
bring
peace
is
something
that
can
be
shared
and
embraced
regardless
of
our
background
and
it
is
the
key
to
finding
a
more
harmonious
and
understanding
world
in
today
s
world
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
it
has
allowed
us
to
stay
connected
with
friends
and
family
even
from
great
distances
technology
has
given
us
the
tools
to
make
lasting
memories
access
information
that
was
unavailable
to
us
in
the
past
and
make
plans
with
ease
additionally
technology
has
had
a
positive
impact
on
our
financial
lives
from
allowing
people
to
shop
and
book
flights
with
ease
to
providing
inventive
opportunities
for
new
businesses
to
be
created
technology
has
made
financial
transactions
more
efficient
than
ever
before
people
can
also
obtain
resources
faster
than
ever
from
a
variety
of
different
sources
on
the
other
hand
technology
also
presents
some
drawbacks
privacy
concerns
have
been
brought
to
the
forefront
and
individuals
are
actively
taking
steps
to
protect
their
personal
information
from
being
exposed
it
has
also
had
serious
implications
on
people
s
social
lives
from
social
media
addiction
to
potentially
harmful
interactions
such
as
cyberbullying
finally
technology
can
be
used
both
legally
and
illegally
and
it
is
important
to
be
aware
of
the
consequences
of
misuse
while
there
are
potential
risks
associated
with
technology
it
has
certainly
been
beneficial
to
humanity
in
many
ways
with
proper
precautions
technology
can
continue
to
be
used
in
beneficial
ways
for
the
benefit
of
all
spending
time
outdoors
with
friends
can
be
an
incredibly
enjoyable
experience
many
areas
offer
a
variety
of
outdoor
activities
to
explore
and
the
affordability
commitment
length
and
amount
of
fun
can
vary
quite
a
bit
for
example
a
day
hiking
trip
requires
fewer
supplies
and
a
much
shorter
commitment
than
a
weekend
camping
trip
but
the
two
activities
have
a
lot
of
potential
for
fun
the
cost
of
outdoor
activities
when
combined
with
friends
can
even
become
quite
affordable
when
friends
are
around
there
is
an
extra
level
of
comfort
and
safety
that
can
be
hard
to
replicate
when
spending
time
outdoors
alone
by
having
friends
around
it
is
much
easier
to
share
troubles
and
talk
through
problems
that
may
be
on
your
mind
additionally
it
s
always
great
to
have
a
buddy
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
nature
with
sharing
outdoor
experiences
with
friends
can
create
connections
or
memories
that
can
last
a
lifetime
in
conclusion
spending
time
outdoors
with
friends
offers
a
wide
variety
of
advantages
not
only
is
it
a
great
way
to
escape
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
daily
life
but
it
also
provides
an
opportunity
to
share
experiences
work
through
issues
appreciate
nature
and
make
memories
no
matter
how
one
decides
to
spend
time
with
friends
in
the
great
outdoors
the
experience
is
sure
to
be
unforgettable
the
debate
between
nature
versus
nurture
in
determining
our
character
traits
is
one
that
has
long
been
discussed
and
it
is
difficult
to
come
to
a
right
or
wrong
conclusion
it
is
generally
accepted
that
both
biological
and
environmental
influences
play
a
role
in
the
way
we
are
the
way
we
treat
people
and
the
way
we
tell
ourselves
to
be
biological
influences
such
as
our
genetic
makeup
play
an
important
role
in
how
we
have
been
hardwired
on
the
other
hand
environmental
influences
such
as
our
upbringing
the
people
around
us
and
our
experiences
often
shape
the
way
we
think
and
behave
ultimately
it
is
likely
that
a
combination
of
both
nature
and
nurture
are
what
contributes
to
our
character
while
we
are
born
with
certain
traits
based
on
our
genetics
these
traits
can
be
shaped
and
molded
by
the
people
and
experiences
in
our
lives
our
outlook
on
life
and
the
actions
we
choose
to
take
are
shaped
by
forces
outside
our
control
including
our
environment
and
the
people
around
us
similarly
our
sense
of
self
and
how
we
interact
with
the
world
is
greatly
impacted
by
the
standards
and
expectations
of
the
society
we
are
raised
in
though
definitive
answers
remain
elusive
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
both
our
genetic
makeup
and
our
environment
contribute
to
our
character
our
individual
traits
have
been
deeply
affected
by
the
experiences
and
behaviours
we
have
been
exposed
to
while
also
relying
on
the
biological
foundations
we
have
been
given
understanding
the
complexities
of
this
relationship
can
help
us
to
better
understand
ourselves
and
how
our
character
is
formed
when
it
comes
to
making
decisions
it
is
essential
for
individuals
to
take
ownership
in
the
process
making
decisions
on
one
s
own
allows
for
active
decision making
allowing
individuals
to
be
confident
in
their
choices
and
gain
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
the
outcome
there
are
several
advantageous
reasons
why
people
should
make
their
own
decisions
firstly
it
helps
people
develop
critical
thinking
skills
and
encourages
them
to
take
chances
and
be
creative
secondly
it
allows
individuals
to
gain
self confidence
and
trust
in
their
own
ability
to
make
decisions
being
able
to
make
decisions
for
oneself
is
a
valuable
asset
in
life
and
leads
to
increased
autonomy
responsibility
and
stability
ultimately
making
one
s
own
decisions
is
an
essential
way
for
individuals
to
exercise
their
agency
as
many
successful
individuals
have
attested
success
does
not
have
to
be
the
result
of
failure
despite
the
often used
phrase
failure
leads
to
success
there
are
in
fact
alternate
routes
to
success
that
don
t
involve
failure
to
understand
how
one
can
proceed
towards
success
without
defeatedly
accepting
the
outcome
of
failure
it
is
first
important
to
grasp
what
each
path
of
success
involves
there
are
three
main
paths
to
success
the
traditional
path
of
failing
and
learning
the
path
of
recognition
as
a
success
without
failure
and
the
path
of
breaking
away
from
traditional
success
through
failure
the
traditional
path
to
success
is
the
belief
that
failure
is
part
of
the
learning
process
and
that
one
should
use
their
mistakes
to
move
forward
this
tends
to
be
the
most
common
route
for
success
it
involves
people
accepting
their
failures
as
part
of
the
journey
and
using
them
as
learning
points
or
guidance
along
the
way
however
it
is
not
necessary
to
accept
failure
as
part
of
the
journey
to
success
as
a
success
without
failure
involves
innovation
and
doing
something
that
isn
t
traditionally
understood
as
a
successful
path
for
example
an
actor
rejected
from
an
audition
may
take
up
an
instructional
class
or
direct
his
own
film
which
could
potentially
lead
to
more
recognition
and
fame
than
if
he
had
simply
followed
the
traditional
success
path
finally
there
s
the
option
to
break
away
from
traditional
paths
to
success
altogether
this
often
involves
creative
endeavors
like
painting
poetry
and
music
in
which
failure
is
not
necessarily
seen
as
something
negative
in
this
route
success
is
n t
measured
in
how
well
one
improves
from
a
mistake
but
it
s
success
for
the
idea
or
vision
in
itself
thus
it
is
possible
to
reach
success
without
feeling
the
need
to
accept
failure
whether
it
s
through
a
certain
type
of
recognition
breaking
away
from
traditional
paths
or
any
other
creative
routes
there
are
multiple
ways
towards
success
without
defeat
through
determination
and
access
to
necessary
resources
one
can
bypass
the
expected
notion
that
failure
leads
to
success
and
achieve
their
goals
through
alternative
paths
working
in
a
team
can
be
a
beneficial
endeavor
for
many
reasons
studies
have
shown
that
when
individuals
are
part
of
a
team
they
are
more
likely
to
have
better
ideas
and
more
efficient
outcomes
being
in
a
collaborative
environment
can
encourage
creativity
foster
open
communication
and
provide
an
opportunity
to
mentor
and
learn
from
each
other
when
working
in
a
team
members
different
skills
experiences
and
backgrounds
can
be
applied
to
the
task
at
hand
having
diverse
perspectives
can
help
to
create
and
develop
innovative
ideas
and
solutions
working
in
a
team
also
allows
individuals
to
use
their
individual
strengths
to
their
advantage
creating
a
powerful
combination
to
benefit
the
team
team
work
also
promotes
shared
responsibility
and
understanding
when
each
individual
in
a
team
has
a
role
to
play
the
risk
of
failure
is
reduced
if
the
task
isn
t
accomplished
the
entire
team
will
work
together
to
find
a
solution
additionally
working
in
groups
encourages
members
to
become
better
listeners
and
communicators
which
can
improve
not
only
the
task
at
hand
but
also
relationships
between
team
members
in
conclusion
working
in
a
team
provides
many
benefits
that
can
not
be
gained
working
alone
working
with
a
diverse
set
of
individuals
can
lead
to
better
ideas
enhanced
productivity
and
improved
team
dynamics
when
tasks
are
shared
and
each
individual
does
their
part
amazing
results
can
be
achieved
therefore
the
advantages
of
working
together
far
outweigh
the
benefits
of
working
alone
as
the
world
of
technology
advances
more
and
more
schools
are
turning
to
cell
phones
for
educational
purposes
integrating
cell
phones
into
schoolwork
can
be
a
great
way
to
engage
students
and
allow
them
to
explore
their
learning
in
a
more
interactive
way
however
the
potential
negative
effects
of
using
cell
phones
for
educational
purposes
must
also
be
considered
there
have
been
reports
of
students
relying
too
much
on
technology
to
complete
academic
tasks
as
well
as
instances
of
students
becoming
easily
distracted
by
their
phones
in
the
classroom
in
addition
the
effects
of
using
cell
phones
for
educational
purposes
have
yet
to
be
determined
and
could
have
a
lasting
impact
on
the
students
overall
learning
there
are
ways
to
keep
students
focused
while
still
encouraging
cell
phone
use
for
learning
educators
can
set
guidelines
about
acceptable
and
inappropriate
use
of
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
letting
students
know
when
phone
use
is
and
is
not
appropriate
discussions
activities
and
group
work
can
also
help
keep
students
on
task
additionally
setting
expectations
for
when
and
how
students
can
use
their
phones
can
help
ensure
phones
are
being
used
in
a
productive
and
educational
manner
ultimately
research
is
needed
to
determine
how
integrating
cell
phones
for
educational
purposes
affects
the
students
overall
learning
and
more
initiatives
must
be
taken
in
order
to
properly
assess
the
long term
implications
of
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
for
many
students
and
teachers
a
four day
school
week
has
numerous
benefits
the
time
saved
on
a
long
commute
or
trip
to
school
can
be
used
for
more
productive
endeavors
parents
and
students
alike
can
save
money
and
time
on
gas
costs
to
and
from
school
additionally
having
fewer
required
school
days
in
a
week
gives
teachers
and
students
more
time
to
focus
on
their
studies
and
extracurriculars
for
students
a
four day
school
week
can
be
particularly
beneficial
in
regards
to
their
education
instead
of
feeling
overwhelmed
with
a
full
day
of
classes
teachers
can
have
additional
time
for
lectures
and
activities
which
can
help
students
understanding
having
an
extra
day
off
provides
opportunities
for
students
to
spend
more
time
on
their
homework
furthering
their
education
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
school
allows
students
more
time
for
extracurricular
activities
the
completion
of
long term
projects
and
exploring
areas
of
interest
moreover
by
taking
advantage
of
the
additional
day
off
students
can
seek
out
help
in
areas
of
difficulty
or
get
ahead
on
upcoming
assignments
teachers
also
benefit
greatly
from
having
the
extra
day
off
this
time
can
be
used
for
professional
development
lesson
planning
or
grading
with
fewer
required
school
days
in
a
week
teachers
can
create
and
redesign
curricula
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
students
having
additional
time
off
provides
necessary
breathing
room
and
can
reduce
stress
and
burn out
a
four day
school
week
can
provide
considerable
benefits
for
everyone
involved
redirecting
resources
saved
from
fewer
school
days
to
academic
instruction
can
help
to
enhance
the
education
of
students
and
teachers
can
take
advantage
of
the
extra
time
off
and
use
it
to
better
plan
and
acquire
new
skills
ultimately
a
four day
school
week
can
provide
the
much needed
time
necessary
for
homework
seeking
help
and
investing
in
the
community
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
students
studying
from
home
are
varied
and
complex
in
terms
of
physical
interaction
access
to
resources
and
how
it
can
affect
future
goals
distance
learning
can
be
either
helpful
or
detrimental
for
example
students
can
find
it
isolating
and
lacking
in
social
support
while
they
can
also
benefit
from
having
more
autonomy
and
freedom
of
access
to
resources
if
they
are
given
the
right
tools
and
facilities
additionally
the
cost
of
providing
physical
resources
such
as
laptops
and
tablets
for
all
students
can
be
prohibitive
there
is
also
the
potential
for
increased
anxiety
or
decreased
trust
between
students
if
teachers
can
not
adequately
monitor
their
progress
online
as
evidence
suggests
higher
levels
of
cheating
and
plagiarism
occur
in
distance
learning
scenarios
schools
can
work
to
improve
distance
learning
by
offering
structured
systems
such
as
virtual
collaboration
tools
online
lecture
materials
and
feedback
systems
to
motivate
students
to
learn
it
is
important
for
teachers
to
build
meaningful
connections
with
them
by
providing
frequent
and
constructive
feedback
on
their
work
teachers
can
also
motivate
students
by
setting
both
short
and
long term
goals
that
can
be
built
into
assignments
and
tests
as
well
as
providing
extra curricular
activities
such
as
virtual
field
trips
guest
lectures
or
online
meetings
with
industry
professionals
ultimately
students
should
work
on
school
assignments
from
home
if
they
feel
it
is
beneficial
and
if
their
school
is
offering
a
comprehensive
program
for
distance
learning
it
is
important
that
both
schools
and
students
are
prepared
with
the
right
tools
and
resources
to
facilitate
successful
distance
learning
with
the
proper
systems
in
place
distance
learning
can
be
an
effective
method
for
students
to
further
their
education
and
make
progress
towards
their
goals
attending
school
is
a
defining
portion
of
a
student
s
life
and
comes
with
numerous
benefits
and
challenges
schooling
offers
an
impressive
array
of
accessibility
options
and
allows
for
greater
convenience
however
some
of
the
difficulties
that
can
encourage
students
to
attend
classes
usually
decrease
students
who
opt
for
online
classes
might
save
a
lot
of
time
in
commute
but
can
miss
out
on
the
extracurricular
peer
engagement
that
schools
provide
from
a
physical
mental
and
psychological
perspective
attending
school
provides
essential
social
skill
development
and
educational
opportunities
that
simply
can
not
be
replicated
in
an
online
environment
immigrants
can
also
benefit
from
attending
school
due
to
specialized
programs
such
as
these
programs
enhance
language
capabilities
and
offer
essential
educational
resources
to
those
students
who
otherwise
might
not
have
those
opportunities
classes
allow
immigrants
to
thrive
inside
of
a
school
setting
which
helps
them
to
prepare
for
their
upcoming
lives
in
the
states
attending
school
has
great
importance
for
immigrants
since
it
serves
as
a
bridge
to
a
brighter
future
and
motivation
are
two
of
the
most
powerful
tools
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
even
in
the
face
of
failure
take
for
example
who
famously
said
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
won
t
work
this
is
an
example
of
the
determination
and
passion
with
which
approached
his
work
refusing
to
let
failure
keep
him
from
achieving
greatness
though
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
well known
examples
of
success
despite
failure
this
concept
can
be
seen
in
the
stories
of
many
people
from
all
walks
of
life
take
who
failed
to
gain
entrance
to
his
dream
college
yet
still
went
on
to
become
one
of
the
wealthiest
people
in
the
world
or
who
was
expelled
from
college
but
was
able
to
take
his
genius
to
the
very
top
of
the
business
world
creating
a
successful
innovative
and
disruptive
company
these
examples
demonstrate
just
how
powerful
enthusiasm
and
motivation
can
be no
matter
how
many
times
you
fail
if
you
pick
yourself
up
and
keep
going
with
passion
and
commitment
anything
is
possible
it
is
clear
then
that
while
failure
may
be
inevitable
it
is
never
the
end
of
the
story
with
an
attitude
of
enthusiasm
and
motivation
any
individual
can
achieve
greatness
and
success
regardless
of
the
obstacles
in
their
way
is
a
beautiful
country
with
its
own
unique
culture
holidays
and
food
education
is
highly
valued
in
with
students
generally
attending

from

to
age
before
moving

the
largest
museum
in

the
museum

which
contains
thousands
of
artifacts
from
the

ancient
artifacts
to
pieces
of

from
more
recent
eras
there
is
something
for
everyone
in
this
museum

the
this
iconic
tower
is
over
metres
tall
and
is
visible
from
almost
anywhere
in
the
city
it
is
one
of
the
most
recognizable
landmarks
in
and
has
been
a
tourist
destination
since
the
century
programs
that
pair
older
and
younger
students
together
can
be
an
effective
way
of
helping
students
in
the
areas
of
social
adjustment
understanding
new
classes
and
forming
better
study
habits
benefits
of
these
programs
include
helping
younger
students
foster
positive
relationships
with
their
peers
as
well
as
providing
guidance
and
mentorship
through
experienced
upperclassmen
furthermore
these
programs
can
be
used
as
a
space
in
which
students
can
develop
beneficial
communication
and
problem solving
skills
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
disadvantages
to
these
programs
such
as
potential
feelings
of
intimidation
or
jealousy
for
younger
students
in
the
presence
of
their
older
peers
some
students
may
be
resistant
when
they
have
been
placed
in
a
mentor mentee
relationship
with
someone
who
is
unfamiliar
to
them
when
implemented
appropriately
these
types
of
school
programs
can
be
of
great
benefit
to
students
in
aiding
academic
achievement
by
forming
these
mentor mentee
partnerships
younger
students
can
receive
assistance
in
areas
like
homework
help
exam
preparation
and
overcoming
academic
obstacles
it
is
also
an
opportunity
for
students
to
develop
confidence
resilience
and
self sufficiency
overall
these
programs
offer
unique
and
valuable
experiences
for
students
in
the
form
of
educational
support
and
personal
development
working
in
a
group
can
be
beneficial
in
an
academic
setting
as
it
allows
for
increased
collaboration
creativity
and
new
perspectives
by
discussing
tasks
researching
topics
or
completing
tasks
together
it
can
significantly
increase
the
quality
and
efficiency
of
the
work
for
example
if
working
on
a
group
project
in
an
introduction
to
class
different
members
can
bring
their
unique
viewpoints
and
perspectives
allowing
the
final
project
to
be
more
comprehensive
and
creative
than
if
one
student
had
completed
the
project
alone
however
there
can
be
drawbacks
to
working
in
a
group
in
addition
to
the
potential
challenge
of
coordinating
schedules
and
meeting
times
other
issues
can
arise
such
as
potential
discrepancies
between
the
amount
of
work
each
person
contributes
and
the
weight
of
each
member
s
contribution
this
could
lead
to
conflict
and
a
less
than
ideal
outcome
for
example
if
two
people
in
a
group
are
especially
invested
in
a
project
but
the
other
two
contribute
little
effort
the
final
result
could
be
negatively
impacted
in
conclusion
although
working
in
an
academic
setting
with
a
group
can
be
beneficial
in
several
ways
the
potential
issues
within
the
group
may
outweigh
any
potential
benefits
in
some
cases
when
i
first
met
my
good
friend
of
five
years
i
was
immediately
put
off
by
her
aggressive
attitude
and
brash
personality
i
was
tempted
to
write
her
off
as
not
worth
my
time
and
leave
but
i
decided
to
give
her
another
chance
i
m
glad
i
did
because
when
i
gave
her
a
second
chance
to
make
an
impression
i
was
relieved
to
find
she
was
actually
a
kind
and
compassionate
person
in
that
moment
i
realized
the
importance
of
considering
second
impressions
rather
than
relying
on
first
impressions
when
meeting
someone
for
the
first
time
by
giving
my
friend
a
chance
to
make
a
second
impression
i
was
able
to
get
to
know
her
and
establish
a
long lasting
friendship
this
experience
reinforced
my
belief
that
it
is
important
to
consider
second
impressions
even
when
first
impressions
may
not
be
favorable
failure
can
be
an
intimidating
concept
for
many
yet
it
is
essential
to
our
growth
as
people
we
must
acknowledge
that
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
life
and
that
it
can
be
used
to
become
a
successful
person
it
is
a
key
factor
that
should
be
embraced
as
a
means
of
learning
from
our
mistakes
and
focussing
on
our
development
despite
this
there
are
still
those
who
maintain
that
it
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
from
my
own
experience
failure
has
been
a
key
contributor
to
my
success
as
a
person
as
a
student
it
was
only
upon
getting
a
failing
grade
on
an
assignment
that
i
understood
the
importance
of
studying
thoroughly
and
engaging
deeply
with
every
learning
module
this
in
turn
gave
me
the
motivation
to
ensure
that
i
take
responsibility
for
my
actions
and
perform
to
a
higher
level
in
this
sense
failure
had
provided
me
the
extra
push
to
strive
towards
bettering
myself
however
there
are
still
those
who
feel
that
failure
should
be
shied
away
from
in
order
to
maintain
a
feeling
of
invincibility
it
can
be
difficult
to
come
to
terms
with
failure
since
it
often
serves
as
a
reminder
of
our
own
personal
shortcomings
yet
it
is
only
through
embracing
failure
that
we
can
truly
grow
and
become
better
versions
of
ourselves
in
the
end
it
is
up
to
each
of
us
to
determine
how
we
confront
failure
and
learn
from
it
whether
it
is
seen
as
an
opportunity
for
growth
or
a
sign
of
defeat
is
ultimately
in
our
hands
we
should
recognize
the
fact
that
failure
is
an
essential
part
of
life
and
that
it
can
be
used
to
become
successful
only
then
is
it
possible
to
tap
into
our
potential
and
strive
for
greater
heights
in
our
lives
i
have
a
unique
artistic
talent
that
sets
me
well
apart
from
others
and
i
should
share
it
with
the
world
i
have
always
had
a
gift
for
painting
and
drawing
something
that
has
been
passed
down
to
me
through
generations
of
my
family
i
can
create
beautiful
detailed
works
of
art
on
both
canvas
and
paper
and
this
ability
has
been
nurtured
through
my
time
spent
in
art
classes
and
workshops
painting
and
drawing
has
been
a
source
of
gratification
and
joy
throughout
my
life
so
i
should
share
my
gift
with
the
world
and
use
it
as
a
tool
to
bring
a
little
more
beauty
and
creativity
into
people
s
everyday
lives
i
believe
that
i
can
reach
others
with
my
art
and
inspire
them
to
be
more
creative
to
try
their
own
hand
at
painting
or
drawing
or
simply
to
appreciate
the
beauty
that
is
found
in
art
in
a
world
filled
with
technology
and
stress
it
is
refreshing
to
have
the
opportunity
to
focus
on
more
creative
passions
my
artistic
talent
is
something
that
i
should
not
take
for
granted
and
hopefully
by
sharing
it
with
the
world
i
can
help
to
make
a
positive
impact

used
online

to
research
more
about
character
traits

discovered
that
these
traits
are
often
known
as
the
agreeable
type
they
are
beneficial
as
these
traits
help
me
build
relationships
with
people
i
ve
also
considered
my
behavior
in
different
social
situations
and
determined
which
personality
type
best
fits
those
situations
for
example
when
meeting
new
people
my
friendly
and
compassionate
nature
comes
in
handy
in
difficult
situations

rely
on
my
reliability
to
get
me

reflecting
on
the
traits
i
possess
and
thinking
about
how

people
who
can
be
trusted
to
get
the
job
done
their
enthusiasm
and
optimistic
outlook
allow
them
to
think
positively
when
faced
with
challenges
and
difficult
tasks
they
are
also
able
to
motivate
others
to
take
on
difficult
tasks
and
are
often
successful
in
team
environments
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
achieving
success
in
life
it
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
how
we
perceive
the
world
and
can
lead
to
greater
emotional
social
and
physical
wellbeing
those
who

attitude
are
more
likely
to
find
success
in
their
personal
and
professional
spheres
and
are
seen
as
reliable
and
trustworthy
people
working
with
a
group
can
offer
a
number
of
benefits
sharing
the
workload
can
make
for
a
more
efficient
use
of
time
and
resources
as
well
as
providing
multiple
perspectives
and
increasing
creativity
working
as
part
of
a
team
can
also
lead
to
better
communication
and
collaboration
skills
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
advantages
to
working
alone
without
the
need
to
coordinate
schedules
or
consider
the
needs
of
others
you
have
the
freedom
to
organize
and
structure
time
in
whatever
way
you
feel
is
most
productive
for
you
you
are
able
to
devote
full
attention
and
concentration
to
your
task
until
it
is
completed
leading
to
better
quality
of
work
additionally
working
alone
can
often
provide
a
greater
sense
of
autonomy
and
creativity
working
with
a
group
can
be
menacing
and
rewarding
in
equal
measure
on
one
hand
it
has
the
advantage
of
providing
ideas
resources
and
support
allowing
individuals
to
learn
and
gain
insight
from
one
another
this
synergistic
relationship
allows
people
to
become
their
best
but
can
also
lead
to
a
feeling
of
being
overwhelmed
working
alone
has
the
advantage
of
freeing
an
individual
from
feeling
the
pressure
of
being
a
part
of
a
collective
and
allows
them
to
steer
their
own
course
without
feeling
like
they
have
to
meet
anyone
else
s
expectations
at
the
same
time
working
alone
can
be
isolating
and
lonely
with
individuals
surrounded
only
by
their
own
thoughts
and
beliefs
if
left
unchecked
this
can
lead
to
the
erosion
of
one
s
personality
and
social
relationships
making
it
hard
to
interact
with
others
when
the
situation
calls
for
it
working
as
a
group
can
be
beneficial
in
difficult
situations
because
it
allows
people
the
opportunity
to
pull
together
in
times
of
need
utilizing
a
collective
knowledge
base
to
get
the
job
done
efficiently
and
effectively
this
also
ties
in
with
the
importance
of
friendship
and
respect
within
a
group
allowing
individuals
to
understand
and
appreciate
one
another
creating
a
culture
that
is
both
cordial
and
productive
in
conclusion
there
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
working
with
a
group
and
working
alone
but
it
is
important
to
examine
the
implications
of
each
carefully
and
decide
which
method
is
best
suited
for
the
task
at
hand
while
it
may
be
tempting
to
stay
isolated
there
are
undoubtedly
great
rewards
to
be
found
in
working
as
a
part
of
a
collective
and
the
strength
and
support
it
provides
can
be
invaluable
deciding
to
pursue
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
have
numerous
advantages
for
one
by
the
time
a
student
graduates
high
school
they
will
have
a
greater
understanding
of
the
career
path
they
chose
giving
them
an
edge
in
future
job
prospects
furthermore
committing
to
a
career
from
an
early
stage
allows
students
to
begin
sharpening
their
skills
early
on
and
develop
fluency
in
the
field
they
wish
to
work
in
at
the
same
time
one
must
consider
the
amount
of
time
and
effort
a
student
may
need
to
dedicate
in
order
to
find
the
right
career
path
without
enough
guidance
and
support
young
students
could
easily
become
disillusioned
or
intimidated
by
the
choices
that
are
available
to
them
despite
this
research
has
shown
that
the
key
to
success
in
life
is
rooted
in
how
well
one
prepares
at
a
young
age
making
the
decision
to
commit
to
a
career
early
on
will
allow
for
more
time
to
gain
the
knowledge
and
skills
necessary
to
become
successful
therefore
choosing
a
career
before
graduating
high
school
is
arguably
one
of
the
best
ways
to
ensure
career
success
in
the
future
having
taken
both
mandatory
and
elective
courses
in
the
arts
during
my
high
school
career
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
experience
and
consider
the
benefits
of
such
courses
from
both
perspectives
when
i
went
into
my
mandatory
classes
there
was
an
initial
reluctance
to
engage
with
the
material
as
i
felt
like
i
was
being
forced
to
do
something
that
i
hadn
t
initially
asked
for
however
once
i
actually
put
in
the
work
i
soon
started
to
see
the
true
beauty
of
the
world
that
i
had
previously
been
oblivious
to
taking
a
mandatory
course
in
the
arts
provided
me
with
an
outlet
to
express
my
creativity
through
the
classes
i
was
able
to
develop
my
own
skills
and
connect
with
my
peers
in
ways
i
had
not
previously
had
the
opportunity
to
explore
on
the
other
hand
i
had
the
chance
to
take
art
classes
as
an
elective
which
allowed
me
to
tailor
my
experience
to
fit
my
specific
interests
i
could
choose
between
different
media
to
use
and
the
subject
matter
that
suited
my
style
and
creative
expression
these
classes
provided
me
with
a
unique
and
enjoyable
learning
experience
that
i
could
effectively
carry
and
apply
in
my
career
preparation
ultimately
i
believe
that
providing
students
with
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
art
classes
both
as
a
mandatory
and
elective
is
beneficial
not
only
does
it
encourage
a
more
engaging
and
creative
class
environment
it
can
lead
to
improved
test
scores
better
student
engagement
and
a
higher
level
of
interest
in
future
career
preparation
for
these
reasons
i
think
that
classes
in
the
arts
should
be
mandatory
and
offered
as
an
elective
in
order
to
provide
students
with
the
complete
learning
experience
my
interest
in
the
medical
field
began
at
an
early
age
growing
up
i
was
exposed
to
a
number
of
medical
professionals
in
my
community
who
inspired
me
to
pursue
medicine
as
a
career
i
cherish
the
knowledge
i
have
learned
and
am
driven
to
pass
it
onto
the
next
generation
i
believe
that
partnering
with
the
next
generation
to
foster
knowledge
sharing
and
collaboration
would
be
useful
for
both
sides
it
would
help
me
to
learn
more
about
the
ever evolving
medical
field
and
new
technologies
while
at
the
same
time
invest
in
the
future
of
healthcare
by
educating
the
next
generation
by
providing
mentorship
i
hope
to
not
only
facilitate
the
learning
of
the
new
generation
of
medical
professionals
but
also
inspire
others
to
pursue
their
dreams
and
ambitions
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
is
an
idea
that
should
be
seriously
considered
by
the
school
board
our
students
would
benefit
greatly
from
this
additional
learning
opportunity
of
all
having
one
and
a
half
more
hours
of
school
each
day
would
give
students
more
time
to
learn
with
more
time
students
can
cover
more
material
enabling
them
to
become
more
knowledgeable
in
a
greater
variety
of
topics
this
will
ensure
that
they
have
a
greater
understanding
of
the
material
and
are
better
equipped
to
become
successful
and
informed
citizens
similarly
having
longer
school
days
could
allow
students
to
use
their
time
more
wisely
by
having
more
time
each
day
that
is
dedicated
to
learning
students
will
be
more
likely
to
develop
good
study
habits
this
will
help
them
to
better
manage
their
time
and
prioritize
their
tasks
allowing
them
to
become
more
efficient
and
productive
additionally
the
extra
time
could
be
used
to
improve
their
understanding
skills
having
more
time
in
the
day
to
go
over
material
will
give
students
the
opportunity
to
become
more
familiar
with
the
material
they
are
learning
and
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
it
this
can
help
to
increase
their
test
scores
and
develop
their
critical
thinking
skills
making
them
even
better
learners
therefore
increasing
the
school
day
to
one
and
a
half
hours
such
as
the
school
board
is
considering
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
our
students
with
increased
time
dedicated
to
learning
our
students
will
be
able
to
learn
more
material
use
their
time
more
effectively
and
improve
their
understanding
skills

to
greater
academic

the
adoption
of
a
curfew
law
by
a
city
council
could
have
both
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
one
hand
the
law
could
provide
an
effective
way
of
promoting
the
safety
of
teenagers
by
restricting
their
freedom
to
roam
the
streets
at
late
hours
on
the
other
hand
however
the
law
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
teenagers
who
need
to
stay
out
late
due
to
work
or
lack
of
sufficient
transportation
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
role
of
parents
in
ensuring
the
safety
of
their
children
moreover
a
curfew
law
could
have
potential
legal
and
social
implications
for
example
enforcing
the
law
could
be
a
challenge
and
lead
to
punishment
for
activities
that
may
not
be
inherently
dangerous
it
is
clear
then
that
a
curfew
law
should
not
be
adopted
without
careful
research
and
consideration
of
all
the
potential
impacts

most
of
vacation
time
speak
to
your
local
museums
and
parks
about
what
programs
and
activities
are
available
and
plan
a
visit
today
when
discussing
the
potential
for
the
school
board
to
add
one
and
a
half
hour
to
school
each
day
there
are
several
aspects
to
consider
in
order
to
determine
if
this
is
a
good
decision
firstly
time
spent
in
classes
would
be
extended
which
may
affect
the
quality
of
student
interactions
with
the
material
in
the
allotted
period
also
longer
school
days
may
mean
longer
days
for
tests
and
standardized
tests
such
as
which
could
lead
to
exhaustion
and
an
inability
to
perform
to
the
best
of
one
s
ability
additionally
shorter
recess
periods
could
lead
to
an
unsatisfactory
amount
of
time
for
physical
activity
and
communication
with
peers
despite
the
potential
downsides
longer
school
days
could
be
beneficial
in
the
long term
with
more
time
spent
in
a
learning
environment
students
could
hone
their
skills
and
have
better
access
to
resources
which
may
help
them
in
achieving
their
dream
in
the
future
this
in
turn
could
help
to
develop
their
overall
understanding
of
their
subsequent
academic
path
allowing
them
to
be
better
prepared
when
the
time
comes
ultimately
whether
or
not
the
school
board
should
add
one
and
a
half
hour
to
school
each
day
is
up
for
debate
it
is
essential
to
consider
the
short term
and
long term
impacts
of
this
decision
on
students
such
as
length
of
class
time
standardized
testing
recess
and
the
future
success
of
students
immagination
is
a
powerful
tool
yet
often
it
is
overlooked
in
favour
of
knowledge
to
put
it
succinctly
once
said
that
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
this
thought
has
proven
to
be
true
in
my
life
experiences
imagination
has
provided
me
with
endless
opportunities
to
explore
and
expand
my
creativity
in
ways
that
sheer
knowledge
could
not
for
example
instead
of
falling
back
on
memorization
and
rote
learning
when
studying
for
a
test
i
found
it
was
more
beneficial
to
use
my
imagination
researching
facts
and
understanding
concepts
was
far
easier
once
i
was
able
to
think
critically
and
use
my
own
ideas
to
solve
problems
this
technique
i
used
encouraged
me
to
think
outside
the
box
and
stray
away
from
pre existing
notions
of
right
and
wrong
moreover
my
imagination
has
been
a
great
source
of
inspiration
for
my
hobby
of
writing
i
use
various
techniques
to
tap
into
my
imagination
and
let
it
flow
freely
so
that
i
can
create
stories
of
my
own
design
i
am
constantly
learning
from
my
imagination
and
using
its
resources
to
explore
the
endless
possibilities
of
life
in
many
ways
my
imagination
has
become
an
integral
part
of
my
intellectual
and
creative
development
for
this
reason
i
believe
that
s
famous
saying
that
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
is
an
accurate
statement
imagination
has
the
capacity
to
push
boundaries
and
open
the
door
to
new
realms
of
knowledge
and
understanding
when
coupled
with
knowledge
the
potential
for
personal
growth
becomes
limitless
working
with
a
group
can
be
a
great
benefit
because
it
allows
you
to
work
with
a
diverse
range
of
skills
and
opinions
when
working
with
others
you
can
discuss
ideas
and
share
the
workload
you
can
also
get
more
done
in
less
time
as
the
work
can
be
divided
and
delegated
on
the
other
hand
when
working
alone
you
get
complete
control
over
the
entire
project
which
can
be
beneficial
in
terms
of
planning
focus
and
personal
goals
you
don
t
have
to
rely
on
anyone
else
so
you
don
t
need
to
worry
about
any
potential
disagreements
that
might
arise
in
the
end
it
can
be
beneficial
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
option
and
decide
which
method
is
best
suited
for
the
task
at
hand
the
potential
benefits
of
an
after
school
homework
club
at
my
school
are
numerous
firstly
it
could
provide
students
with
a
structured
time
and
place
to
work
on
their
assignments
where
a
teacher
or
teaching
assistant
is
available
to
provide
guidance
and
educational
support
this
can
be
especially
beneficial
for
students
who
struggle
to
focus
when
completing
homework
at
home
because
of
distractions
or
lack
of
motivation
homework
clubs
can
provide
an
atmosphere
that
promotes
collaboration
where
students
can
work
together
to
solve
problems
or
complete
assignments
however
implementing
an
after
school
homework
club
can
present
certain
challenges
to
the
school
and
students
for
example
these
programs
can
require
extra
staff
resources
which
may
be
unavailable
due
to
budget
restrictions
additionally
homework
clubs
can
take
away
from
time
outside
of
school
where
students
can
engage
in
extracurricular
activities
which
can
be
important
for
social
and
personal
development
overall
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
an
after
school
homework
club
must
be
carefully
weighed
in
order
to
determine
whether
such
a
program
is
suitable
for
the
school
environment
of
whether
a
homework
club
is
implemented
it
is
important
that
students
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
grow
and
develop
their
skills
at
home
nowadays
students
are
increasingly
looking
for
alternatives
to
the
traditional
high
school
experience
one
of
these
alternatives
is
graduating
in
three
years
instead
of
the
standard
four
there
are
numerous
programs
available
that
facilitate
this
allowing
students
to
complete
their
high
school
curriculums
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
when
making
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
take
this
path
there
are
many
factors
to
consider
one
of
the
clear
benefits
of
graduating
high
school
early
is
that
it
can
provide
additional
job
opportunities
upon
completion
of
a
three year
program
students
may
have
the
opportunity
to
work
attend
college
or
volunteer
graduate
students
can
also
enter
college
at
an
earlier
stage
compared
to
others
possibly
allowing
them
to
enter
graduate
school
faster
than
their
peers
and
to
start
their
career
sooner
that
being
said
the
decision
to
leave
high
school
early
could
also
have
an
impact
on
personal
lives
such
as
having
to
move
to
a
new
area
leaving
behind
friends
and
family
besides
the
possible
advantages
it
is
important
to
consider
the
financial
implications
of
graduating
in
three
years
this
could
include
having
to
independently
pay
for
other
living
expenses
which
may
not
be
accessible
to
all
students
additionally
students
may
have
to
start
paying
bills
and
rent
which
can
be
expensive
in
conclusion
it
is
important
for
school
districts
to
carefully
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
allowing
students
to
graduate
early
for
many
the
advantages
can
outweigh
the
potential
drawbacks
and
provide
a
wide
range
of
future
possibilities
on
the
other
hand
there
may
be
some
situations
in
which
taking
this
path
may
not
be
the
most
suitable
choice
therefore
each
case
must
be
assessed
thoroughly
before
deciding
whether
or
not
this
is
the
right
move
being
honest
is
one
of
the
most
important
traits
anyone
can
possess
it
is
particularly
important
to
be
honest
with
true
friends
family
and
most
of
all
with
oneself
leads
to
trust
understanding
and
compassion
when
we
are
honest
with
those
we
care
about
we
show
them
that
we
value
our
relationships
with
them
and
that
we
are
comfortable
being
ourselves
around
them
we
also
demonstrate
that
we
can
be
trusted
to
tell
the
truth
is
also
essential
to
our
own
development
it
is
very
easy
to
get
wrapped
up
in
falsehoods
either
by
intentionally
lying
or
by
omitting
certain
facts
about
ourselves
being
honest
with
oneself
prevents
us
from
getting
lost
in
our
own
lies
only
by
facing
the
truth
no
matter
how
difficult
can
we
move
forward
and
grow
from
our
experiences
lastly
honesty
truly
is
the
best
policy
in
terms
of
our
overall
happiness
we
should
never
feel
like
we
have
to
lie
or
hide
things
in
order
to
please
others
being
straightforward
and
truthful
leads
to
peace
of
mind
and
establishes
strong
foundations
for
any
relationships
we
have
in
conclusion
being
honest
with
our
true
friends
family
and
ourselves
is
an
important
part
of
life
it
lays
the
groundwork
for
trust
understanding
and
growth
as
well
contributing
to
our
own
peace
of
mind
being
honest
with
those
we
love
and
with
ourselves

ultimately
lead
to
a
more
fulfilling
life

negative
aspects
of
technology
when
incorporating
it
into
our

the
necessary
job
skills

that
nothing
is
at

this
is
a
statement
about
personal
authenticity
that
reflects

assistance
finally
making
time
to
take
advantage
of
educational
and
self development
opportunities
can
help
create
a
more
rewarding
future
the
debate
surrounding
the
concept
of
intentional
inactivity
serving
a
purpose
and
how
it
can
be
beneficial
is
prevalent
after
deep
research
and
examination
of
historical
evidence
there
appears
to
be
a
consensus
that
in
order
to
achieve
something
a
certain
amount
of
work
is
necessary
however
a
delicate
work life
balance
can
be
beneficial
for
those
striving
for
more
despite
being
in
difficult
situations
dedicating
time
and
energy
into
working
on
something
no
matter
how
small
can
provide
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
accomplishment
as
a
result
managing
tasks
efficiently
alongside
time
for
rest
and
relaxation
can
result
in
increased
productivity
and
an
overall
higher
quality
of
life
as
the
debate
over
school
schedules
continues
to
be
an
ongoing
issue
an
innovative
idea
has
been
proposed
reduce
the
number
of
school
days
from
five
to
four
and
increase
the
length
of
each
day
to
two
extra
hours
while
this
idea
has
drawn
both
support
and
criticism
there
are
many
valid
arguments
in
favor
of
the
four day
school
week
with
two
extra
hours
of
school
each
day
a
four day
school
week
would
reduce
stress
by
allowing
students
teachers
and
staff
more
time
to
socialize
participate
in
extra curricular
activities
or
pursue
hobbies
the
extra
two
hours
per
day
would
also
allow
teachers
to
dig
deeper
into
their
subjects
and
help
students
stay
engaged
and
focused
furthermore
a
four day
school
week
would
provide
an
economic
benefit
as
schools
would
need
fewer
personnel
to
clean
and
maintain
the
buildings
plus
this
would
give
families
a
bit
of
a
break
when
it
comes
to
childcare
responsibilities
as
they
could
use
those
days
to
plan
activities
run
errands
or
simply
get
some
much needed
rest
ultimately
a
four day
school
week
with
two
extra
hours
of
school
each
day
would
be
beneficial
for
everyone
involved
students
would
have
fewer
days
to
feel
anxious
and
overwhelmed
while
still
having
the
opportunity
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
subjects
they
are
studying
additionally
the
cost
savings
for
schools
would
be
a
welcome
bonus
in
short
moving
to
a
four day
school
week
with
two
extra
hours
of
school
each
day
represents
an
innovative
way
of
ensuring
students
receive
a
quality
education
while
reducing
stress
and
providing
a
cost effective
solution
for
schools
motivation
can
play
a
key
role
in
many
aspects
of
life
in
sports
for
example
motivation
is
integral
to
striving
for
the
best
performance
whether
it
s
trying
to
beat
a
personal
record
or
striving
for
a
championship
title
motivation
can
lead
to
personal
successes
and
team
victories
similarly
in
professional
settings
staying
motivated
can
be
a
deciding
factor
in
career
success
whether
it
s
pushing
your
limits
to
move
ahead
in
an
organization
or
staying
motivated
to
complete
a
project
maintaining
dedication
and
enthusiasm
can
be
key
to
making
progress
finally
motivation
is
essential
for
achieving
life
goals
whether
it
s
reaching
a
dream
job
or
saving
for
a
purchase
using
motivation
to
move
consistently
towards
a
goal
can
be
key
to
lasting
success
in
all
these
instances
motivation
is
a
recurring
factor
that
has
the
potential
to
make
or
break
lifelong
endeavors
is
a
major
presence
in
our
lives
as
it
affects
every
aspect
of
how
we
interact
with
the
world
how
we
interact
with
ourselves
and
how
we
view
ourselves
the
question
of
how
we
choose
and
shape
our
characters
often
comes
up
whether
it
is
through
shaping
our
own
character
traits
or
through
the
influences
of
others
on
one
hand
it
could
be
argued
that
character
traits
are
primarily
shaped
by
our
experiences
and
environment
from
the
moment
we
are
born
and
begin
to
interact
with
the
world
we
are
constantly
presented
with
new
opportunities
to
shape
our
character
that
are
dependent
on
the
individuals
and
influences
we
come
into
contact
with
in
this
way
it
could
be
said
that
character
is
built
up
through
external
factors
that
contain
a
certain
amount
of
influence
on
our
development
on
the
other
hand
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
critical
role
that
we
play
in
the
process
of
forming
our
character
our
decisions
our
actions
and
our
goals
all
serve
to
shape
our
character
from
making
choices
that
align
with
our
values
to
deliberately
seeking
out
new
experiences
and
perspectives
our
ability
to
choose
our
character
traits
is
a
powerful
part
of
the
journey
to
achieving
our
true
selves
whether
we
are
aware
of
it
or
not
our
choices
in
life
reflect
aspects
of
our
characters
and
serve
to
shape
our
behavior
in
many
ways
ultimately
it
is
clear
that
character
building
is
a
complex
interplay
between
the
influences
that
come
from
our
environment
our
experiences
and
our
own
decisions
at
the
end
of
the
day
our
character
is
ultimately
our
responsibility
and
it
is
within
our
power
to
shape
it
we
must
take
the
necessary
steps
to
build
up
the
traits
that
we
need
in
order
to
thrive
in
life
extended
school
hours
would
be
likely
to
have
a
negative
effect
on
students
and
their
educational
experiences
here
are
three
reasons
why
the
school
board
should
not
extend
the
daily
school
hours
by
one
and
a
half
hours
increased
school
hours
would
wear
out
students
leading
to
a
decrease
in
overall
student
engagement
during
class
many
students
already
feel
overwhelmed
managing
multiple
classes
and
activities
and
the
strain
of
adding
additional
hours
of
class
and
homework
would
be
too
great
second
increased
school
hours
could
cause
students
to
skip
out
on
extracurriculars
which
provide
valuable
skills
for
future
success
as
students
already
struggle
to
find
the
balance
between
their
school
work
and
extracurriculars
additional
hours
would
only
add
to
the
stress
and
could
result
in
students
forgoing
many
activities
outside
of
class
thus
limiting
their
opportunities
for
growth
an
extended
school
day
would
lessen
students
free
time
this
would
especially
affect
those
with
commitments
outside
of
school
such
as
jobs
and
family
obligations
which
are
essential
and
enriching
experiences
for
adolescents
limiting
their
free
hours
could
result
in
social
emotional
and
financial
detriment
in
conclusion
the
school
board
should
not
extend
the
daily
school
hours
by
one
and
a
half
hours
as
this
would
be
likely
to
have
negative
implications
for
students
it
is
true
that
s
statement
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
is
an
essential
lesson
to
live
by
the
concept
can
be
supported
by
a
variety
of
examples
both
within
and
beyond
our
own
lives
at
a
macro
level
take
education
as
an
example
if
students
only
aspire
to
achieve
mediocre
grades
they
will
ultimately
satisfy
themselves
with
mediocrity
this
leaves
them
stuck
in
a
perpetual
cycle
of
complacency
knowing
that
they
may
not
be
challenged
to
learn
or
grow
it
is
far
better
to
have
the
courage
to
aim
for
excellence
even
if
it
means
taking
risks
falling
short
and
learning
from
those
mistakes
if
we
can
adopt
an
attitude
of
resilience
in
times
of
adversity
we
will
open
new
doors
and
opportunities
that
were
not
available
to
us
before
on
a
smaller
scale
let
s
consider
a
job
search
someone
settles
for
a
position
that
only
meets
their
minimal
expectations
despite
feeling
satisfied
with
their
easy
progress
this
individual
may
not
have
the
resources
and
opportunities
to
advance
further
and
achieve
long term
success
on
the
other
hand
if
someone
has
a
higher
vision
and
the
courage
to
seek
something
better
they
can
look
for
more
challenging
positions
that
they
may
have
thought
impossible
before
not
only
are
they
likely
to
find
satisfaction
as
they
develop
invaluable
skills
but
may
also
be
rewarded
with
promotions
that
come
with
additional
benefits
s
statement
is
a
valuable
reminder
that
any
achievement
will
ultimately
be
worth
more
if
we
have
the
courage
to
aim
higher
and
push
ourselves
beyond
our
limits
we
can
not
expect
to
make
meaningful
progress
if
we
are
constantly
settling
for
less
than
we
are
capable
of
it
is
essential
to
have
dreams
embrace
challenges
and
risk
failure
in
order
to
be
able
to
truly
celebrate
our
success
working
in
a
group
has
many
tangible
benefits
we
can
share
ideas
and
create
solutions
that
are
more
creative
than
what
one
person
could
come
up
with
alone
by
combining
different
perspectives
and
information
a
group
can
form
a
more
complete
understanding
than
any
one
individual
could
furthermore
if
a
member
of
the
group
gets
sick
on
vacation
or
is
otherwise
unable
to
continue
work
the
other
members
can
seamlessly
continue
due
to
the
collective
knowledge
of
the
group
most
importantly
working
in
a
group
allows
for
more
support
and
understandings
of
concepts
we
can
talk
about
our
problems
and
come
up
with
solutions
more
quickly
when
we
are
working
together
in
conclusion
working
in
a
group
is
a
great
way
to
break
down
complex
problems
into
manageable
parts
create
solutions
more
quickly
and
find
solutions
that
may
be
better
than
what
any
one
person
could
come
up
with
alone
the
ability
for
examples
actions
reasons
and
personal
advice
to
positively
influence
others
is
vast
and
multifaceted
in
many
cases
one
of
these
methods
can
be
excellent
for
encouraging
or
motivating
another
person
for
example
providing
a
relevant
or
relatable
example
can
help
someone
to
envision
a
goal
or
understand
an
idea
more
deeply
actions
such
as
leading
by
example
can
also
be
beneficial
in
reinforcing
the
idea
that
positive
behavior
can
be
rewarding
providing
reasons
for
why
a
course
of
action
should
be
taken
or
why
a
certain
result
is
desired
can
help
create
understanding
and
spark
interest
in
the
subject
in
question
providing
personalized
advice
tailored
to
the
individual
can
help
show
that
their
opinions
and
voice
matter
and
can
help
to
hone
in
on
the
best
course
of
action
ultimately
using
examples
actions
reasons
and
personal
advice
to
influence
others
positively
can
be
extremely
beneficial
as
evidenced
by
countless
successful
relationships
and
teams
is
well
known
for
his
musing
that
a
foolish
consistency
is
the
hobgoblin
of
little
minds
to
him
it
meant
that
life
should
be
an
ever evolving
journey
of
discovery
rather
than
settling
for
what
one
already
knows
many
people
take
this
statement
as
an
invitation
to
push
past
their
comfort
zone
and
take
a
step
into
the
unknown
although
this
message
may
be
motivating
there
are
a
few
who
disagree
with
s
viewpoint
it
can
be
argued
that
people
can
still
grow
and
develop
without
trying
something
new
taking
time
to
reflect
on
the
lessons
already
learned
can
lead
to
personal
growth
that
foundations
have
been
laid
for
a
person
can
also
develop
new
skills
within
an
already
familiar
subject
such
as
furthering
the
understanding
of
mathematics
despite
this
attempting
something
beyond
what
one
has
already
mastered
can
be
incredibly
rewarding
by
pushing
beyond
preconceived
boundaries
people
can
open
themselves
up
to
fresh
creative
ideas
and
make
incredible
breakthroughs
in
addition
to
this
people
may
develop
transferable
skills
that
can
be
applied
to
a
variety
of
contexts
finally
mastering
something
new
may
give
a
person
the
inspiration
and
confidence
to
attempt
further
feats
s
idea
of
venturing
beyond
one
s
comfort
zone
holds
considerable
merit
pushing
boundaries
and
attempting
something
new
can
often
lead
to
phenomenal
results
both
personally
and
professionally
success
without
failure
is
a
concept
that
many
people
believe
is
impossible
after
all
failure
is
an
inherent
part
of
life
and
it
shapes
how
we
approach
success
but
is
it
possible
to
succeed
without
ever
failing
the
answer
is
yes
it
is
possible
to
succeed
without
failure
people
can
use
their
skills
talents
and
wisdom
to
conquer
any
obstacle
that
comes
their
way
doesn
t
necessarily
require
a
person
to
have
experienced
failure
along
the
way
there
are
individuals
who
have
achieved
great
things
without
ever
experiencing
any
kind
of
failure
take
sportspeople
for
example
some
athletes
succeed
without
ever
running
into
any
obstacles
or
facing
any
failures
for
example
never
gave
up
despite
falling
out
of
the
top
ten
rankings
in
his
resilience
and
focus
got
him
back
to
the
winner
s
podium
in
despite
multiple
back
operations
in
between
so
it
is
indeed
possible
to
succeed
without
failure
the
key
is
to
learn
from
mistakes
manage
expectations
and
apply
all
knowledge
and
skills
to
get
to
the
top
it
may
take
a
bit
longer
but
it
is
not
impossible
as
once
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
attending
classes
online
has
both
pros
and
cons
for
instance
students
may
benefit
from
the
flexibility
of
learning
from
any
location
and
the
availability
of
courses
that
may
not
be
available
in
their
local
area
additionally
they
have
access
to
a
larger
range
of
resources
from
all
over
the
world
on
the
other
hand
individuals
must
be
self motivated
and
dedicated
to
study
without
the
physical
presence
of
an
instructor
and
the
direct
feedback
from
peers
furthermore
students
may
be
isolated
from
the
interactive
learning
experience
of
a
traditional
classroom
and
become
overwhelmed
with
the
vast
amount
of
study
material
available
online
it
is
recommendable
for
students
to
establish
strategies
to
help
them
succeed
in
their
online
courses
for
example
creating
a
studying
schedule
forming
online
study
groups
and
creating
a
supportive
learning
environment
could
help
them
overcome
the
difficulties
associated
with
the
online
learning
experience
are
an
essential
part
of
the
language
and
play
a
key
role
in
our
writing
using
the
right
verb
can
add
clarity
and
accuracy
to
a
sentence
and
help
ensure
that
the
intended
meaning
is
accurately
conveyed
however
using
the
wrong
verb
can
cause
confusion
and
misinterpretation
which
can
lead
to
miscommunication
for
example
if
a
sentence
states
that
someone
ran
quickly
instead
of
sprinted
quickly
the
reader
may
assume
the
subject
was
running
at
a
leisurely
pace
this
example
highlights
why
it
is
important
to
use
the
correct
verb
in
writing
which
can
be
done
by
being
thoughtful
with
one
s
word
choice
and
referencing
a
dictionary
if
a
certain
verb
is
not
certain
on
the
other
hand
if
the
wrong
verb
is
used
on
purpose
or
with
the
intention
to
deceive
the
reader
then
the
consequences
of
using
the
wrong
verb
can
be
much
more
serious
additionally
if
the
wrong
verb
is
used
in
a
legal
or
professional
document
such
as
in
a
contract
or
court
filing
the
consequences
can
be
especially
dire
as
wrong
verb
usage
can
potentially
invalidate
the
document
and
lead
to
further
scrutiny
and
allegations
of
fraud
in
conclusion
it
is
critical
to
always
use
the
correct
verb
when
writing
while
simply
using
the
wrong
verb
will
not
always
lead
to
detrimental
results
it
is
important
to
understand
the
potential
consequences
of
such
errors
and
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
ensure
verb
accuracy
when
composing
any
document
it
is
important
to
understand
the
ways
in
which
you
can
influence
another
person
there
is
a
difference
between
talking
to
someone
about
your
personal
experience
versus
talking
softly
and
calmly
about
their
behaviour
when
discussing
your
experience
you
may
get
the
person
to
empathise
with
your
point
of
view
and
possibly
adjust
their
behaviour
accordingly
talking
softly
and
calmly
focuses
more
on
pushing
the
person
towards
a
goal
this
method
is
gentler
and
can
encourage
the
other
person
to
act
in
the
desired
way
of
the
approach
it
is
important
to
consider
the
consequences
of
both
methods
and
to
choose
wisely
first
impressions
can
be
highly
influential
but
they
are
not
always
indicative
of
the
reality
of
a
situation
or
person
people
often
bring
their
own
biases
and
assumptions
to
a
situation
influencing
the
way
they
perceive
a
person
or
event
initially
over
time
with
more
interaction
and
experience
people
can
learn
new
things
about
a
person
or
situation
and
their
perception
can
change
as
a
result
for
example
when
someone
meets
a
person
for
the
first
time
they
may
make
an
assumption
about
them
based
on
their
appearance
or
behavior
over
time
through
conversation
and
shared
experiences
that
initial
assessment
may
be
modified
as
they
learn
more
about
the
other
person
similarly
when
someone
first
experiences
an
unfamiliar
environment
they
may
form
an
opinion
about
the
place
as
they
take
the
time
to
explore
further
however
they
might
find
new
information
that
alters
their
initial
impression
there
is
no
doubt
that
deciding
to
commit
to
a
job
at
a
young
age
can
bring
many
advantages
perhaps
the
biggest
pro
is
the
potential
to
gain
invaluable
experience
early
on
having
an
opportunity
to
quickly
build
up
knowledge
and
skills
while
still
in
school
can
give
the
young
person
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
job
market
in
addition
a
job
can
provide
a
young
person
with
some
financial
stability
to
pay
for
college
tuition
or
other
expenses
however
there
are
also
some
potential
cons
to
consider
when
committing
to
a
job
at
a
young
age
for
example
the
rigid
schedule
of
a
full time
job
may
limit
a
young
person
s
ability
to
pursue
other
interests
or
activities
such
as
volunteering
internships
and
hobbies
furthermore
trying
to
balance
school
work
and
a
job
can
be
challenging
leading
to
a
lack
of
sleep
or
burnout
on
top
of
that
a
young
person
may
face
age related
discrimination
in
the
workplace
making
it
difficult
to
get
ahead
in
the
end
deciding
whether
or
not
to
commit
to
a
job
at
a
young
age
is
an
individual
decision
that
needs
to
be
carefully
weighed
being
aware
of
both
the
potential
pros
and
cons
can
help
young
people
make
informed
decisions
building
self esteem
by
accomplishing
goals
can
have
powerful
and
long lasting
effects
achieving
goals
can
give
us
a
sense
of
accomplishment
a
powerful
boost
to
our
confidence
and
a
feeling
of
increased
pride
in
ourselves
for
instance
if
an
individual
sets
a
goal
to
finish
a
book
and
perseveres
to
the
end
of
the
project
they
can
feel
a
sense
of
accomplishment
from
having
completed
the
task
similarly
if
a
person
pursues
a
goal
to
become
healthier
and
meets
that
goal
they
can
be
filled
with
an
inner
sense
of
pride
self satisfaction
and
enhanced
self worth
these
feelings
of
increased
self esteem
from
goal
achievement
are
different
from
the
sense
of
self worth
that
comes
from
praise
while
praise
from
others
can
be
encouraging
and
uplifting
it
is
more
fleeting
and
does
not
necessarily
fuel
an
inner
motivation
to
work
harder
or
strive
for
your
goals
however
self esteem
from
achieving
goals
leaves
a
lasting
impression
that
can
be
accessed
even
when
no
outside
praise
is
available
graduating
from
high
school
early
can
be
a
tempting
option
for
students
as
it
promises
rewards
such
as
a
head
start
on
college
more
job
prospects
and
reduced
costs
however
there
are
also
drawbacks
to
consider
such
as
limited
electives
reduced
relaxation
and
vacation
time
and
the
need
to
put
in
extra
effort
when
seeking
out
new
courses
of
study
it
is
important
to
research
the
pros
and
cons
of
graduating
early
thoroughly
and
understand
the
implications
of
doing
so
first
impressions
are
powerful
indications
of
how
we
perceive
and
evaluate
people
and
places
quite
establishes
a
lasting
impression
more
vividly
than
a
first
glimpse
whether
it
be
meeting
a
person
for
the
first
time
or
visiting
a
new
city
first
impressions
often
heavily
influence
the
path
of
our
opinion
for
instance
if
a
professional
interviews
for
a
job
and
wears
dirty
or
unkempt
clothes
they
may
not
make
the
best
first
impression
their
future
employer
may
remember
their
initial
appearance
and
it
can
have
an
impact
on
decisions
and
considerations
later
down
the
line
the
same
can
be
said
for
a
city
if
a
person
visits
a
place
for
the
first
time
and
is
inundated
with
a
barrage
of
bright
lights
loud
noises
and
lively
people
they
may
be
enamored
with
the
atmosphere
and
form
a
favorable
opinion
right
away
in
summary
first
impressions
can
set
a
precedent
for
opinion
and
image
it
can
be
a
deciding
factor
in
many
different
kinds
of
situations
and
heavily
shape
perception
it
is
essential
to
consider
these
judgments
when
interacting
with
people
and
places
as
the
school
year
winds
down
each
year
a
summer
break
of
three
months
beckons
reducing
the
length
of
summer
break
though
often
met
with
resistance
has
been
proposed
as
a
solution
to
some
of
the
educational
system
s
current
issues
before
deciding
whether
to
reduce
time
off
in
the
summer
it
is
important
to
evaluate
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
such
a
drastic
change
in
schedule
on
one
hand
proponents
of
shortening
summer
break
argue
that
the
extra
time
in
the
classroom
will
lead
to
better
academic
performance
as
students
will
have
more
opportunities
to
learn
and
apply
their
knowledge
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
reducing
summer
vacation
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
the
summer
learning
slump
as
students
minds
remain
sharp
and
engaged
year round
however
while
these
benefits
are
worth
considering
there
are
some
potential
inconveniences
that
can
not
be
ignored
for
one
thing
a
shorter
summer
break
would
drastically
reduce
the
amount
of
free
time
students
would
have
to
explore
rest
and
relaxation
activities
and
contribute
to
their
own
personal
growth
the
development
of
hobbies
and
use
of
creative
outlets
is
an
important
part
of
childhood
and
reducing
the
number
of
months
available
for
engaging
in
such
activities
can
be
damaging
additionally
an
extended
school
year
often
leaves
less
time
for
students
to
spend
with
friends
and
family
diminishing
important
social
interaction
needed
for
optimal
mental
and
physical
health
while
it
may
appear
that
the
pros
of
shortening
summer
vacation
could
greatly
benefit
the
educational
system
the
negatives
that
come
with
it
should
also
be
taken
into
account
taking
away
time
from
optimal
physical
and
mental
activity
and
reducing
the
ability
for
students
to
develop
outside
the
classroom
can
be
detrimental
in
the
long
term
therefore
reducing
the
length
of
summer
break
should
not
be
considered
at
this
time
as
the
principal
of
our
school
i
m
sure
you
want
to
give
students
the
best
opportunities
to
build
a
positive
environment
both
physically
and
mentally
while
we
have
many
sports
teams
at
our
school
available
to
students
a
policy
change
is
urgently
needed
to
make
sure
that
everyone
has
a
chance
to
join
the
criteria
for
joining
teams
is
restricted
to
highly
experienced
students
who
often
have
had
the
chance
to
receive
extra
and
expensive
after school
training
to
become
proficient
in
the
sport
this
puts
many
students
at
a
disadvantage
as
they
can
not
participate
on
the
team
if
they
can
not
meet
the
physical
and
technical
requirements
updating
the
policy
to
allow
students
a
chance
to
join
no
matter
what
their
skill
level
is
would
open
up
a
larger
range
of
students
to
join
teams
moreover
providing
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
develop
skills
in
the
sport
for
those
with
less
experience
would
ensure
that
everyone
has
a
chance
to
be
part
of
the
team
a
change
in
policy
would
also
support
the
inclusion
of
students
from
backgrounds
who
may
have
never
considered
participating
in
sports
increasing
opportunities
for
students
in
this
way
can
contribute
to
an
overall
more
positive
school
climate
where
everyone
can
feel
included
additionally
students
who
join
teams
often
have
improved
mental
health
better
relationships
with
peers
and
increased
motivation
in
academic
studies
with
so
many
potential
benefits
for
the
whole
school
i
respectfully
request
that
policy
changes
be
made
to
provide
students
the
chance
to
join
sports
teams
regardless
of
their
experience
level
i
strongly
believe
this
would
be
beneficial
to
our
students
and
our
school
in
recent
years
the
idea
of
implementing
a
three
year
high
school
program
instead
of
a
four
year
program
has
been
raised
however
this
is
not
the
best
option
for
students
and
school
districts
most
colleges
prefer
students
that
have
completed
four
years
of
high
school
thus
many
of
the
graduates
in
a
three
year
program
may
not
be
adequately
prepared
to
enroll
in
a
higher
education
institution
additionally
since
there
are
fewer
years
to
complete
all
necessary
courses
and
credits
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
students
to
accumulate
them
taking
away
from
valuable
time
that
could
have
been
used
to
learn
more
in depth
and
increase
students
abilities
in
any
given
topic
a
vital
component
of
the
high
school
experience
is
having
access
to
teachers
school
counselors
and
school
librarians
who
are
available
to
help
students
succeed
reducing
the
high
school
program
by
one
year
would
drastically
reduce
the
amount
of
time
students
would
have
access
to
these
resources
additionally
it
would
send
the
wrong
message
to
younger
students
who
are
anticipating
beginning
their
high
school
experience
that
graduating
in
three
years
is
the
best
option
even
though
it
may
not
be
overall
it
is
important
to
consider
all
of
the
implications
of
implementing
a
three
year
high
school
program
before
moving
forward
the
four
year
high
school
program
offers
many
more
advantages
for
both
the
students
and
the
school
district
leading
to
a
more
successful
academic
future
i
recently
had
the
chance
to
get
to
know
someone
on
a
deeper
level
we
talked
about
our
hobbies
favorite
places
to
visit
and
our
dream
vacation
it
was
great
to
learn
about
their
interests
and
how
i
could
help
them
if
they
ever
need
it
so
i
suggested
we
should
catch
up
soon
and
we
could
choose
to
chat
via
text
go
shopping
or
even
watch
some
movies
i
also
thought
about
activities
that
could
bring
us
closer
together
such
as
team
activities
this
way
we
could
form
a
strong
bond
and
have
a
good
start
to
our
friendship
most
of
all
i
wanted
to
make
sure
the
other
person
felt
comfortable
accepted
and
cared
for
setting
high
aims
is
essential
in
order
to
achieve
our
goals
it
pushes
us
to
work
harder
while
giving
us
the
motivation
to
strive
for
more
when
we
aim
high
there
is
a
greater
potential
for
success
because
it
allows
us
to
dream
bigger
and
reach
higher
however
there
is
a
risk
of
failure
when
we
set
our
aims
too
high
either
due
to
an
unrealistic
timeline
or
a
task
that
is
too
complex
therefore
it
is
important
to
carefully
consider
the
level
of
difficulty
that
exists
in
any
goal
setting
process
on
the
other
hand
if
we
set
our
aims
too
low
we
can
become
complacent
or
lose
motivation
to
continue
striving
for
something
more
we
can
also
fail
to
recognize
or
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
that
exists
in
front
of
us
therefore
it
is
important
to
challenge
ourselves
and
find
a
healthy
balance
between
aiming
too
high
and
too
low
in
conclusion
humans
need
to
set
their
aims
too
high
in
order
to
achieve
their
goals
doing
so
can
cause
both
risks
and
rewards
depending
on
how
difficult
the
goal
is
consequently
it
is
better
to
find
a
balance
between
aiming
too
high
and
low
in
order
to
maximize
success
seeking
guidance
from
trained
professionals
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
stress
levels
help
you
learn
new
skills
even
treat
depression
in
addition
seeking
guidance
can
save
time
and
make
life
easier
for
instance
a
mental
health
professional
can
provide
guidance
and
direct
conversations
that
can
help
reduce
stress
a
career
counselor
can
provide
resources
that
can
help
a
person
learn
relevant
skills
and
provide
guidance
on
how
to
make
life
easier
finally
a
therapist
or
counselor
can
provide
guidance
and
resources
that
may
be
beneficial
in
treating
depression
praising
students
for
their
work
is
an
important
part
of
creating
a
positive
and
encouraging
educational
environment
studies
have
shown
that
providing
students
with
feedback
and
recognition
has
a
positive
impact
on
their
academic
performance
engagement
and
general
motivation
research
indicates
that
students
who
receive
praise
are
more
likely
to
develop
more
resilient
and
self reliant
attitudes
this
helps
them
develop
a
more
effective
way
of
tackling
problems
building
confidence
in
their
academic
skills
and
capabilities
it
is
crucial
for
both
teachers
and
parents
to
provide
meaningful
and
appropriate
praise
to
their
students
and
children
when
praising
students
teachers
and
parents
should
focus
on
their
effort
accomplishments
and
the
value
of
their
work
instead
of
their
raw
performance
or
results
this
will
help
students
recognize
their
strengths
and
abilities
as
well
as
become
more
motivated
to
set
and
achieve
goals
regular
praise
that
is
genuine
and
supportive
also
helps
to
boost
students
self esteem
and
reduce
their
fear
of
failure
praise
is
an
effective
tool
for
educators
and
guardians
and
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
it
is
given
appropriately
and
frequently
doing
so
ensures
that
students
are
provided
with
clear
and
positive
reinforcement
to
help
them
succeed
in
their
educational
journey
after
months
of
research
i
had
familiarized
myself
with
the
principles
and
practices
of
assets
i
was
excited
to
have
the
opportunity
to
join
the
of
in
order
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
assets
and
the
mechanics
of
the
business
industry
taking
part
in
and
was
the
perfect
way
to
build
my
knowledge
and
hone
my
skills
to
be
considered
for
the
exclusive
fieldtrip
to
assets
i
was
ready
to
take
my
skills
to
the
next
level
and
apply
for
the
trip
had
always
taken
his
studies
seriously
working
hard
in
middle
school
he
was
proud
to
find
out
that
he
got
good
grades
and
had
passed
all
the
tests
after
repeating
that
success
in
high
school
he
was
ready
to
explore
opportunities
for
continuing
his
education
in
college
looking
into
scholarships
he
was
thrilled
to
hear
back
from
a
university
that
he
d
been
accepted
and
could
join
them
if
he
received
the
scholarship
he
chose
to
accept
and
with
the
support
of
his
family
and
friends
worked
hard
to
ensure
that
he
would
have
a
successful
graduation
celebration
to
mark
the
end
of
his
studies
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
is
essential
for
achieving
a
successful
and
fulfilling
lifestyle
by
embracing
a
positive
outlook
we
can
better
create
relationships
with
those
around
us
allowing
us
to
form
strong
and
meaningful
connections
to
those
we
interact
with
positive
thinking
can
also
help
us
stay
motivated
and
feel
motivated
to
work
towards
our
goals
we
can
confidently
believe
in
our
ability
to
achieve
our
goals
utilizing
our
positive
attitude
as
an
important
tool
to
realize
our
ambitions
in
addition
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
a
very
valuable
asset
in
the
working
environment
it
can
help
us
to
better
cope
with
stress
and
workplace
pressures
as
well
as
to
cultivate
better
relations
with
colleagues
having
a
positive
attitude
can
also
make
us
more
approachable
to
others
and
can
help
us
to
stand
out
to
employers
employees
with
a
good
attitude
can
inspire
others
around
them
and
are
often
looked
upon
more
favorably
by
employers
due
to
the
positive
attitude
that
they
possess
ultimately
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
leading
a
successful
and
fulfilling
life
taking
steps
to
cultivate
the
right
mindset
can
help
us
to
create
meaningful
connections
with
others
stay
motivated
to
pursue
our
goals
and
become
more
productive
in
our
job
and
career
first
impressions
are
incredibly
significant
in
our
relationships
with
others
in
my
experience
our
initial
impressions
can
go
a
long
way
in
dictating
how
we
interact
and
interact
with
people
in
the
future
for
example
when
i
was
introduced
to
a
colleague
at
an
event
she
made
a
wonderful
first
impression
by
being
friendly
engaging
in
small
talk
and
offering
me
some
helpful
advice
as
a
result
i
found
myself
more
comfortable
talking
to
her
in
the
future
and
was
willing
to
reach
out
for
advice
on
various
projects
on
the
other
hand
a
negative
first
impression
can
be
difficult
to
overcome
and
can
influence
our
perception
of
someone
for
a
long
time
the
stories
we
tell
ourselves
about
people
based
on
first
impressions
can
be
hard
to
change
leading
us
to
distancing
ourselves
from
those
we
deemed
unfavorable
at
first
thus
it
is
clear
that
making
a
positive
first
impression
can
be
incredibly
important
in
developing
and
maintaining
relationships
with
others
i
believe
that
being
conscious
of
our
first
interactions
and
taking
the
time
to
make
a
good
impression
can
go
a
long
way
in
cultivating
strong
relationships
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
on
an
assigned
task
can
be
a
tricky
decision
there
are
distinct
pros
and
cons
to
consider
when
deciding
which
method
to
use
one
of
the
major
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
is
the
synergy
that
can
be
created
each
group
member
brings
their
own
unique
set
of
skills
to
the
table
and
can
help
build
upon
one
another
s
ideas
as
a
result
the
group
is
able
to
create
a
better
solution
to
the
problem
than
what
could
have
been
produced
by
a
single
person
working
alone
can
also
have
its
advantages
for
instance
it
can
be
easier
to
concentrate
on
the
task
at
hand
without
the
distractions
and
noise
that
can
occur
in
large
groups
personal
creativity
can
also
be
better
realized
when
you
are
working
on
a
task
by
yourself
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
can
sometimes
be
isolating
and
can
lead
to
the
task
taking
longer
than
it
would
take
with
a
group
in
a
group
different
individuals
can
work
in
tandem
and
fill
in
for
when
others
get
stuck
working
alone
can
also
lead
to
ineffective
communication
and
in
the
case
of
major
projects
it
can
be
hard
to
know
where
to
start
in
conclusion
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
both
working
with
a
group
and
working
alone
on
an
assigned
task
ultimately
the
best
approach
to
take
depends
on
the
individual
task
and
the
resources
available
it
is
important
to
postpone
judgment
until
the
different
options
have
been
properly
weighed
when
it
comes
to
achieving
personal
success
there
are
many
benefits
to
working
or
doing
tasks
individually
working
alone
allows
individuals
to
develop
important
skills
such
as
problem
solving
time
management
and
independent
decision making
being
yourself
is
also
an
important
factor
for
success
when
an
individual
works
by
themselves
they
are
better
able
to
recognize
their
latent
strengths
and
weaknesses
this
awareness
helps
them
better
plan
and
achieve
their
goals
working
or
doing
things
with
a
partner
can
also
have
its
advantages
being
part
of
a
team
can
give
individuals
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
others
establish
strong
relationships
and
create
successful
collaborative
projects
however
working
or
completing
tasks
alone
can
also
be
incredibly
rewarding
knowing
that
a
project
was
accomplished
without
help
from
others
allows
for
a
unique
feeling
of
personal
accomplishment
plus
when
an
individual
works
or
does
things
on
their
own
there
is
often
more
freedom
to
explore
different
ideas
and
to
focus
on
their
individual
strengths
in
conclusion
working
or
doing
things
individually
certainly
leads
to
personal
success
the
skills
developed
when
working
or
doing
things
on
your
own
such
as
time
management
problem
solving
and
independent
decision making
can
help
an
individual
reach
their
goals
more
quickly
and
effectively
being
yourself
is
also
essential
for
success
in
order
to
make
the
best
use
of
an
individual
s
strengths
achieving
success
on
one
s
own
can
be
incredibly
rewarding
and
empowering
and
serves
as
a
powerful
reminder
of
what
individuals
are
capable
of
accomplishing
when
they
put
their
minds
to
it
when
it
comes
to
deciding
whether
to
pursue
extracurricular
activities
students
consider
a
variety
of
factors
the
availability
of
activities
is
an
important
consideration
as
is
the
cost
associated
with
the
activity
for
students
with
tight
budgets
the
cost
can
be
a
deterrent
especially
if
the
cost
of
supplies
and
equipment
for
the
activity
is
high
additionally
students
may
also
factor
in
the
amount
of
time
involved
in
the
activity
as
many
are
already
juggling
schoolwork
with
extra curriculars
lastly
students
might
also
take
into
account
their
own
goals
whether
or
not
they
are
passionate
about
the
activity
whether
they
can
gain
practical
experience
or
develop
skills
when
choosing
which
activities
to
pursue
today
we
re
going
to
talk
about
two
very
important
operations
multiplying
and
dividing
we
use
multiplying
and
dividing
to
do
calculations
quickly
and
solve
problems
in
the
real
world
let
s
use
an
example
to
show
how
multiplying
and
dividing
is
faster
than
using
adding
and
subtracting
imagine
that
you
have
apples
and
want
to
give
them
all
to
your
friends
with
adding
and
subtracting
you
d
need
to
find
the
total
of
how
many
apples
you
have
and
then
take
that
total
and
divide
it
by
to
figure
out
how
much
each
friend
will
get
that
s
a
lot
of
work
but
with
multiplying
and
dividing
you
can
solve
the
problem
much
faster
you
can
just
divide
by
the
number
of
friends
you
have
let
s
say
three
friends
here
that
means
you
can
say
each
friend
will
get
three
apples
without
doing
any
adding
or
subtracting
so
as
you
can
see
using
multiplying
and
dividing
can
be
a
great
way
to
solve
problems
quickly
and
efficiently
so
let
s
get
to
it
and
start
learning
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
of
different
ages
to
learn
from
each
other
in
the
same
educational
environment
due
to
their
differences
in
knowledge
levels
and
diverse
experiences
programs
with
both
older
students
and
those
who
are
much
younger
can
face
challenges
as
the
educational
experience
can
be
inhibited
by
these
differences
it
is
important
to
consider
the
impact
of
this
intergenerational
mix
on
both
younger
and
older
students
for
example
an
essay
described
a
student
s
experience
in
such
a
program
in
which
the
older
students
often
contributed
to
the
lack
of
learning
for
the
younger
students
the
older
students
may
have
more
experience
and
knowledge
than
their
younger
peers
and
as
a
result
they
could
overwhelm
the
younger
students
this
student
s
experience
therefore
differed
from
other
similar
programs
where
there
was
a
more
even
mix
of
the
different
age
groups
given
the
challenge
that
programs
with
both
older
and
youngest
students
can
face
there
are
a
few
strategies
that
can
help
to
address
this
for
instance
creating
curriculum
specifically
tailored
for
different
ages
can
be
beneficial
additionally
designing
lesson
plans
to
ensure
that
all
students
are
engaged
and
learning
together
can
also
be
beneficial
overall
programs
with
both
older
and
youngest
students
can
present
some
challenges
due
to
the
differences
in
knowledge
and
experience
between
the
two
age
groups
however
by
implementing
strategies
to
address
the
issue
such
as
tailoring
curriculum
and
engaging
in
lesson
plans
this
can
help
to
achieve
a
successful
learning
experience
for
all
students
the
debate
over
whether
or
not
the
school
board
should
extend
the
amount
of
time
students
are
required
to
spend
at
school
is
a
complex
one
that
needs
careful
consideration
of
multiple
perspectives
on
the
one
hand
there
are
potential
advantages
to
lengthening
the
school
day
such
as
additional
classes
and
extracurriculars
for
students
to
participate
in
and
increased
teacher student
engagement
on
the
other
hand
there
are
certainly
some
negative
consequences
if
the
school
day
is
extended
such
as
more
stress
and
burnout
for
both
staff
and
students
ultimately
the
opinion
of
the
students
themselves
should
be
taken
into
consideration
when
making
this
decision
after
all
they
are
the
ones
who
will
be
most
impacted
by
this
change
family
time
together
is
an
excellent
way
to
overcome
fear
and
create
memories
that
will
be
treasured
for
a
lifetime
activities
such
as
taking
a
hike
in
the
woods
going
to
your
local
pool
or
beach
or
having
a
game
night
can
help
bring
people
closer
together
and
enable
everyone
to
enjoy
some
quality
time
together
going
on
a
camping
trip
or
a
road
trip
can
also
be
great
ways
to
explore
and
create
special
memories
taking
a
class
or
learning
a
new
skill
together
can
help
build
relationships
and
build
a
support
system
when
it
comes
to
overcoming
fears
making
memories
with
family
and
friends
is
an
important
part
of
life
they
do
n t
have
to
be
extravagant
just
meaningful
failure
is
an
inevitable
part
of
life
and
it
can
be
an
integral
component
of
success
every
mistake
or
setback
is
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
and
through
the
process
of
trial
and
error
we
can
build
the
necessary
skills
and
resources
needed
for
success
the
role
of
enthusiasm
and
effort
is
paramount
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
even
when
goals
are
not
met
enthusiasm
and
persistence
can
keep
us
motivated
and
encourage
us
to
keep
trying
by
continuing
to
strive
for
our
goals
we
are
able
to
gain
the
experience
confidence
and
resilience
needed
to
persevere
through
the
difficulties
associated
with
failure
ultimately
the
journey
to
success
is
one
of
continual
growth
learning
and
self discovery
and
sometimes
our
biggest
successes
come
from
moments
of
failure
it
is
important
to
remember
that
focusing
on
what
we
can
do
with
failure
learning
from
our
mistakes
and
bouncing
back
with
newfound
resilience
is
the
key
to
unlocking
greater
successes
in
life
with
enthusiasm
and
effort
as
two
of
our
closest
companions
we
can
turn
failure
into
the
stepping
stone
to
success
first
impressions
are
often
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
any
interaction
we
often
form
an
instant
opinion
before
we
even
have
a
chance
to
know
the
person
this
leads
to
the
understanding
that
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
when
it
comes
to
natural
first
impressions
there
are
many
beliefs
that
come
to
mind
people
often
choose
to
judge
first
impressions
based
on
a
person
s
physical
appearance
clothes
or
accents
while
these
distinguishing
factors
can
give
a
first
impression
of
someone
they
do
not
always
provide
a
clear
indication
of
an
individual
s
character
the
mind
plays
a
critical
role
in
forming
first
impressions
our
subconscious
often
perceives
certain
things
and
can
affect
our
opinions
without
us
being
aware
of
it
this
can
lead
to
an
inaccurate
first
impression
based
on
a
false
assumption
lastly
people
are
simply
not
prepared
for
the
first
impressions
they
experience
it
is
difficult
to
truly
know
what
to
expect
in
any
situations
and
the
presence
of
first
impressions
can
be
jarring
this
can
make
it
difficult
for
people
to
adjust
to
their
initial
impression
and
accept
the
other
person
for
who
they
really
are
in
conclusion
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
due
to
their
reliance
on
external
appearance
the
role
of
the
mind
in
judgments
and
people
not
being
prepared
for
the
results
understanding
the
power
of
first
impressions
can
help
people
from
forming
quick
assumptions
and
help
form
stronger
relationships
one
possible
way
schools
can
balance
school
meals
is
by
implementing
a
points
system
this
system
would
allow
students
to
use
points
to
purchase
their
favorite
snacks
while
also
incentivizing
them
to
select
healthier
options
with
more
points
by
putting
foods
into
assigned
categories
and
setting
different
point
values
for
each
schools
could
help
guide
students
to
make
healthier
choices
while
also
allowing
students
freedom
to
choose
the
biggest
advantage
of
a
points
system
is
that
it
would
create
student specific
meal
plans
taking
into
account
each
student
s
dietary
needs
and
preferences
it
could
also
potentially
reduce
the
amount
of
food
waste
in
school
since
students
would
only
be
purchasing
items
they
actually
want
to
eat
additionally
it
would
encourage
healthier
snacking
while
also
allowing
for
the
occasional
treat
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
drawbacks
of
a
points
system
as
well
by
incentivizing
healthy
choices
there
is
a
risk
that
students
will
be
more
likely
to
go
for
the
healthier
options
simply
because
they
get
more
points
furthermore
with
rising
food
prices
it
may
be
difficult
for
students
from
lower income
households
to
afford
the
more
expensive
healthier
snacks
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
effectiveness
of
the
points
system
can
vary
among
different
students
and
depending
on
the
school
a
points
system
could
be
a
viable
way
to
provide
healthy
food
options
in
schools
while
still
allowing
students
to
enjoy
their
favorite
snacks
it
is
important
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
pros
and
cons
of
this
option
as
well
as
the
impact
it
could
have
on
students
physical
overall
and
academic
health
graduating
from
high
school
and
college
are
important
steps
for
achieving
career
goals
and
financial
success
in
life
having
a
high
school
diploma
and
higher
education
can
open
doors
to
many
opportunities
from
higher
paying
jobs
to
increased
job
security
and
better
options
for
college
and
further
education
learning
a
new
language
such
as
french
and
focusing
on
the
similarities
to
spanish
can
help
build
better
relationships
with
people
open
up
job
prospects
and
broaden
one
s
outlook
on
the
world
to
help
parents
creating
a
budget
and
sticking
to
it
offering
to
help
them
with
expenses
and
engaging
in
thoughtful
conversations
about
their
plans
for
the
future
can
all
show
support
finally
assisting
immigrant
shelters
by
donating
volunteering
fundraise
and
educating
the
public
on
the
importance
of
providing
aid
and
help
for
those
in
need
is
a
great
way
to
show
compassion
and
help
refugees
in
need
being
an
individual
is
a
vital
part
of
having
a
strong
sense
of
self confidence
and
independence
people
should
not
be
ashamed
of
the
traits
that
make
them
unique
instead
those
traits
should
be
embraced
this
mindset
can
be
difficult
to
maintain
in
a
world
where
there
is
pressure
to
conform
to
group
standards
as
famed
american
essayist
once
eloquently
stated
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
it
is
human
nature
to
seek
approval
from
our
peers
and
loved
ones
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
should
strive
to
live
our
lives
in
a
way
that
is
true
to
who
we
are
this
endeavor
can
be
a
daunting
task
it
takes
courage
to
be
our
true
selves
when
faced
with
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
life
however
understanding
our
own
values
and
feelings
can
ultimately
lead
to
a
more
meaningful
life
if
we
continue
to
deny
our
own
thoughts
and
feelings
we
risk
letting
go
of
our
authenticity
and
hard earned
independence
as
said
it
is
easy
in
the
world
to
live
after
the
world
s
opinion
it
is
easy
in
solitude
to
live
after
our
own
but
the
great
man
is
he
who
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
keeps
with
perfect
sweetness
the
independence
of
solitude
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
our
inner
voice
and
remain
true
to
our
core
beliefs
no
matter
the
consequences
from
the
earliest
stories
of
humanity
characters
have
been
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
storytelling
traits
such
as
bravery
or
generosity
are
the
fundamental
building
blocks
of
any
great
character
these
traits
not
only
allow
us
to
sympathize
and
connect
with
our
protagonists
but
they
can
also
play
an
important
role
in
how
the
story
progresses
by
choosing
the
right
traits
for
our
characters
we
can
ensure
that
our
stories
will
be
interesting
engaging
and
meaningful
a
good
example
of
this
is
seen
in
s
classic
story
of
as
a
brave
determined
and
shrewd
adventurer
is
able
to
survive
many
of
his
confrontations
with
mythical
creatures
and
adversaries
his
unwavering
courage
and
wit
are
the
main
driving
forces
behind
his
successes
and
ultimately
help
him
achieve
his
goals
without
these
traits
his
adventures
may
have
been
less
exciting
and
perhaps
may
have
even
ended
differently
traits
also
often
act
as
moral
indicators
heroes
tend
to
be
brave
noble
and
just those
traits
often
being
part
of
what
makes
them
heroic
villains
are
often
shown
to
be
cowardly
selfish
and
cruel traits
that
mark
them
as
the
antagonists
this
is
true
not
only
in
literature
but
also
in
everyday
life
by
displaying
appropriate
character
traits
we
can
prove
ourselves
to
be
virtuous
and
trustworthy
individuals
in
conclusion
character
traits
are
an
essential
part
of
storytelling
and
can
have
a
profound
influence
on
how
characters
are
portrayed
and
how
stories
progress
selecting
the
right
character
traits
can
be
key
to
creating
an
emotionally
engaging
story
that
resonates
with
readers
furthermore
displaying
appropriate
character
traits
in
everyday
life
can
be
beneficial
in
displaying
one
s
own
moral
code
and
character
thus
the
significance
of
character
traits
should
not
be
overlooked
across
the
country
are
considering
the
option
of
adding
additional
hours
to
the
school
day
if
the
school
board
were
to
go
through
with
this
it
would
undoubtedly
have
a
huge
impact
on
everyone
involved
students
teachers
and
the
school
itself
for
students
the
most
obvious
consequence
would
be
an
increase
in
homework
and
studying
due
to
the
longer
day
furthermore
it
would
result
in
a
decrease
in
available
leisure
time
and
possibly
an
increased
sense
of
burnout
amongst
students
teachers
also
would
feel
the
effects
of
the
longer
day
the
extra
hours
would
mean
more
lesson
planning
more
grading
and
teaching
for
longer
periods
of
time
without
the
respite
that
they
usually
have
in
between
classes
it
could
also
cause
tensions
between
teachers
and
students
as
expectations
of
the
students
rise
with
the
additional
hours
the
school
itself
may
benefit
from
the
extra
hours
in
terms
of
improved
academic
performance
and
increased
attendance
but
it
could
also
be
a
financial
strain
as
the
extra
hours
may
require
the
school
board
to
hire
additional
staff
and
put
extra
strain
on
the
existing
budget
ultimately
the
decision
to
add
additional
hours
to
the
school
day
would
be
a
drastic
change
for
everyone
involved
that
would
have
far reaching
consequences
is
an
iconic
figure
of
the
early
century
as
a
theologian
philosopher
medical
doctor
and
musical
scholar
he
dedicated
his
life
to
service
for
others
one
of
his
core
beliefs
and
guiding
philosophies
was
that
personal
conduct
was
the
best
way
to
influence
the
world
around
you
strongly
believed
in
the
power
of
leading
by
example
and
emphasized
the
need
for
altruism
and
generosity
from
each
individual
in
his
book
out
of
and
writes
we
can
only
influence
others
through
our
personal
behavior
and
we
alone
can
prove
the
validity
of
our
beliefs
through
the
honesty
of
our
lives
these
words
still
carry
a
powerful
message
today
during
a
time
when
it
often
seems
easier
to
express
opinion
than
to
follow
through
and
act
on
it
whether
this
perspective
is
still
valid
today
is
a
matter
of
much
debate
on
the
one
hand
many
would
argue
that
personal
conduct
is
not
enough
to
positively
influence
a
larger
population
it
might
take
more
strategic
action
and
organizational
reform
to
serve
a
greater
purpose
in
society
on
the
other
hand
those
in
favor
of
s
outlook
might
point
to
the
power
of
small
consistent
actions
over
time
maybe
personal
integrity
and
honest
effort
still
can
be
an
effective
means
of
creating
positive
change
in
the
world
the
truth
is
that
s
perspective
is
still
relevant
today
in
many
ways
positive
action
kindness
and
self awareness
all
still
matter
and
can
still
be
meaningful
forces
in
the
world
around
us
ultimately
it
is
up
to
each
individual
to
decide
whether
living
with
integrity
and
striving
to
do
good
will
be
the
best
way
to
influence
the
future
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
recent
years
with
many
parents
turning
to
this
option
as
an
alternative
to
traditional
public
schooling
proponents
of
homeschooling
point
to
several
advantages
over
traditional
schooling
including
a
student centered
learning
environment
greater
flexibility
more
personalized
academic
resources
and
lower
stress
levels
however
homeschooling
also
comes
with
some
disadvantages
including
a
lack
of
social
interaction
fewer
learning
opportunities
outside
of
the
home
and
limited
access
to
subject
material
and
resources
another
factor
to
consider
is
the
effect
of
homeschooling
on
student
stress
studies
have
found
that
homeschooling
can
reduce
anxiety
as
well
as
disruptive
behaviors
in
students
this
is
due
in
part
to
the
lack
of
distractions
in
the
home
environment
and
the
ability
to
learn
at
a
pace
that
suits
each
individual
however
there
can
also
be
drawbacks
to
homeschooling
such
as
feeling
isolated
or
not
having
access
to
external
support
systems
overall
both
traditional
and
homeschooling
can
be
beneficial
to
students
if
designed
properly
it
is
important
for
parents
to
evaluate
the
pros
and
cons
of
both
systems
and
decide
which
is
best
for
their
child
taking
all
of
these
factors
into
consideration
it
is
clear
that
homeschooling
is
a
viable
option
for
many
families
and
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
student
development
failure
is
an
essential
part
of
the
journey
to
success
initially
failure
can
be
demoralizing
but
it
is
also
a
chance
to
learn
and
grow
taking
calculated
risks
trying
new
endeavors
and
stepping
out
of
one
s
comfort
zone
all
lead
to
possible
failure
and
ultimately
our
biggest
successes
one
example
of
success
through
failure
is
s
invention
of
the
electric
light
bulb
after
numerous
failed
attempts
was
undeterred
and
finally
achieved
success
when
he
figured
out
a
way
to
improve
the
carbonized
filament
in
addition
to
his
newfound
success
also
gained
wisdom
and
experience
from
his
failures
allowing
him
to
continually
innovate
and
improve
on
his
inventions
another
example
of
failure
leading
to
success
is
the
story
of
s
movie
and
the
even
though
the
movie
s
plot
was
revolutionary
for
its
time
encountered

how
failure
can
actually
fuel
the
motivation
to
keep
trying
when
faced
with

disappointment
and
delay
success
is
only
possible
if
we
can
rise
up
and
embrace
failure
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
strive
for
an
even
better
outcome
we
must
accept
failure
as
part
of
the
process
and
use
it
to
our
advantage
failure
is
not
an
endpoint
but
a
bridge
to
success
in
recent
years
many
schools
have
attempted
to
improve
student
health
by
introducing
a
brand new
health conscious
menu
to
the
school
lunchroom
while
some
may
appreciate
the
change
others
are
vehemently
opposed
believing
that
endangering
the
established
school
lunch
menu
is
an
unnecessary
move
indicates
that
many
students
simply
do
not
like
the
taste
of
the
new
dishes
and
fail
to
find
them
appetizing
furthermore
the
introduction
of
these
dishes
has
also
failed
to
take
into
account
the
traditional
favorites
of
many
students
according
to
a
survey
conducted
by
over
two thirds
of
students
dislike
certain
dishes
on
the
school
s
menu
this
has
created
a
negative
atmosphere
one
in
which
kids
dread
lunchtime
rather
than
look
forward
to
it
the
move
to
a
healthier
menu
has
also
not
been
proven
to
be
beneficial
in
the
short
or
long
term
a
study
conducted
by
the
of
reveals
that
while
healthier
choices
may
promote
better
eating
habits
in
the
long
run
students
do
not
immediately
feel
compelled
to
choose
more
nutritious
options
when
given
the
chance
one
possible
solution
would
be
to
introduce
healthier
options
without
taking
away
existing
favorite
dishes
this
could
include
incorporating
nutritious
ingredients
into
the
cooking
process
for
instance
introducing
salads
and
wraps
to
the
menu
with
hints
of
carrot
celery
and
lettuce
or
adding
fruits
and
vegetables
to
existing
dishes
this
type
of
adaptation
would
make
dishes
more
nutritious
without
having
to
completely
change
the
menu
ultimately
the
introduction
of
healthier
options
to
the
school
lunch
menu
is
an
unnecessary
switch
with
more
drawbacks
than
rewards
and
may
be
more
of
a
hindrance
to
students
rather
than
a
help
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
the
traditional
dishes
that
students
may
enjoy
in
addition
to
introducing
new
healthier
options
in
order
to
make
lunchtime
an
enjoyable
experience
for
all
taking
an
extra
one
and
a
half
hours
per
school
day
would
have
many
pitfalls
that
students
and
parents
must
consider
with
such
a
long
school
day
students
especially
young
ones
would
be
walking
home
in
the
dark
which
poses
serious
risks
to
their
safety
on
top
of
that
students
would
be
robbed
of
additional
time
spent
with
friends
family
and
exploring
personal
hobbies
or
leisure
activities
furthermore
the
strain
of
the
significantly
longer
day
could
cause
students
to
become
disinterested
in
school
which
could
result
in
higher
dropout
rates
it
is
essential
for
students
to
be
able
to
use
their
scarce
free
time
to
pursue
interests
goals
and
relationships
that
allow
them
to
have
life
experiences
and
develop
a
better
understanding
of
the
world
the
lack
of
available
time
after
school
significantly
reduces
these
important
opportunities
furthermore
students
may
not
have
enough
time
and
energy
to
participate
in
sports
teams
or
practice
instruments
which
can
lead
to
disinterest
in
their
academic
career
in
conclusion
adding
an
extra
one
and
a
half
hours
of
school
could
have
serious
detrimental
effects
on
the
lives
of
students
both
academically
and
socially
the
lack
of
available
time
for
leisure
activities
relationships
and
sports
could
result
in
disinterest
in
school
and
a
reduced
capacity
to
learn
therefore
despite
the
potential
benefits
of
having
a
longer
school
day
the
drawbacks
are
simply
too
great
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
success
in
life
this
is
evidenced
by
many
successful
people
who
have
had
a
positive
outlook
on
life
and
achieved
their
dreams
they
have
seen
hardships
as
learning
opportunities
instead
of
roadblocks
in
their
way
to
success
evidence
suggests
that
there
are
many
benefits
to
having
a
positive
attitude
not
only
in
terms
of
personal
growth
and
development
but
also
in
increasing
opportunities
for
success
in
the
professional
world
adopting
a
positive
attitude
does
come
with
challenges
it
requires
a
high
degree
of
self reflection
and
self awareness
to
stay
aware
of
one
s
own
thoughts
and
feelings
this
ability
to
be
mindful
is
essential
when
striving
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
practicing
self control
and
having
an
open
mindset
are
important
steps
for
an
individual
to
take
when
attempting
to
develop
a
positive
attitude
to
continue
to
keep
and
build
a
positive
attitude
it
is
best
to
employ
strategies
such
as
goal setting
and
creating
daily
routines
visualizing
success
and
implementing
self care
techniques
can
also
benefit
one
s
mental
outlook
on
life
finally
seeking
support
and
guidance
from
positive
role
models
can
lead
to
a
more
optimistic
outlook
on
life
and
help
develop
a
positive
attitude
overall
the
evidence
seems
to
suggest
that
having
a
positive
attitude
even
in
the
toughest
of
times
can
be
extremely
beneficial
to
an
individual
s
personal
and
professional
life
it
helps
to
shift
perspective
and
open
doors
of
opportunity
though
it
requires
a
conscious
effort
to
build
and
maintain
positive
attitude
can
truly
be
the
key
to
success
in
life
but
only
if
it
is
backed
by
action
and
determination
a
debate
has
been
raging
for
years
over
whether
or
not
young
students
should
commit
to
a
career
while
in
school
supporters
of
committing
to
a
career
at
an
early
age
argue
that
it
allows
students
to
focus
on
their
chosen
field
of
study
and
gain
valuable
experience
while
opponents
worry
that
it
leads
to
students
missing
out
on
important
experiences
and
opportunities
on
one
hand
making
the
decision
to
commit
to
a
specific
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
beneficial
it
allows
students
to
access
mentorships
and
internships
that
can
help
them
gain
valuable
learning
experiences
and
industry
connections
it
also
helps
them
stay
focused
on
their
studies
and
avoid
the
risk
of
getting
sidetracked
making
a
commitment
also
allows
students
to
make
a
more
informed
career
choice
as
they
gain
experience
in
their
field
prior
to
entering
the
job
market
on
the
other
hand
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
a
risky
move
young
students
may
not
be
aware
of
all
the
career
paths
available
to
them
and
may
make
a
decision
not
best
suited
to
their
talents
or
interests
additionally
committing
to
one
field
can
limit
the
range
of
opportunities
and
experiences
students
can
explore
young
students
may
not
have
the
maturity
or
experience
needed
to
make
an
informed
career
choice
in
conclusion
while
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
beneficial
in
some
ways
there
is
also
a
risk
of
missing
out
on
important
experiences
and
opportunity
therefore
it
is
important
for
students
to
do
their
research
and
carefully
consider
all
the
pros
and
cons
of
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
when
i
look
back
on
my
life
and
evaluate
how
far
i
have
come
i
can
confidently
attribute
my
success
to
working
hard
having
confidence
and
taking
the
initiative
to
do
something
to
drive
the
results
i
wanted
after
graduating
college
i
had
a
dream
of
starting
my
own
business
i
knew
it
would
require
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
long
hours
to
make
it
successful
i
was
confident
that
i
had
the
right
skills
and
knowledge
then
i
did
something
i
took
a
leap
of
faith
and
started
my
own
business
the
result
of
my
hard
work
and
confidence
was
great
success i
managed
to
make
my
business
thrive
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
i
have
witnessed
many
people
expecting
results
but
taking
no
action
without
doing
hard
work
and
having
confidence
these
people
made
false
assumptions
that
the
universe
would
simply
line
up
and
present
them
with
a
successful
end result
unfortunately
these
people
often
end
up
achieving
nothing
as
they
never
had
any
agency
to
try
and
do
something
it
s
better
to
put
in
the
work
than
rely
on
the
expectation
of
results
without
doing
something
to
get
more
working
with
a
partner
on
school
projects
and
assignments
can
be
extremely
beneficial
for
a
variety
of
reasons
for
starters
it
alleviates
the
amount
of
work
any
one
individual
has
to
do
and
provides
an
opportunity
for
division
of
labor
from
personal
experience
working
with
a
partner
has
helped
me
stay
organized
and
on
top
of
tasks
in
half
the
time
my
partner
and
i
split
up
tasks
and
multiple
times
our
efficiency
and
productivity
level
was
superior
to
if
i
had
done
all
the
work
on
my
own
another
benefit
of
working
with
a
partner
is
that
it
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
each
other
and
come
up
with
creative
ideas
in
a
process
of
collaboration
not
only
do
my
partners
and
i
learn
new
skills
but
we
also
benefit
from
each
other
s
perspectives
and
life
experiences
working
with
a
team
of
at
least
three
people
on
bigger
projects
and
assignments
also
has
its
advantages
by
having
a
larger
number
of
people
contributing
to
the
project
or
assignment
it
opens
up
the
possibility
to
gather
more
resources
cover
more
ground
and
think
innovatively
in
teams
with
at
least
people
individuals
can
work
together
to
truly
diversify
the
skills
knowledge
methods
of
tackling
issues
and
overall
resources
in
order
to
produce
an
effective
and
quality
product
or
assignment
considering
the
collaboration
and
mutual
learning
that
come
with
teams
of
at
least
three
this
is
beneficial
for
students
in
various
ways

abilities
that
could

useful
for
working
with

development
and
troubleshooting
the
tools
and

within
products
vary
depending
on
the
specific
product
but
include
things
such
as
programming
languages
debuggers
and
automation
suites
to
fix
broken
products
expert
knowledge
may
be
required
but
there
are
various
online
forums
and
resources
to
help
users
find
troubleshooting
solutions
while
the
average
person
may
have
a
basic
knowledge
of
those
with
more
experience
typically
know
how
to
effectively
use
the
products
and
software
to
their
fullest

extracurricular
activities
can
offer
a
wealth
of
benefits
to
students
including
improving
academic
performance
developing
social
skills
and
providing
a
positive
outlet
for
energy
on
the
other
hand
students
may
not
have
the
time
or
resources
available
to
participate
in
these
activities
in
terms
of
benefits
research
has
demonstrated
that
students
who
are
involved
in
extracurricular
activities
often
have
improved
academic
performance
due
to
increased
focus
and
motivation
it
is
also
an
effective
way
for
students
to
develop
social
skills
in
a
safe
and
supportive
environment
finally
extracurricular
activities
can
provide
a
positive
outlet
for
energy
resulting
in
improved
mental
and
physical
wellbeing
on
the
other
hand
extracurricular
activities
may
not
be
feasible
for
all
students
time
constraints
such
as
having
to
work
or
care
for
family
members
can
hinder
a
student
s
ability
to
participate
some
students
may
not
be
able
to
afford
required
fees
or
equipment
finally
research
has
shown
that
extracurricular
activities
can
place
pressure
on
students
resulting
in
stress
and
other
negative
psychological
effects
in
conclusion
while
extracurricular
activities
can
offer
a
variety
of
benefits
students
should
be
mindful
of
the
potential
drawbacks
that
could
arise
from
participating
service
is
an
incredibly
important
part
of
developing
character
in
students
it
provides
them
with
the
opportunity
to
learn
valuable
skills
to
practice
selflessness
and
to
help
make
the
world
a
better
place
of
all
students
who
perform
community
service
learn
important
skills
that
they
can
take
with
them
into
the
future
serving
their
community
gives
them
experience
in
cooperation
teamwork
and
compassion
additionally
they
gain
skills
such
as
problem
solving
and
communication
which
can
help
them
with
further
education
and
career
paths
additionally
community
service
encourages
students
to
be
selfless
it
can
serve
as
a
reminder
that
no
matter
what
their
own
individual
needs
there
is
always
a
way
to
be
helpful
to
those
around
them
when
students
focus
on
contributing
to
society
they
can
see
that
their
actions
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
world
around
them
finally
through
community
service
students
can
help
make
the
world
a
better
place
by
helping
out
in
their
communities
they
are
taking
a
personal
stance
on
creating
a
brighter
future
for
the
people
around

this
can
foster
a
sense
of
shared
responsibility
and
a
desire
to
be
an
active
part
of
helping
their
community
in
conclusion
students
should
be
encouraged
and
required
to
perform
community
service
it
can
provide
them
with
the
skills
and
selflessness
needed
to
be
successful
in
the
future
while
at
the
same
time
creating
a
brighter
world
around
them
drama
and
art
classes
have
a
wide
variety
of
benefits
to
offer
when
it
comes
to
educating
students
so
it
comes
as
no
surprise
that
they
are
taught
in
schools
around
the
world
however
the
debate
of
whether
these
creative
courses
should
be
electives
rather
than
mandatory
courses
continues
to
be
a
topical
issue
electives
provide
students
a
wider
range
of
interests
to
explore
and
the
opportunity
to
customize
their
educational
journey
by
allowing
students
to
choose
which
electives
they
take
they
are
free
to
pick
the
skill sets
they
are
most
passionate
about
and
that
best
match
their
goals
having
the
freedom
to
make
their
own
decisions
is
a
valuable
learning
opportunity
for
students
and
teaches
them
the
skill
of
prioritizing
and
decision
making
in
a
safe
and
supervised
environment
moreover
by
being
able
to
choose
classes
for
which
they
have
a
personal
interest
students
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
the
material
and
take
interest
in
learning
it
counselors
or
teachers
can
be
of
great
help
in
narrowing
down
the
selection
of
electives
and
helping
students
find
the
courses
that
best
fit
their
individual
interests
by
offering
personalized
support
they
can
guide
students
towards
exploring
subjects
that
they
would
otherwise
be
unaware
of
or
reluctant
to
take
in
addition
to
traditional
music
drama
and
arts
courses
other
types
of
electives
could
be
offered
that
target
some
of
the
most
popular
student
interests
such
as
robotics
computer
programming
and
athletic
programs
by
offering
students
a
variety
of
creative
and
innovative
courses
schools
can
accommodate
individual
interests
and
provide
a
balanced
learning
environment
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
assigning
music
drama
and
art
classes
as
electives
rather
than
mandatory
courses
would
provide
students
with
a
better
educational
experience
through
these
electives
students
can
pursue
the
activities
or
talents
that
best
suit
their
individual
talents
explore
innovative
subjects
that
peak
their
interests
and
gain
valuable
experience
in
decision
making
failure
is
a
fact
of
life
and
even
successes
such
as
soccer
players
people
in
government
and
other
famous
people
have
faced
failure
in
their
lives
however
failure
can
be
the
key
to
education
and
success
when
properly
leveraged
when
faced
with
a
setback
the
key
is
framing
it
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
to
do
this
one
must
take
the
time
to
analyze
the
situation
identify
where
mistakes
were
made
and
develop
a
strategy
to
move
forward
an
important
part
of
this
process
is
to
be
patient
with
oneself
and
to
recognize
that
the
process
of
overcoming
failure
is
not
instantaneous
but
requires
time
and
dedication
one
useful
strategy
for
facing
failure
and
overcoming
obstacles
is
to
become
familiar
with
one
s
own
strengths
and
weaknesses
by
understanding
which
areas
might
need
further
development
one
can
make
an
effort
to
seek
out
resources
and
mentors
who
can
provide
valuable
insights
on
how
to
move
forward
and
make
the
best
of
a
difficult
situation
secondly
it
is
beneficial
to
set
achievable
goals
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
to
accomplish
them
setbacks
should
be
seen
as
a
learning
experience
and
treated
as
part
of
the
journey
rather
than
a
sign
of
failure
finally
once
a
strategy
has
been
developed
it
is
important
to
take
action
monotonous
tasks
such
as
developing
and
following
a
daily
routine
can
be
particularly
helpful
in
developing
healthy
habits
and
cues
to
remind
oneself
of
the
progress
that
has
been
made
after
all
failure
does
not
have
to
be
the
end
but
can
be
the
beginning
of
a
new
path
to
personal
success
by
learning
from
failure
one
can
gain
a
valuable
education
and
the
patience
necessary
to
move
forward
growing
up
i
was
constantly
told
what
i
should
do
with
my
life
from
parents
to
teachers
to
my
peers
i
felt
like
the
world
was
trying
to
direct
me
in
my
own
path
everyone
had
an
opinion
choose
this
career
do
n t
get
too
many
tattoos
go
to
the
right
college
and
i
felt
like
i
had
to
follow
what
i
was
told
however
over
time
i
ve
learned
that
it
s
important
to
stay
true
to
myself
and
focus
on
my
own
goals
regardless
of
what
the
world
says
for
example
when
i
was
deciding
on
a
college
major
i
felt
like
i
had
to
stick
with
a
traditional
degree
such
as
engineering
or
business
but
deep
down
i
knew
that
i
wanted
to
pursue
a
degree
in
the
humanities
an
area
that
many
people
have
often
deemed
as
unrealistic
in
the
end
i
decided
to
take
a
risk
and
completely
forgo
the
advice
of
others
embracing
my
love
of
literature
instead
by
trusting
my
gut
and
focusing
on
my
true
goals
i
have
been
able
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
succeed
in
my
education
and
beyond
i
have
found
that
it
is
essential
to
listen
to
those
around
you
while
also
giving
yourself
the
freedom
to
make
your
own
decisions
it
may
be
difficult
to
go
against
the
current
but
in
the
end
it
is
worth
it
if
you
remain
true
to
yourself
and
your
own
goals
a
positive
attitude
can
have
profoundly
positive
effects
on
a
person
s
life
a
positive
attitude
has
been
linked
to
increased
resilience
and
improved
performance
in
a
variety
of
contexts
including
work
education
relationships
and
happiness
adopting
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
better
opportunities
increased
self confidence
improved
problem solving
and
a
greater
sense
of
well being
for
example
taking
an
optimistic
outlook
on
a
challenge
can
equip
a
person
with
the
right
mindset
for
achieving
their
goals
in
contrast
having
a
negative
attitude
can
lead
to
lower
motivation
decreased
confidence
and
further
difficulties
in
reaching
desired
outcomes
it
can
also
create
a
negative
spiral
of
self defeating
thoughts
and
behaviors
making
it
harder
for
a
person
to
succeed
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
is
therefore
essential
in
enabling
a
person
to
reach
their
ambitions
and
cultivate
a
happier
life
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
becoming
successful
in
life
is
to
have
a
positive
attitude
having
an
optimistic
perspective
allows
us
to
discover
opportunities
we
may
have
otherwise
overlooked
and
provides
us
with
the
courage
to
take
risks
and
push
through
difficult
times
we
may
also
find
that
a
positive
outlook
brings
more
happiness
and
respect
not
just
from
those
around
us
but
also
from
ourselves
a
great
example
of
how
positivity
impacts
our
success
is
that
of
setting
goals
a
positive
attitude
allows
us
to
focus
on
our
goals
look
at
every
setback
as
an
opportunity
for
growth
and
be
truly
passionate
about
what
we
are
striving
for
this
makes
us
more
motivated
creative
and
confident
which
in
turn
gives
us
the
necessary
tools
to
reach
our
desired
destination
on
the
other
hand
having
a
negative
attitude
puts
us
in
an
energy draining
downward
spiral
where
we
focus
on
failures
and
obstacles
rather
than
proactive
solutions
this
can
not
only
limit
us
from
accomplishing
our
goals
but
also
lead
us
to
lose
sight
of
our
hopes
dreams
and
aspirations
therefore
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
achieving
happiness
respect
and
success
in
life
it
can
open
doors
to
new
beginnings
help
us
stay
resilient
amidst
hardships
and
give
us
the
energy
to
overcome
any
challenge
when
we
choose
positively
we
begin
to
see
the
world
through
a
lens
of
endless
possibilities one
that
can
help
us
to
experience
true
fulfillment
within
our
lives
when
we
ask
the
question
of
whether
our
character
traits
are
chosen
or
created
by
outside
influences
we
are
presented
with
an
interesting
dilemma
on
one
hand
we
could
argue
that
we
do
have
the
capability
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
form
our
own
character
traits
we
have
control
over
our
actions
and
our
reactions
to
the
world
around
us
and
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
we
can
shape
our
own
character
traits
at
least
to
some
degree
on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
true
that
our
character
traits
are
at
least
partially
formed
by
our
environment
we
can
not
be
separated
from
the
people
and
the
situations
that
affect
us
every
day
it
is
inevitable
that
these
will
have
an
impact
on
our
thoughts
our
behavior
and
our
character
taking
both
sides
of
the
argument
into
consideration
i
believe
that
our
character
traits
to
an
extent
are
both
chosen
and
formed
by
outside
influences
we
have
the
power
to
decide
our
own
actions
and
the
way
we
act
in
certain
situations
but
it
is
also
true
that
we
can
not
separate
ourselves
from
the
world
around
us
which
shapes
us
just
as
much
as
we
shape
ourselves
this
balance
between
nature
and
nurture
is
something
that
is
often
seen
in
many
aspects
of
our
lives
in
conclusion
our
character
traits
are
a
combination
of
both
our
own
decisions
and
the
environment
around
us
it
is
important
to
consider
both
sides
of
the
situation
in
order
to
come
to
an
informed
conclusion
extracurricular
activities
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
students
helping
to
reduce
stress
increase
grades
and
strengthen
family
relationships
studies
show
that
students
who
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
have
lower
levels
of
stress
than
those
who
do
n t
they
also
tend
to
have
higher
grades
which
can
lead
to
improved
family
relationships
as
parents
often
take
an
interest
in
their
child
s
academic
progress
additionally
extracurricular
activities
provide
a
sense
of
purpose
and
belonging
which
can
help
a
student

overall
mental
wellbeing

activities
can
also
give
students
the
opportunity
to
build
strong
supportive
relationships
which
can
help
them
to
cope
with
stress
and
related
issues
ultimately
extracurricular
activities
can
be
an
effective
way
to
reduce
stress
boost
grades
and
strengthen
family
ties
praising
and
achieving
have
both
been
shown
to
have
positive
effects
on
the
self esteem
of
students
types
of
students
respond
differently
to
these
techniques
for
instance
some
students
respond
positively
to
praise
while
others
respond
better
to
achievements
such
as
good
grades
or
awards
of
the
type
both
techniques
are
essential
when
putting
together
a
plan
to
build
self esteem
praising
helps
students
feel
valued
and
appreciated
which
adds
to
their
sense
of
self worth
while
achieving
helps
to
motivate
and
encourage
students
giving
them
a
sense
of
accomplishment
when
put
together
these
tools
can
be
powerful
when
it
comes
to
boosting
a
student
s
self esteem
in
conclusion
praising
and
achieving
are
both
important
parts
of
building
self esteem
and
can
be
used
in
combination
to
help
students
build
confidence
and
self worth

our
impressions
of
those
around
us
can
have
a
powerful
impact
on
our
lives
oftentimes
our
impressions
of
other
people
can
be
swayed
by
our
own
thoughts
and
feelings
it
is
important
to
understand
how
our
thoughts
and
feelings
may
lead
us
to
form
impressions
of
people
that
are
not
always
accurate
in

control
our
impressions
there
are
certain
strategies

can
employ

can
explore
different
expressions
attitudes

emotions
of
people
to
help
us
form
a
more
clear
impression

s
feelings
by

honest
or
brutally
honest
at
times

like
criticism
and

relationships
that

family
can
have
both
pros
and
cons
while
it
can
lead
to
better

and
create
an
atmosphere
of
trust
and
respect
it
can
also
come
with
a
risk
factor

relationships
and
feelings
therefore
in
relationships
it
is
important
to

the
consequences
of
any
decision
before
making
them
is
an
important
factor
in
how
successful
a
person
is
in
life
it
can
influence
relationships
in
both
a
positive
and
negative
way
impacting
overall
well being
those
with
a
positive
attitude
are
more
likely
to
attract
positive
life
experiences
and
decisions
while
those
with
a
negative
attitude
can
easily
find
themselves
in
a
downward
spiral
the
implications
of
attitude
can
be
seen
both
personally
and
socially
it
can
shape
behavior
and
reactions
in
our
everyday
lives
having
good
attitude
can
be
seen
as
an
asset it
can
minimize
stress
help

open
doors

way
we
think
and
act
and
can
help
us
to
stay
optimistic
when

can
bring
obstacles
into
our
lives
it
can
affect
relationships
by
creating
tension
and
misunderstanding
and
can
even
lead
to
isolation
a
negative
attitude
can
also
be
a
barrier
for
success
and
can
cause
us
to
overlook
potential
opportunities
ultimately
attitude
plays
an
essential
role
in
how
we
experience
life
by
taking
a
conscious
approach
to
how
we
think
changing
our
perceptions
and
developing
a
positive
attitude
we
can
experience
positive
outcomes
and
greater
well being
but
it
is
up
to
us
to
take
control
of
our
attitude
and
make
each
day
count
as
school
budgets
are
stretched
some
schools
are
considering
changes
to
the
food
offered
in
cafeterias
while
this
can
be
a
good
way
to
cut
costs
there
are
also
potential
negative
outcomes
to
consider
one
outcome
could
be
that
students
may
be
less
likely
to
eat
the
food
offered
if
they
are
not
accustomed
to
the
new
items
if
students
do
n t
eat
the
food
served
in
the
cafeteria
they
may
not
be
getting
the
proper
nutrition
they
need
throughout
the
day
furthermore
if
students
are
not
fully
nourished
it
could
potentially
lead
to
poorer
academic
performance
another
potential
outcome
is
that
the
quality
of
the
food
offered
may
decrease
leading
to
unhealthy
eating
habits
food
that
is
low
in
nutrition
and
high
in
unhealthy
ingredients
can
not
only
be
detrimental
to
physical
health
but
can
also
impact
students
mental
health
and
wellbeing
lastly
introducing
new
foods
or
changing
the
menu
could
cause
disruption
or
even
dissatisfaction
among
students
this
could
potentially
lead
to
diminished
morale
and
a
less
positive
school
environment
in
conclusion
before
making
any
changes
to
cafeteria
food
school
administrators
must
weigh
the
potential
positives
against
the
potential
negatives
for
much
of
the
century
technology
slowly
evolved
to
become
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
we
soon
saw
that
the
advancements
of
technology
had
a
profound
impact
on
the
way
we
communicate
from
text
messaging
to
social
media
technology
has
greatly
increased
our
ability
to
interact
with
others
one
of
the
positives
of
technology
is
that
it
has
allowed
us
to
connect
with
people
who
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
do
without
it
by
using
digital
media
we
can
confidently
express
our
true
selves
without
the
fear
of
judgement
or
rejection
from
those
disconnecting
with
us
in
real
life
this
has
opened
up
the
possibilities
to
form
relationships
with
people
thousands
of
miles
away
and
it
has
allowed
us
to
stay
in
touch
with
those
who
may
not
be
as
close
to
us
however
there
can
be
potential
negative
implications
such
as
limiting
real life
interactions
and
creating
a
false
sense
of
connection
or
isolation
to
prevent
the
potential
downsides
it
is
important
to
maintain
physical
interaction
by
talking
to
people
in
person
meeting
up
for
coffee
or
attending
events
technology
should
be
viewed
as
a
tool
to
enhance
our
lives
and
not
replace
real life
interactions
it
is
important
for
individuals
to
follow
their
passions
in
life
no
matter
what
following
your
passion
is
essential
for
finding
true
happiness
and
satisfaction
in
your
life
one
example
of
this
is
pursuing
a
career
in
nursing
despite
any
opposition
from
family
or
friends
to
be
successful
you
need
to
have
a
passion
for
the
field
and
be
dedicated
to
the
profession
no
one
will
be
successful
in
a
field
that
they
have
no
interest
or
passion
in
having
the
drive
to
pursue
something
you
are
passionate
about
is
invaluable
never
let
anyone
tell
you
otherwise
when
you
pursue
something
that
you
are
interested
in
the
possibilities
are
endless
take
the
example
of
pursuing
a
nursing
career
if
you
have
an
interest
and
true
passion
for
the
field
despite
any
opposition

the
boundaries

impossible
or
difficult
you
can
often
find
solutions
that
were
n t
apparent
before
you
decided
to
take
on
the
challenge
for
example
have
you
ever
encountered
a
problem
that
seemed
impossible
to
solve
by
stepping
back
and
looking
at
it
in
a
different
way
you
might
find
that
you
can
come
up
with
a
creative
solution
to
the
problem
that
you
would
never
have
thought
of
before
in
addition
to
providing
creative
solutions

schools
have
a
responsibility
to
incorporate
energy
and
resource
conservation
into
their
everyday
practices
here
are
five
easy
ways
schools
can
use
to
to
begin
conserving
energy
and
resources
utilize
natural
light
by
installing
skylights
or
utilizing
natural
sunlight
wherever
possible
switch
to
lighting
which
is
energy
efficient
and
has
a
longer
life
span
teach
students
about
the
importance
of
conservation
and
ways
they
can
help
encourage
reducing
waste
properly
disposing
of
recyclables
and
using
reusable
items
wherever
possible
implement
water saving
initiatives
such
as
installing
low flow
faucets
and
toilets

and
practicing
efficient
irrigation
of

utilize
renewable
energy
sources
such
as
solar
power
or
wind
turbines
to
implement
these
changes
school
administrators
could
create
a
committee
or
task
force
made
up
of
students
and
staff
to
develop
and
promote
green
initiatives
schools
can
also
work
to
find
grants
or
other
funding
to
support
their
efforts
additionally
school
administrators
and
faculty
can
hold
special
assemblies
or
classroom
lessons
to
teach
students
about
the
importance
of
conservation
and
ways
to
get
involved
graduating
high
school
early
within
three
years
can
be
an
attractive
option
for
some
students
on
the
one
hand
graduating
early
can
enable
a
student
to
get
an
early
start
on
furthering
their
education
and
can
allow
them
to
begin
either
college
or
a
career
path
earlier
giving
them
a
head
start
in
life
on
the
other
hand
some
students
might
miss
out
on
key
educational
experiences
such
as
important
electives
or
extracurriculars
which
can
help
provide
valuable
skills
that
are
beneficial
when
entering
the
workforce
or
college
additionally
graduating
early
could
potentially
mean
a
student
misses
out
on
certain
social
experiences
such
as
participating
in
school
sporting
events
or
attending
senior
prom
ultimately
the
decision
whether
to
graduate
early
or
not
should
be
made
carefully
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
student
is
able
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
high
school
and
college
experience
with
the
implementation
of
a
four day
school
week
the
conservation
of
energy
and
resources
could
be
significantly
enhanced
the
extra
two
hours
added
to
the
school
day
could
be
used
to
provide
additional
instruction
and
educational
activities
which
might
lead
to
a
more
efficient
use
of
resources
and
energy
costs
associated
with
transportation
such
as
gas
and
tolls
and
food
could
be
reduced
as
schools
would
only
be
open
for
four
days
each
week
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
drawbacks
of
a
four day
school
week
particularly
for
students
with
part time
jobs
while
the
additional
day
off
could
give
a
student
more
time
to
pursue
an
after school
job
it
could
also
result
in
fewer
hours
and
less
pay
due
to
the
extended
school
day
ultimately
the
potential
benefits
of
a
four day
school
week
must
be
weighed
carefully
against
the
consequences
for
students
with
part time
jobs
technology
has
become
an
integral
part
of
our
everyday
lives
with
almost
every
facet
of
our
existence
affected
in
some
way
on
the
one
hand
technology
has
greatly
improved
our
lives
in
many
ways
providing
us
with
easier
access
to
information
and
more
efficient
ways
to
communicate
it
has
also
opened
up
new
opportunities
to
stay
connected
with
friends
family
and
loved
ones
no
matter
the
distances
that
lie
between
us
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
also
be
an
isolating
force
in
our
lives
as
it
replaces
traditional
interactions
with
virtual
ones
creating
an
artificial
atmosphere
it
can
also
be
a
great
distraction
leading
us
away
from
productive
activities
and
into
a
world
of
endless
scrolling
and
mindless
entertainment
the
effects
of
technology
on
our
lives
are
very
complex
and
it
is
clear
that
technology
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
influences
to
maintain
a
healthy
relationship
with
technology
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
potential
drawbacks
of
its
use
so
that
its
bright
potential
can
be
harnessed
without
all
the
unnecessary
risks
one
way
to
prevent
bullying
is
to
promote
respect
for
each
other
s
feelings
bodies
and
opinions
developing
an
environment
of
acceptance
can
help
foster
a
better
sense
of
self esteem
amongst
everyone
respectful
behavior
can
be
taught
at
an
early
age
by
highlighting
the
fact
that
teasing
name calling
and
sarcasm
can
hurt
people
s
feelings
and
should
be
avoided
this
can
help
set
the
tone
for
healthy
communication
and
positive
behavior
among
peers
moreover
it
is
important
to
create
avenues
to
provide
support
and
guidance
to
those
affected
by
bullying
professionals
counselors
and
parents
can
provide
assistance
to
those
experiencing
bullying
providing
outlets
such
as
art
or
sports
activities
may
help
create
a
space
where
kids
can
explore
their
passions
without
fear
of
being
belittled
last
but
not
least
people
can
have
fun
without
resorting
to
violence
this
includes
learning
trades
volunteering
starting
clubs
for
common
interests
or
taking
on
enjoyable
hobbies
participating
in
activities
that
bring
joy
to
people
can
help
reduce
stress
and
create
a
more
accepting
environment
for
all
for
each
other

essential
when
it
comes
to
preventing
bullying
and
creating
safe
and
secure
environments
where
everyone
can
feel
respected
through
open
communication
understanding
and
support
we
can
help
foster
a
more
welcoming
and
equitable
world
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
many
positive
benefits
in
our
lives
studies
have
shown
that
people
with
a
positive
outlook
tend
to
experience
better
physical
and
mental
health
stronger
relationships
and
greater
overall
productivity
these
individuals
also
tend
to
have
reduced
incidents
of
depression
lower
stress
levels
healthier
lifestyle
habits
and
an
increased
life
span
successful
people
often
possess
a
unique
perspective
that
helps
them
to
better
navigate
life
s
challenges
these
people
tend
to
focus
on
the
possibilities
in
each
situation
rather
than
the
negatives
furthermore
they
create
action
plans
that
are
linked
to
their
goals
and
follow
them
through
to
completion
thus
ensuring
their
desired
outcomes
ultimately
having
a
positive
attitude
can
greatly
impact
our
overall
well being
it
can
open
the
door
for
us
to
take
advantage
of
greater
opportunities

better
relationships
and
lead
to
a
healthier
happier
life
in
recent
years
the
debate
surrounding
cell
phone
usage
in
schools
has
become
increasingly
polarizing
on
the
one
hand
many
educators
and
parents
stand
firmly
against
widespread
usage
arguing
that
exposure
to
the
constant
distractions
of
phones
harms
academic
performance
on
the
other
hand
some
argue
that
with
certain
restrictions
in
place
cell
phones
offer
students
newfound
communication
capabilities
and
freedom
away
from
the
watchful
eyes
of
parents
and
faculty
when
it
comes
to
allowing
students
to
bring
their
phones
to
school
particularly
for
times
such
as
lunch
breaks
and
free
periods
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
that
must
be
taken
into
account
proponents
of
the
allowance
are
quick
to
cite
the
usefulness
of
cell
phones
in
allowing
students
to
stay
connected
with
their
academic
lives
stay
safe
and
find
mental
flagship
away
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
school
opponents
however
claim
that
allowing
phones
in
the
building
poses
a
threat
to
the
morale
of
the
school
environment
and
that
it
can
be
too
easily
abused
and
ultimately
interfere
with
students
educational
experiences
at
the
end
of
the
day
whether
or
not
a
principal
should
allow
students
to
bring
cell
phones
to
school
boils
down
to
his
or
her
individual
discretion
each
principal
must
take
into
account
the
potential
costs
and
benefits
of
allowing
cell
phones
into
the
school
and
weigh
them
with
regards
to
his
or
her
own
unique
situation
by
taking
a
nuanced
and
thoughtful
approach
to
understanding
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
a
cell
phone
allowance
principals
can
make
sure
they
make
the
best
decision
for
their
school
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
has
become
a
more
popular
option
for
many
students
however
this
can
be
associated
with
several
drawbacks
for
those
taking
this
path
the
fast tracked
schedule
means
having
less
time
for
family
activities
elective
classes
that
are
outside
of
general
academic
subjects
and
college
preparation
activities
such
as
and
prep
as
well
as
college
admissions
visits
moreover
the
intensified
workload
can
also
result
in
greater
stress
for
those
attending
school
in
three
years
rather
than
four
despite
the
potential
drawbacks
remaining
in
school
for
four
years
can
have
considerable
advantages
having
an
extra
year
of
high
school
allows
more
time
to
hone
academic
interests
thus
increasing
college
readiness
it
also
allows
students
to
take
more
elective
courses
partake
in
extracurricular
activities
and
take
part
in
college
preparation
activities
such
as
test
prep
and
college
visits
graduating
after
four
years
of
high
school
also
gives
students
more
time
to
appreciate
their
high
school
experience
and
make
lifelong
memories
deciding
on
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
have
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
it
can
provide
direction
and
motivation
allowing
a
young
person
to
create
plans
and
work
towards
achieving
a
career
goal
on
the
other
hand
there
may
not
be
job
availability
in
the
desired
field
making
success
difficult
to
attain
stability
is
also
an
issue
parents
may
not
have
the
financial
resources
to
help
cover
costs
if
the
career
requires
expensive
training
or
qualifications
furthermore
picking
a
career
too
early
can
lead
to
risks
such
as
missing
out
on
exploring
other
opportunities
or
feeling
pressured
to
make
a
specific
decision
this
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
mental
health
and
personal
growth
as
young
people
may
be
stuck
in
a
career
that
does
n t
align
with
their
interests
and
passions
it
is
therefore
important
to
carefully
weigh
all
the
potential
risks
and
benefits
when
making
this
decision
with
the
current
focus
on
college
and
career
readiness
more
and
more
students
are
finding
themselves
asking
the
same
question
should
they
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
to
many
the
idea
of
committing
to
a
career
before
graduating
high
school
is
intimidating
on
one
hand
committing
to
a
career
early
can
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
gain
valuable
and
relevant
experience
in
their
chosen
field
upon
graduation
additionally
many
students
equate
the
process
of
committing
to
a
career
early
with
maturity
and
a
sense
of
purpose
and
direction
some
students
fear
that
committing
to
a
career
before
experiencing
a
wide
variety
of
college
courses
or
internships
may
cause
them
to
miss
out
on
the
chance
to
explore
new
interests
in
order
to
fully
understand
whether
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
beneficial
or
detrimental
it
is
important
to
look
at
current
trends
for
one
the
unemployed
youth
rate
has
been
steadily
declining
over
the
past
few
years
thanks
to
increased
focus
on
college
and
career
readiness
additionally
a
survey
found
that
of
adults
under
the
age
of
had
already
figured
out
the
specific
career
they
wanted
to
pursue
and
were
actively
seeking
the
knowledge
and
skills
to
make
it
happen
there
are
many
reasons
to
support
the
argument
that
students
should
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
one
such
reason
is
that
students
who
have
a
goal
in
mind
may
be
more
motivated
to
succeed
in
school
and
beyond
committing
to
a
career
early
provides
students
with
the
chance
to
have
more
meaningful
and
relevant
internships
and
job
experiences
that
would
not
be
possible
if
they
had
delayed
the
process
finally
committing
to
a
career
early
allows
students
to
explore
options
for
higher
education
such
as
early
college
programs
specialized
certifications
and
apprenticeships
many
successful
people
have
committed
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
and
found
great
success
one
notable
example
is
founder
of
at
just
he
was
already
a
millionaire
and
a
well known
figure
in
technology
similarly
year old
is
the
founder
of
and
at
years old
became
the
youngest
female
self made
billionaire
in
conclusion
while
it
can
be
intimidating
for
students
to
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
there
are
numerous
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
consider
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
answer
as
to
whether
students
should
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
but
it
can
be
a
rewarding
and
beneficial
process
for
those
who
are
phones
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
in
classrooms
as
students
look
for
ways
to
maximize
their
success
they
offer
access
to
an
array
of
educational
tools
that
can
be
beneficial
for
students
and
help
them
stay
organized
and
on
top
of
their
studies
however
while
many
students
report
positive
experiences
with
cellphones
in
the
classroom
there
are
also
drawbacks
that
should
be
considered
pros
of
in
education
phones
can
be
incredibly
useful
tools
for
learning
with
the
power
to
access
the
internet
students
can
supplement
the
learning
they
are
already
doing
in
the
classroom
additionally
many
educational
apps
are
designed
to
make
learning
fun
and
interactive
and
are
used
to
develop
key
skills
such
as
critical
thinking
as
well
as
testing
knowledge
phones
can
also
be
used
by
students
to
organize
their
studies
and
help
them
stay
on
track
cons
of
in
education
phones
can
be
distracting
if
not
used
responsibly
the
temptation
to
access
social
media
or
play
games
can
pull
students
away
from
their
studies
making
it
difficult
to
stay
focused
and
on
task
they
can
also
disrupt
the
classroom
environment
if
students
are
allowed
to
use
their
phones
while
other
students
are
learning
finally
the
temptation
to
cheat
is
greater
as
students
may
be
able
to
access
answers
online
during
a
test
that
they
may
not
otherwise
have
access
to
in
conclusion
cell
phones
have
the
potential
to
be
great
tools
for
learning
but
they
can
also
be
an
arduous
distraction
as
with
any
technology
it
is
up
to
the
teacher
student
and
parents
to
create
a
policy
that
respects
the
needs
of
the
student
while
ensuring
focus
and
respect
for
other
students
present
when
used
appropriately
cell
phones
can
be
a
helpful
addition
to
the
classroom
environment
praising
students
is
one
of
the
most
effective
methods
of
building
true
self esteem
true
self esteem
is
not
just
about
academic
achievement
but
it
is
about
feeling
valued
and
appreciated
regardless
of
results
when
children
are
praised
they
feel
acknowledged
and
appreciated
and
their
self worth
improves
it
should
be
based
on
effort
rather
than
the
outcome
and
can
help
students
learn
to
love
learning
for
its
own
sake
rather
than
just
for
a
reward
take
the
example
of
a
child
who
does
not
excel
in
math
for
this
student
a
simple
comment
from
his
teacher
about
his
effort
or
increased
participation
could
make
a
marked
difference
in
the
development
of
his
self esteem
hearing
a
positive
comment
that
acknowledges
his
effort
will
motivate
a
student
to
continue
trying
his
best
and
improving
rather
than
losing
confidence
and
feeling
frustrated
or
even
giving
up
on
the
other
hand
a
child
who
is
praised
based
solely
on
their
academic
performance
may
only
experience
temporary
boosts
in
self confidence
praising
students
solely
based
on
their
grades
reinforces
the
idea
that
their
value
is
based
solely
and
exclusively
on
their
grades
and
test
scores
this
sends
the
message
that
good
grades
are
the
only
proof
of
intelligence
and
ability
by
praising
students
for
their
hard
work
enthusiasm
creativity
and
willingness
to
take
risks
parents
and
teachers
can
help
students
to
develop
an
accurate
and
healthy
self esteem
praising
students
for
their
effort
and
character
can
help
students
to
internalize
the
message
that
their
worth
is
not
defined
by
their
grades
but
by
their
efforts
and
actions
this
will
create
the
foundation
for
a
strong
and
lasting
self esteem
singing
has
long
been
known
to
bring
joy
to
those
who
partake
in
it
for
many
people
it
is
a
form
of
expression
a
way
to
connect
with
their
emotions
and
feelings
and
a
way
to
feel
comforted
from
a
personal
standpoint
singing
brings
me
a
sense
of
calm
and
tranquility
especially
when
i
m
feeling
stressed
or
overwhelmed
my
ability
to
express
myself
through
song
has
also
helped
me
to
better
navigate
difficult
feelings
or
times
of
sadness
when
it
comes
to
the
research
it
appears
that
singing
is
a
great
way
to
increase
feelings
of
happiness
and
reduce
stress
according
to
a
study
published
in
the
journal
in
singing
was
found
to
reduce
anxiety
levels
and
regulation
of
the
hormonal
cortisol
which
is
the
stress
hormone
additionally
it
was
found
that
singing
can
increase
pleasant
emotions
and
feelings
while
decreasing
unpleasant
feelings
through
my
own
experiences
and
the
research
out
there
it
s
clear
that
singing
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
help
to
boost
one
s
mood
and
relieve
stress
whether
it
is
singing
alone
or
with
a
group
it
s
a
great
way
to
engage
in
some
self care
the
use
of
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
stay
in
contact
with
people
nowadays
it
is
easier
than
ever
before
for
friends
family
and
colleagues
to
connect
with
one
another
from
any
distance
with
the
aid
of
technology
businesses
and
schools
can
communicate
with
customers
and
students
quickly
and
efficiently
however
the
convenience
of
technology
has
also
had
its
downside
people
may
become
used
to
being
in
constant
contact
and
thus
may
not
develop
important
social
skills
that
can
only
be
acquired
through
face to face
interactions
also
as
technology
is
constantly
changing
some
may
struggle
to
keep
up
with
the
newest
advancements
overall
technology
has
had
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
how
people
interact
with
one
another
on
one
hand
it
has
allowed
us
to
connect
with
people
more
quickly
and
efficiently
than
ever
before
on
the
other
hand
it
may
also
be
detrimental
if
overused
or
not
used
with
the
proper
care
as
technology
continues
to
be
a
major
part
of
our
lives
it
is
important
to
remember
the
value
of
traditional
methods
of
communication
as
well
once
said
is
a
journey
not
a
destination
this
statement
speaks
to
the
idea
that
success
is
not
the
end
goal
but
rather
the
by product
of
the
journey
and
experience
are
essential
components
in
this
journey
helps
to
ingrain
the
skills
and
learning
necessary
to
become
successful
as
one
practices
and
starts
to
gain
experience
the
skills
and
knowledge
become
second
nature
and
can
serve
as
a
guide
in
the
journey
additionally
as
one
gains
more
experience
any
mistakes
seem
less
disastrous
and
can
provide
further
lessons
to
build
upon
practicing
and
having
more
experience
helps
to
give
the
necessary
tools
and
confidence
to
pursue
and
attain
success
ultimately
this
cumulative
effort
of
practice
and
experience
helps
to
empower
and
drive
one
s
journey
famously
said
determine
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
himself
was
living
proof
that
hard
work
pays
off
he
wrote
hundreds
of
letters
wrote
the
of
designed
and
built
his
home
studied
science
and
the
arts
and
served
as
the
third
of
the
states
all
of
these
successes
were
the
result
of
s
commitment
to
never
be
idle
and
to
always
be
doing
something
productive
from
s
life
and
his
famous
words
we
can
draw
two
important
lessons
about
the
benefits
of
hard
work
first
adequate
planning
can
help
you
achieve
your
goals
no
matter
how
ambitious
they
may
be
the
more
effort
you
put
into
something
the
better
the
outcome
will
be
once
said
i
m
a
great
believer
in
luck
and
i
find
the
harder
i
work
the
more
i
have
of
it
this
is
the
kind
of
attitude
we
should
have
towards
hard
work
it
not
only
gets
us
closer
to
achieving
our
goals
it
also
makes
us
more
fortunate
and
more
successful
in
the
process
in
recent
years
a
debate
around
whether
or
not
students
should
be
required
to
take
a
class
in
the
arts
has
arisen
on
the
one
hand
it
is
understandable
why
the
arts
should
be
mandatory
subjects
in
all
schools
the
arts
provide
enriching
opportunities
for
creativity
and
personal
expression
and
can
even
be
beneficial
to
enhance
academic
performance
in
other
areas
on
the
other
hand
every
person
has
different
capabilities
and
interests
and
should
be
given
the
option
to
choose
their
own
classes
it
is
important
that
the
opportunity
is
given
for
students
to
find
their
own
passions
and
that
is
best
encouraged
by
having
the
arts
as
electives
classes
in
the
arts
should
remain
electives
as
not
all
students
have
an
aptitude
in
the
arts
and
forcing
them
to
take
these
classes
could
lead
to
a
negative
experience
electives
allow
students
to
find
the
subjects
that
are
best suited
to
their
abilities
and
interests
while
still
having
the
opportunity
to
take
courses
in
the
arts
if
they
so
choose
consider
for
instance
students
who
are
far
more
motivated
by
sports
or
academics
and
would
be
much
better
served
immersing
in
the
areas
where
their
strengths
lie
than
to
force
them
to
partake
in
an
area
where
they
have
little
to
no
enthusiasm
or
aptitude
allowing
arts
as
electives
leave
more
room
for
those
who
take
a
genuine
interest
in
the
arts
to
develop
their
skills
and
participate
in
enriching
classes
students
who
are
truly
passionate
about
the
arts
should
be
recognized
and
have
the
opportunity
to
grow
their
skills
in
a
comfortable
learning
environment
elective
classes
also
provide
more
access
to
the
arts
and
expand
offerings
for
those
who
want
to
pursue
it
ultimately
classes
in
the
arts
should
remain
electives
as
having
the
arts
as
electives
allows
students
of
varying
capabilities
and
interests
find
their
passions
and
provides
an
enriching
environment
for
those
with
genuine
interests
in
the
arts
to
pursue
their
skills
in
this
way
student
s
intellectual
creative
and
personal
growth
can
be
furthered
and
encouraged
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
has
the
potential
to
be
highly
beneficial
to
the
environment
students
and
teachers
alike
can
use
the
additional
hours
to
learn
about
energy
conservation
and
other
sustainable
practices
these
practices
can
then
be
implemented
in
the
classroom
and
in
daily
life
outside
of
school
is
the
most
precious
resource
on
energy
conservation
can
reduce
the
consumption
of
natural
resources
and
help
protect
the
environment
through
energy
efficient
methods
such
as
turning
off
lights
and
electronics
when
not
in
use
using
laptops
instead
of
desktop
computers
and
replacing
incandescent
bulbs
with
students
and
teachers
can
reduce
the
overall
energy
consumption
of
the
school
the
saving
of
energy
not
only
incurs
monetary
benefits
but
can
also
help
reduce
air
pollution
and
global
warming
in
addition
to
energy
conservation
students
and
teachers
can
use
the
two
extra
hours
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
importance
of
preserving
natural
resources
and
making
the
world
better
by
introducing
activities
such
as
recycling
composting
and
upcycling
everyone
can
contribute
in
small
and
large
ways
to
decrease
waste
and
keep
the
planet
healthy
the
extra
two
hours
of
school
could
not
only
help
conserve
energy
and
resources
but
can
also
aid
in
creating
a
better
world
through
educating
students
in
energy saving
practices
they
can
then
take
the
lessons
they
have
learned
home
and
spread
the
conservation
mentality
to
others
thereby
setting
an
example
that
will
ultimately
result
in
a
more
positive
environment
for
generations
to
come
similarly
teaching
students
the
importance
of
preserving
natural
resources
will
help
foster
eco friendly
habits
that
will
have
a
lasting
impact
and
create
a
positive
environmental
legacy
overall
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
presents
numerous
benefits
to
saving
energy
and
resources
and
helps
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
with
continued
cooperation
from
students
and
teachers
it
is
clear
that
a
brighter
environmental
future
is
well
within
reach
s
statement
that
unless
you
try
to
do
something
beyond
what
you
have
already
mastered
you
will
never
grow
is
a
profound
reminder
of
the
importance
of
seeking
new
challenges
and
pushing
oneself
to
continually
grow
as
a
person
i
have
personally
experienced
the
effects
of
this
advice
throughout
my
academic
and
professional
career
on
several
occasions
i
have
boldly
taken
on
projects
that
have
initially
seemed
beyond
my
current
abilities
and
each
time
i
have
found
that
with
a
bit
of
hard
work
and
dedication
i
can
achieve
not
only
success
in
the
task
at
hand
but
also
gain
even
more
meaningful
insights
in
the
process
unfortunately
not
everyone
has
access
to
or
takes
the
opportunities
provided
to
them
to
explore
and
grow
particularly
those
in
less fortunate
socioeconomic
situations
given
the
daunting
lack
of
resources
available
to
many
individuals
the
idea
of
pushing
beyond
one
s
current
boundaries
can
seem
an
insurmountable
feat
it
is
therefore
essential
that
we
examine
the
conditions
of
the
disadvantaged
and
create
equitable
solutions
to
provide
them
with
the
same
opportunities
to
reach
their
full
potential
ways
in
which
this
can
be
done
include
increasing
access
to
education
and
job
training
as
well
as
offering
social
and
technical
support
to
low income
individuals
and
families
with
this
kind
of
support
we
can
work
to
ensure
that
everyone
has
the
ability
to
try
something
new
and
grow
beyond
their
current
limitations
making
a
career
decision
before
finishing
high
school
can
be
intimidating
to
many
young
adults
but
starting
early
can
also
have
significant
benefits
has
shown
that
early
career
commitment
boosts
students
confidence
levels
allowing
them
to
take
more
initiative
in
their
studies
and
working
to
reach
a
higher
level
of
academic
achievement
additionally
those
who
start
a
career
before
graduating
from
high
school
are
more
likely
to
have
successful
job
prospects
after
leaving
the
educational
system
early
commitment
allows
students
to
gain
valuable
experience
and
knowledge
as
well
as
build
relationships
that
can
be
beneficial
throughout
their
professional
career
however
it
is
understandable
that
some
people
believe
high
school
students
are
not
prepared
to
make
such
a
life changing
commitment
they
may
not
possess
the
mature
perspective
and
analytical
thinking
needed
to
make
smart
decisions
and
then
be
held
to
it
additionally
they
may
not
have
enough
experience
to
truly
appreciate
the
full
scope
of
the
career
they
are
committing
to
in
conclusion
for
some
high
school
students
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
be
an
advantageous
decision
it
gives
students
an
opportunity
to
gain
valuable
experience
build
relationships
and
allows
them
to
establish
themselves
in
the
professional
world
before
graduation
although
high
school
students
may
not
have
all
the
necessary
skills
and
experience
needed
to
make
such
a
commitment
they
should
be
given
the
support
and
resources
they
need
in
order
to
make
an
informed
decision
that
could
be
beneficial
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
introducing
a
new
menu
in
the
school
cafeteria
could
have
positive
and
negatives
effects
depending
on
the
type
of
food
offered
on
the
one
hand
it
would
provide
more
choice
for
students
who
need
to
follow
specific
dietary
requirements
and
may
have
been
limited
by
the
existing
range
of
options
on
the
other
hand
students
who
have
been
at
the
school
for
some
time
may
not
be
used
to
the
new
menu
and
could
find
it
difficult
to
adapt
to
the
changes
therefore
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
potential
effects
on
existing
students
both
with
diets
and
those
with
a
long
history
at
the
school
to
ensure
that
everyone
s
needs
are
taken
into
account
science
experiments
are
enjoyable
and
engaging
activities
that
are
suitable
for
people
of
all
ages
the
process
of
conducting
experiments
offers
a
unique
opportunity
to
explore
the
unknown
and
unlock
the
secrets
of
the
natural
world
in
this
essay
i
will
explore
three
ways
in
which
science
experiments
can
be
enjoyable
the
first
way
science
experiments
are
enjoyable
is
by
allowing
people
to
learn
in
an
interactive
manner
through
experimentation
one
can
learn
a
variety
of
new
concepts
and
skills
while
gaining
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
scientific
method
experiments
can
also
make
learning
enjoyable
by
providing
an
opportunity
to
problem solve
and
discover
new
ideas
such
as
when
designing
an
experiment
to
test
a
hypothesis
for
example
students
might
create
a
controlled
experiment
to
measure
the
impact
of
adding
fertilizer
on
the
growth
rate
of
plants
the
second
way
science
experiments
are
enjoyable
is
by
offering
an
opportunity
to
explore
the
creative
aspects
of
science
experimenting
allows
people
to
use
their
imagination
and
explore
innovative
solutions
to
scientific
problems
also
fosters
creativity
because
it
encourages
people
to
come
up
with
innovative
solutions
to
the
challenges
they
face
for
example
when
exploring
the
properties
of
a
new
material
one
might
experiment
with
different
combinations
of
components
to
discover
the
properties
that
most
effectively
make
it
useful
the
third
way
science
experiments
are
enjoyable
is
by
providing
an
entertaining
and
stimulating
experience
conducting
experiments
can
be
fun
exciting
and
exhilarating
as
people
work
to
discover
something
new
also
brings
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
pride
as
one
has
successfully
demonstrated
their
findings
and
come
to
a
conclusion
experiments
are
also
a
great
way
to
engage
with
others
as
many
people
enjoy
sharing
their
results
and
discussing
their
findings
with
each
other
for
example
a
family
might
have
fun
setting
up
different
experiments
and
then
compare
their
results
in
conclusion
there
are
numerous
ways
in
which
science
experiments
can
be
enjoyable
from
learning
interactively
to
exploring
the
creative
aspects
of
science
to
having
fun
and
easily
engaging
with
others
experiments
offer
a
great
opportunity
to
explore
the
mysterious
world
around
us
they
can
ignite
someone
s
curiosity
and
love
of
science
and
make
learning
enjoyable
students
today
are
under
unprecedented
pressure
both
academically
and
extracurricularly
on
top
of
having
to
juggle
their
studies
and
succeed
in
their
exams
many
of
them
are
required
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
in
order
to
appear
more
desirable
to
future
colleges
or
employers
this
only
adds
to
the
mountain
of
stress
they
already
experience
as
they
progress
through
their
academic
journey
making
the
demands
of
participating
in
these
activities
would
not
only
take
away
from
students
much needed
rest
and
relaxation
but
can
also
mean
that
they
are
unable
to
finish
their
school
assignments
or
study
in
a
timely
manner
at
the
same
time
many
of
these
students
may
need
to
work
part time
to
cover
their
living
expenses
which
can
further
pile
on
the
stress
and
consume
their
precious
free
time
with
all
these
factors
in
mind
it
should
be
left
up
to
the
students
and
their
families
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
it
is
only
fair
and
in
many
cases
much
more
beneficial
to
grant
the
students
and
their
families
the
freedom
to
make
their
own
decisions
after
all
this
generation
of
students
has
to
be
prepared
to
enter
the
world
after
graduation
and
they
should
not
be
expected
to
do
this
with
an
immense
amount
of
stress
bearing
down
on
their
shoulders
therefore
it
is
vital
that
students
and
their
families
should
be
given
the
freedom
to
make
their
own
decisions
when
it
comes
to
extracurricular
activities
it
is
clear
that
traditional
in person
educational
instruction
and
distance
learning
instruction
both
have
their
own
unique
pros
and
cons
instruction
offers
a
more
engaging
and
interactive
learning
experience
which
is
important
in
making
sure
that
students
have
a
thorough
and
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
material
while
distance
learning
can
be
more
convenient
for
students
since
they
can
learn
anywhere
with
an
internet
connection
additionally
distance
learning
provides
more
flexibility
and
can
be
beneficial
for
those
with
financial
or
mobility
restraints
on
the
other
hand
students
may
have
difficulty
staying
motivated
and
engaged
with
their
own
learning
when
taking
online
classes
some
may
not
receive
sufficient
assistance
and
guidance
from
the
instructors
or
have
difficulty
staying
organized
and
meeting
deadlines
instruction
also
allows
for
socialization
and
collaboration
with
classmates
which
can
be
an
important
part
of
the
learning
experience
given
the
current
educational
climate
distance
learning
has
become
a
popular
choice
for
learning
however
it
is
worth
considering
the
possible
implications
it
may
have
for
student
learning
and
development
learning
can
provide
a
number
of
advantages
but
it
may
come
with
its
own
set
of
challenges
as
well
students
and
their
families
should
be
mindful
and
consider
all
the
ramifications
of
distance
learning
before
making
a
decision
personally
i
believe
a
combination
of
distance
learning
and
in person
instruction
is
ideal
as
each
has
unique
benefits
that
can
contribute
to
a
student
s
long term
academic
success
first
impressions
are
very
important
as
they
shape
an
idea
of
who
someone
is
and
who
they
are
likely
to
be
in
the
future
i
have
experienced
this
firsthand
during
my
first
year
of
university
as
i
walked
into
my
first
class
i
was
met
with
skeptical
glares
and
glances
from
some
of
my
classmates
i
immediately
felt
out
of
place
and
my
discomfort
was
evident
in
my
interactions
with
them
as
time
went
on
my
classmates
started
to
warm
up
to
me
and
show
interest
in
getting
to
know
me
but
the
initial
impression
i
made
made
it
more
difficult
to
build
a
connection
with
them
if
i
had
made
a
more
positive
first
impression
i
strongly
believe
that
the
rest
of
the
semester
would
have
gone
much
smoother
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
incredibly
important
part
of
living
life
it
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
our
accomplishments
well being
and
the
way
we
interact
with
the
world
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
in
achieving
our
goals
solving
economic
issues
and
enjoying
day to day
life
of
all
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
us
to
stay
motivated
and
puts
us
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
to
pursue
our
ambitions
it
can
help
to
give
us
the
mental
strength
to
push
through
challenges
and
to
keep
going
even
when
things
get
hard
when
i
was
trying
to
complete
my
degree
it
was
my
positive
attitude
that
kept
me
going
and
got
me
through
the
difficult
times
a
positive
attitude
can
also
contribute
to
solving
economic
issues
it
can
encourage
us
to
take
risks
to
make
wise
investments
and
to
be
creative
in
our
problem
solving
my
own
experience
of
starting
a
new
business
highlighted
the
crucial
role
that
optimism
can
have
in
giving
us
the
courage
and
determination
to
tackle
the
difficulties
that
we
may
come
across
finally
having
a
positive
attitude
also
makes
our
day to day
life
more
enjoyable
it
enables
us
to
have
positive
relationships
with
others
and
to
make
the
most
of
our
day
i
have
personally
seen
how
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
has
greatly
improved
my
social
life
i
am
now
much
more
likely
to
take
risks
talk
to
new
people
and
accept
opportunities
to
conclude
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
in
achieving
goals
solving
economic
issues
and
living
life
to
the
fullest
it
can
give
us
the
motivation
to
push
forwards
and
the
courage
to
take
risks
i
believe
that
by
embracing
a
positive
attitude
we
can
all
fully
enjoy
the
life
that
we
lead
in
today
s
society
there
is
much
debate
over
whether
it
is
better
to
be
constantly
active
or
if
inactivity
can
also
be
useful
when
it
comes
to
staying
on
track
in
school
working
hard
like
a
parent
and
getting
things
done
like
a
soccer
player
staying
active
is
a
great
way
to
ensure
success
by
remaining
active
one
can
stay
focused
be
productive
and
be
motivated all
of
which
are
important
components
of
success
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
steps
that
require
inactivity
in
order
to
be
effective
taking
the
time
to
rest
and
reflect
is
just
as
important
as
actively
working
towards
goals
taking
restorative
breaks
and
allowing
yourself
to
take
a
break
will
help
maintain
your
mental
and
physical
health
which
can
give
you
the
energy
and
motivation
you
need
to
succeed
in
conclusion
i
believe
that
both
being
active
and
occasionally
allowing
yourself
to
slow
down
have
their
place
when
it
comes
to
accomplishing
more
staying
active
is
important
for
staying
focused
and
motivated
while
taking
breaks
is
important
for
maintaining
your
health
and
energy
both
of
these
strategies
used
in
balance
can
help
you
reach
your
goals
after
researching
different
career
opportunities
i
identified
a
particular
career
of
interest
to
me
video
game
designer
i
then
investigated
possible
ways
to
learn
more
about
this
career
such
as
attending
events
taking
classes
and
participating
in
trips
that
are
available
i
also
spoke
to
someone
who
currently
has
the
job
to
gain
more
insight
into
the
career
and
to
how
i
could
go
about
preparing
for
it
i
analyzed
the
skills
i
learned
in
high
school
and
considered
how
they
could
help
me
in
my
chosen
career
path
ultimately
i
determined
the
dedication
and
passion
i
would
need
to
have
to
succeed
in
this
field
working
with
local
companies
and
organizations
to
complete
community
projects
can
be
a
beneficial
experience
for
students
it
can
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
gain
valuable
real world
experience
build
their
resume
and
network
with
members
of
their
local
community
such
work
typically
involves
tasks
like
conducting
research
problem
solving
implementing
solutions
working
with
stakeholders
writing
reports
and
presenting
about
their
findings
however
working
with
local
partners
can
also
come
with
potential
risks
it
is
important
that
students
ensure
that
they
are
aware
of
any
safety
risks
and
protocol
that
comes
along
with
the
project
there
can
also
be
a
risk
of
miscommunication
or
discrepancies
between
the
student
and
local
partner
furthermore
it
is
important
to
understand
that
working
locally
can
involve
long term
commitments
which
may
affect
the
student
s
ability
to
manage
their
personal
and
academic
responsibilities
in
addition
many
students
find
working
on
local
projects
opens
up
the
possibility
to
create
long term
solutions
to
problems
in
their
community
this
not
only
benefits
the
student
personally
but
it
can
often
lead
to
broader
positive
effects
people
may
be
different
from
one
another
in
a
variety
of
ways
such
as
race
gender
socio economic
background
and
values
although
these
differences
can
often
feel
like
a
source
of
conflict
it
is
important
that
all
of
us
strive
for
happiness
regardless
of
our
differences
take
for
example
the
story
of
in
in
she
was
a
child
rights
activist
who
rose
to
fame
after
publicly
standing
up
against
the
s
ban
on
girls
education
in
spite
of
her
differences
was
undeterred
in
her
pursuit
of
happiness
showing
us
that
our
differences
should
not
keep
us
from
achieving
our
goals
another
example
is
native
woman
she
faced
many
challenges
within
her
home
country
s
struggle
for
autonomy
despite
this
she
continues
to
be
committed
to
the
hawaiian
struggle
and
to
the
pursuit
of
her
own
happiness
she
serves
as
an
example
that
differences
can
be
embraced
and
used
to
drive
us
to
strive
for
our
goals
in
the
end
our
differences
are
what
shape
us
and
provide
us
with
unique
experiences
yet
that
doesn
t
mean
we
should
limit
ourselves
from
striving
for
happiness
we
must
not
let
our
differences
be
an
obstacle
to
finding
contentment
in
life
through
our
understanding
of
others
we
can
recognize
that
our
differences
are
just
one
part
of
who
we
are
and
ultimately
we
can
learn
to
reach
mutual
understanding
and
work
together
to
achieve
our
goals
good
morning
fellow
students
i
am
here
today
to
talk
about
the
importance
of
community
service
of
us
are
volunteering
our
time
and
energy
to
make
our
school
a
better
place
whether
it
s
assisting
with
someone
s
homework
cleaning
up
our
classrooms
and
school
grounds
or
talking
to
our
parents
about
community
service
it
s
all
making
a
difference
our
collective
efforts
are
having
a
direct
and
positive
impact
on
our
learning
environment
beyond
the
school
building
there
are
endless
opportunities
to
offer
our
time
and
energy
to
the
wider
community
through
volunteering
not
only
does
community
service
benefit
our
community
but
it
also
gives
us
the
chance
to
gain
new
skills
build
relationships
and
have
a
sense
of
purpose
by
taking
part
in
community
service
activities
we
are
expanding
our
empathy
and
understanding
of
the
broader
world
we
re
not
just
making
our
town
a
better
place
to
live
we
re
making
it
a
better
place
to
learn
i
ask
each
and
every
one
of
you
to
think
about
how
you
can
become
a
part
of
this
great
movement
by
making
time
and
effort
to
lend
a
helping
hand
together
we
can
make
a
real
difference
you
inactivity
can
be
beneficial
in
more
ways
than
one
is
essential
for
our
bodies
to
recover
from
daily
activities
and
can
help
us
stay
ahead
of
our
physical
and
mental
health
taking
a
break
from
school
or
work
and
catching
up
on
our
favorite
tv
shows
can
be
an
excellent
way
to
stimulate
our
minds
and
relax
our
bodies
hiring
household
assistants
like
a
butler
or
maid
can
help
to
further
free
up
time
and
energy
making
more
time
to
be
inactive
in
small
doses
inactivity
can
be
beneficial
for
productivity
purposes
for
example
taking
breaks
throughout
the
day
to
relax
and
recharge
can
help
us
to
focus
better
on
tasks
that
require
more
energy
taking
some
time
for
self care
can
reward
us
with
more
mental
clarity
and
improved
productivity
i
experienced
the
benefits
of
inactivity
firsthand
after
a
particularly
long
work
day
i
took
a
few
hours
to
watch
some
tv
and
relax
before
tackling
a
big
project
i
had
been
avoiding
it
turns
out
the
break
was
just
what
i
needed
to
refresh
and
recharge
my
mind
and
i
was
able
to
complete
the
project
with
relative
ease
for
those
with
limited
time
or
energy
to
be
inactive
hiring
a
butler
or
other
household
assistant
might
be
the
way
to
go
they
can
free
up
more
time
to
relax
or
prioritize
and
complete
tasks
so
that
downtime
can
be
taken
with
peace
of
mind
these
extra
hands
can
also
help
get
through
daily
errands
cleaning
and
organizing
so
that
less
valuable
time
is
devoted
to
mundane
activities
the
advancement
of
technology
has
had
an
immense
impact
on
the
world
that
we
live
in
from
a
communication
perspective
the
development
of
mobile
phones
computers
and
the
internet
have
allowed
us
to
connect
with
people
from
all
over
the
world
in
the
realm
of
commerce
technology
has
enabled
businesses
to
operate
more
efficiently
providing
greater
opportunities
for
entrepreneurs
and
consumers
alike
finally
technology
has
advanced
entertainment
options
whether
it
be
streaming
video
video
games
or
virtual
reality
of
course
technology
has
its
downsides
as
well
people
have
grown
increasingly
dependent
on
technology
compromising
personal
interactions
social
skills
and
possibly
even
contributing
to
mental
health
issues
additionally
technology
has
enabled
increased
surveillance
and
raised
concerns
about
privacy
nevertheless
it
s
clear
that
technology
has
significantly
changed
the
way
we
live
in
the
modern
world
the
increase
in
advances
in
technology
has
revolutionized
learning
making
it
possible
for
students
to
attend
classes
from
home
this
offers
a
number
of
advantages
allowing
students
greater
flexibility
enabling
them
to
manage
classes
and
work
commitments
efficiently
furthermore
the
fact
that
they
can
still
be
in
touch
with
their
teachers
and
peers
makes
this
a
valuable
experience
however
this
privilege
also
presents
certain
drawbacks
such
as
a
lack
of
face to face
interaction
between
teachers
and
students
as
well
as
between
students
themselves
being
isolated
from
the
classroom
environment
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
develop
their
communication
skills
moreover
in
an
era
when
screens
are
ubiquitous
there
is
an
increased
potential
for
students
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
and
get
distracted
with
activities
such
as
social
media
online
gaming
or
shopping
thus
making
it
difficult
for
them
to
concentrate
and
learn
attending
classes
from
home
has
the
potential
to
be
a
rewarding
experience
if
students
use
it
prudently
it
is
important
to
create
a
good
learning
environment
at
home
where
students
can
focus
and
absorb
the
material
while
still
developing
their
social
skills
ultimately
the
success
of
this
privilege
relies
on
students
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
further
their
learning
intergenerational
programs
that
create
an
atmosphere
of
collaboration
between
older
and
younger
students
provide
a
platform
for
learning
and
growth
that
can
be
beneficial
on
many
levels
working
together
in
an
activity
that
focuses
on
shared
goals
and
has
a
positive
outcome
can
help
to
form
groups
of
peers
who
can
then
support
each
other
in
their
academic
and
personal
endeavors
for
the
younger
students
participation
in
such
a
program
can
provide
invaluable
insights
into
how
to
perform
better
academically
having
the
advice
and
guidance
of
an
older
individual
can
help
them
to
focus
on
forming
better
study
habits
developing
better
organizational
skills
and
using
more
effective
strategies
for
learning
additionally
the
older
students
will
be
able
to
serve
as
positive
role
models
that
can
help
the
younger
students
to
develop
the
physical
social
and
intellectual
skills
they
need
to
reach
their
goals
at
the
same
time
the
older
students
involved
in
such
a
program
will
gain
significant
advantages
not
only
will
they
be
able
to
pass
down
knowledge
and
experience
but
the
younger
students
enthusiasm
and
eagerness
for
learning
will
reduce
the
boredom
of
teaching
in
addition
the
interactions
between
the
two
age
groups
will
foster
community
involvement
by
encouraging
dialogue
about
important
local
issues
in
sum
an
intergenerational
program
that
brings
together
older
and
younger
students
is
a
valuable
learning
opportunity
that
can
benefit
individuals
groups
and
the
community
as
a
whole
by
considering
factors
such
as
improved
grades
increased
trust
and
camaraderie
among
peers

working
together

tackle
local
issues
the
potential
advantages
to
be
gained

such
a
program

making
a
career
in
medicine
is
often
a
daunting
choice
to
consider
there
are
many
hospitals
and
specialized
medical
centers
that
offer
a
variety
of
services
and
understanding
the
kind
of
care
they
provide
can
help
to
inform
your
decision
becoming
a
doctor
is
a
lengthy
process
and
there
are
important
pros
and
cons
to
consider
before
making
any
final
decision
the
best
way
to
get
a
good
understanding
of
the
medical
field
is
to
visit
a
hospital
and
observe
the
daily
operations
seeing
the
methods
that
doctors
use
to
take
care
of
their
patients
can
provide
insight
into
what
a
career
in
medicine
entails
additionally
learning
more
about
surgery
and
the
tools
used
can
help
to
further

the
challenges
and
rewards
of
a
career
in

can
help
you
determine
if
it
is
the
right
path
for
you
and
how
you
can
make
a
difference
in
treating
the
ill
famously
said
that
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
is
a
profound
statement
that
speaks
to
the
importance
of
not
letting
failure
stand
in
the
way
of
achieving
your
ultimate
success
failure
is
a
natural
part
of
life
no
one
accomplishes
their
goals
with
initial
success
alone
it
is
by
learning
from
our
mistakes
that
we
can
become
better
and
progress
towards
success
in
particular
it
is
the
courage
to
persist
through
the
failures
that
will
ultimately
drive
lasting
success
serves
as
a
powerful
example
of
this
idea
as
his
tenacity
through
his
failures
enabled
him
to
ultimately
become
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
in
history
he
was
able
to
persist
through
difficult
times
of
failure
and
ultimately
achieved
great
success
because
of
his
determination
and
courage
to
continue
in
short
failures
do
not
necessarily
indicate
a
lack
of
success
rather
they
should
be
viewed
as
an
important
stepping
stone
on
the
way
to
success
through
the
courage
to
not
give
up
in
the
face
of
failures
success
can
be
achieved
the
increased
amount
of
school
hours
could
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
students
attendance
grades
and
educational
life
on
one
hand
having
additional
time
spent
in
school
would
give
students
more
time
to
understand
the
material
and
complete
their
work
leading
to
improved
grades
furthermore
longer
hours
may
discourage
them
from
skipping
school
leading
to
higher
attendance
records
on
the
other
hand
lack
of
proper
resources
such
as
textbooks
additional
staff
and
educational
materials
may
lead
to
lower
quality
of
education
and
limit
students
ability
to
truly
benefit
from
the
additional
school
hours
additionally
this
can
also
cause
students
to
become
overwhelmed
and
tired
from
longer
days
leading
to
low
morale
and
reduced
motivation
resulting
in
decreased
attendance
and
poorer
grades
therefore
it
is
essential
to
ensure
that
adequate
resources
and
support
are
available
to
students
before
extending
their
school
day
failure
is
a
part
of
life
and
accepting
and
understanding
the
role
it
plays
is
key
to
succeeding
and
maintaining
enthusiasm
many
think
of
failure
as
a
negative
and
defeating
experience
but
it
is
often
a
stepping
stone
to
success
knowing
that
failure
is
a
part
of
the
process
can
help
us
stay
motivated
and
not
give
up
for
example
if
you
are
learning
a
new
skill
you
may
make
some
mistakes
in
the
beginning
and
have
difficulty
mastering
the
skill
rather
than
becoming
overly
critical
and
giving
up
accepting
your
mistakes
as
part
of
the
learning
process
can
help
you
see
the
progress
you
are
making
over
time
this
can
help
you
develop
the
skill
and
gain
confidence
in
it
another
way
that
failure
can
play
an
important
role
in
succeeding
is
by
allowing
us
to
grow
and
learn
when
we
fail
we
can
reflect
on
the
things
that
didn
t
work
identify
ways
in
which
we
can
improve
and
then
use
this
knowledge
to
perform
better
next
time
in
this
way
failure
can
be
an
opportunity
to
gain
new
insights
and
see
different
perspectives
finally
by
understanding
that
failure
is
a
part
of
the
process
it
can
take
away
the
fear
of
taking
risks
and
allow
us
to
pursue
our
goals
with
enthusiasm
when
we
accept
that
failure
is
an
integral
part
of
the
journey
to
success
it
can
help
us
try
new
things
and
take
on
more
challenges
without
fear
of
repercussion
in
conclusion
understanding
the
role
failure
plays
in
success
is
an
important
part
of
succeeding
and
maintaining
enthusiasm
rather
than
viewing
failure
as
a
negative
experience
we
should
view
it
as
an
opportunity
for
growth
and
learning
that
can
help
us
make
progress
and
achieve
our
goals
higher
education
experts
have
debated
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
extending
school
days
for
decades
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
could
provide
students
with
more
time
to
complete
courses
and
allow
teachers
to
cover
more
material
on
the
other
hand
students
may
become
overwhelmed
with
increased
workload
and
lengthened
days
could
increase
stress
levels
a
prominent
argument
for
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
is
that
it
could
provide
students
with
more
diverse
learning
opportunities
this
could
include
additional
courses
clubs
arts
education
and
tutoring
students
may
also
benefit
from
having
more
time
to
build
relationships
with
peers
in
a
supervised
environment
on
the
other
hand
the
impact
of
adding
one
and
a
half
hours
to
the
school
day
could
be
varied
and
unpredictable
teachers
may
become
overburdened
with
increased
class
sizes
or
with
the
need
to
plan
additional
courses
students
may
also
struggle
to
keep
up
with
more
demanding
academic
requirements
resulting
in
a
decline
in
concentration
and
motivation
ultimately
before
extending
the
school
day
it
is
important
to
consider
the
impact
that
it
will
have
on
students
and
teachers
careful
research
and
planning
should
be
conducted
to
ensure
that
any
potential
benefits
outweigh
the
drawbacks
dear
i
am
writing
to
express
my
concern
over
the
school
s
policy
of
only
allowing
range
students
on
teams
and
other
activities
i
am
proposing
that
the
policy
should
be
changed
to
range
and
i
have
two
reasons
to
support
this
argument
firstly
by
only
allowing
range
students
the
school
is
inadvertently
preventing
many
range
students
from
participating
in
activities
that
could
prove
beneficial
to
their
mental
and
physical
wellbeing
activities
such
as
sports
and
other
team based
events
can
provide
students
with
a
great
sense
of
success
and
accomplishment
and
can
also
act
as
a
valuable
form
of
stress
relief
of
course
range
students
can
benefit
from
these
activities
too
but
by
limiting
participation
to
those
students
the
school
is
denying
range
students
an
opportunity
to
experience
the
positive
effects
of
sports
and
team based
activities
secondly
allowing
range
students
to
participate
in
teams
and
other
activities
could
help
to
break
down
stigmas
and
encourage
greater
inclusivity
throughout
the
school
the
current
policy
may
suggest
to
range
students
that
they
are
not
good
enough
to
participate
in
certain
activities
and
this
can
negatively
affect
their
sense
of
self worth
and
belonging
by
changing
the
policy
to
allow
all
students
to
participate
regardless
of
their
grades
it
could
positively
impact
the
school
environment
and
promote
a
sense
of
social
solidarity
amongst
students
in
conclusion
i
am
advocating
for
the
school
to
change
its
policy
to
a
range
for
teams
and
other
activities
this
will
ensure
that
all
students
regardless
of
grades
are
able
to
experience
the
benefits
of
teamwork
and
physical
activity
and
will
also
help
to
create
a
more
inclusive
environment
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
sincerely
your
name
pairing
up
older
and
younger
students
can
be
an
incredibly
beneficial
arrangement
by
forming
connections
across
generations
both
parties
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
each
other
older
students
have
a
lot
of
helpful
advice
to
share
about
the
challenges
and
expectations
of
high
school
they
can
provide
guidance
about
study
habits
time
management
and
cultivating
a
healthy
work life
balance
younger
students
in
turn
can
offer
a
fresh
perspective
they
can
be
particularly
useful
for
providing
insights
into
new
technologies
and
trends
that
may
be
useful
for
their
older
peers
management
is
another
area
where
these
partnerships
can
be
especially
helpful
through
shared
conversations
and
mutual
support
older
and
younger
students
can
create
a
safe
environment
in
which
to
discuss
anxieties
and
stressors
and
make
healthy
plans
for
dealing
with
them
s
statement
that
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
not
in
setting
our
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
but
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
mark
is
a
poignant
reminder
of
how
easy
it
is
to
become
complacent
in
settling
for
mediocrity
rather
than
aiming
big
and
taking
risks
in
pursuit
of
success
a
great
example
of
this
is
the
story
of
the
founder
of
and
rather
than
being
content
to
run
a
successful
business
took
a
risk
that
many
people
thought
was
too
ambitious
and
started
challenging
the
status
quo
of
both
the
auto
industry
and
space
exploration
he
had
a
very
lofty
goal
aiming
to
completely
revolutionize
two
industries
that
had
been
stagnant
and
going
against
those
who
advised
him
to
take
a
less
aggressive
stance
in
the
end
he
achieved
great
successes
becoming
one
of
the
most
influential
figures
of
the
modern
era
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
ambition
and
risk
that
was
referring
to not
settling
for
anything
less
than
one
s
greatest
potential
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
years
can
be
advantageous
in
many
ways
the
accelerated
pace
of
learning
can
be
beneficial
to
highly
motivated
students
who
may
already
possess
a
solid
understanding
of
course
material
and
find
a
regular paced
education
too
slow
such
students
may
also
benefit
from
not
having
to
repeat
any
courses
saving
them
time
and
money
in
the
long
run
furthermore
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
allows
students
to
start
college
early
and
complete
their
degree
in
less
time
however
there
are
several
drawbacks
to
finishing
high
school
in
three
years
taking
extra
classes
can
be
a
huge
strain
on
students
time
and
energy
additionally
accelerated
courses
may
not
allow
for
adequate
time
to
process
or
master
material
leaving
students
without
a
firm
foundation
in
more
advanced
subjects
more
technical
classes
such
as
science
and
math
may
require
a
slower
approach
in
order
for
students
to
adequately
grasp
the
concepts
allowing
for
increased
retention
and
comprehension
lastly
an
accelerated
plan
may
not
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
pursue
extra curricular
activities
such
as
sports
or
joining
a
club
is
defined
as
having
a
positive
opinion
of
oneself
and
achievement
as
reaching
a
goal
or
standard
in
the
essay
the
writer
explains
how
elements
of
self esteem
achievement
confidence
trust
learning
and
work
are
integral
to
success
for
instance
to
gain
the
trust
of
others
a
person
needs
to
demonstrate
confidence
and
dependability
in
their
work
similarly
a
sense
of
personal
fulfillment
and
self esteem
is
heightened
when
one
achieves
success
in
learning
experiences
to
illustrate
this
the
author
provides
an
example
of
how
engaging
in
meaningful
work
and
activities
can
lead
to
academic
and
career
success
another
example
the
author
gives
is
how
hard
work
and
dedication
can
lead
to
professional
achievements
and
a
sense
of
inner
worth
through
these
examples
the
essay
expresses
the
importance
of
the
concepts
of
self esteem
achievement
confidence
trust
learning
and
work
in
enabling
success
over
the
past
few
years
i
have
participated
in
a
variety
of
extracurricular
activities
ranging
from
choir
to
soccer
and
student
council
through
my
experiences
i
have
come
to
realize
that
extracurricular
activities
have
a
variety
of
positive
benefits
for
teenagers
extracurricular
activities
can
help
teenagers
develop
skills
that
are
difficult
to
learn
in
a
school
setting
for
example
when
i
joined
the
student
council
in
high
school
i
was
able
to
learn
how
to
work
on
a
team
more
effectively
and
how
to
stay
organized
during
a
project
additionally
my
involvement
in
extracurricular
activities
has
helped
me
learn
important
communication
skills
such
as
public
speaking
writing
simple
and
effective
emails
and
networking
has
also
shown
that
extracurricular
activities
have
a
positive
impact
not
only
on
academic
performance
but
on
students
overall
success
extracurricular
activities
promote
teamwork
build
self confidence
and
help
teenagers
stay
focused
on
their
studies
a
study
by
showed
that
students
who
take
part
in
extracurricular
activities
are
more
likely
to
have
a
of
or
higher
than
those
who
do
not
participate
overall
i
believe
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
is
beneficial
for
teenagers
not
only
do
they
give
teenagers
an
opportunity
to
learn
important
skills
they
also
promote
academic
success
and
help
develop
an
overall
sense
of
confidence
was
a
quintessential
example
of
a
lifelong
learner
determined
to
never
be
idle
from
studying
law
to
becoming
a
prominent
political
leader
his
achievements
have
served
as
an
inspiration
to
generations
of
americans
his
dedication
to
learning
and
his
unwavering
commitment
to
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
serves
as
an
example
to
anyone
striving
to
make
the
most
of
their
potential
his
life
story
also
illustrates
the
power
of
never
being
idle by
remaining
consistent
in
his
efforts
was
able
to
create
extraordinary
outcomes
his
legacy
is
a
reminder
of
the
importance
of
one
s
commitment
to
never
be
idle
and
how
even
the
smallest
actions
can
add
up
to
truly
meaningful
results
self reliance
is
an
important
attribute
to
possess
in
order
to
be
successful
and
lead
a
happy
fulfilling
life
it
involves
having
the
common
sense
to
solve
a
problem
without
expecting
someone
else
to
take
the
lead
and
responsibility
experience
matters
as
well
since
having
prior
knowledge
and
learning
from
mistakes
helps
one
make
sound
judgements
and
take
meaningful
actions
also
plays
a
role
in
becoming
self reliant
it
is
important
to
be
able
to
make
decisions
for
yourself
and
not
always
have
to
rely
on
somebody
else
s
opinion
however
there
is
an
argument
against
relying
too
much
on
oneself
for
instances
it
can
lead
to
a
lack
of
collaboration
in
which
people
become
too
isolated
and
do
n t
learn
from
the
ideas
of
others
taking
advice
from
someone
who
is
more
experienced
in
a
field
and
learning
from
them
can
be
beneficial
and
even
highlight
areas
where
one
was
ignorant
in
conclusion
self reliance
is
a
necessary
trait
for
leading
a
productive
life
but
it
should
be
balanced
with
taking
constructive
advice
from
others
therefore
it
is
important
to
assess
each
situation
and
use
wisdom
in
order
to
find
the
right
amount
of
self reliance
to
suit
one
s
needs
it
is
often
said
that
no
act
of
kindness
no
matter
how
small
is
ever
wasted
at
first
this
might
seem
like
a
trite
old
proverb
with
no
real
meaning
but
when
one
considers
the
myriad
of
ways
in
which
a
simple
act
of
kindness
can
impact
a
person
s
life
the
importance
of
such
an
act
becomes
clear
take
the
example
of
a
student
who
is
having
a
difficult
time
in
completing
a
challenging
assignment
in
school
perhaps
they
are
struggling
to
find
the
motivation
to
even
begin
the
task
let
alone
complete
it
something
as
small
as
encouraging
words
from
a
teacher
or
classmate
or
even
from
a
stranger
about
their
potential
to
succeed
can
be
incredibly
positive
and
motivating
in
pushing
them
forward
this
small
act
of
kindness
has
the
potential
to
encourage
perseverance
and
even
ignite
their
passion
to
succeed
numerous
studies
have
found
that
simple
acts
of
social
kindness
and
connection
such
as
eye
contact
or
a
simple
hello
when
passing
someone
on
the
street
have
a
powerful
effect
on
both
the
giver
and
the
receiver
it
can
bring
about
an
immediate
feeling
of
warmth
and
connection
and
can
even
spark
more
meaningful
relationships
in
the
future
people
who
feel
seen
and
acknowledged
are
often
more
motivated
to
contribute
positive
value
to
their
communities
which
in
turn
creates
a
wider
ripple
effect
of
positivity
ultimately
small
acts
of
kindness
can
open
us
up
to
an
entirely
new
world
that
is
full
of
potential
it
starts
with
one
small
gesture
once
we
recognize
the
power
of
a
kind
word
or
simple
smile
we
can
begin
to
create
a
chain
reaction
of
positive
energy
that
radiates
across
our
lives
and
the
lives
of
those
around
us
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
for
success
in
life
when
we
approach
situations
with
a
positive
attitude
our
minds
become
open
and
creative
allowing
us
to
see
all
of
the
potential
opportunities
that
await
us
not
only
does
having
a
positive
attitude
enable
us
to
see
these
opportunities
but
it
also
gives
us
the
motivation
and
confidence
to
take
advantage
of
them
to
illustrate
this
consider
the
example
of
applying
for
a
job
when
we
have
an
optimistic
attitude
about
the
process
we
feel
more
positive
about
the
interview
and
our
chances
of
landing
the
role
we
appear
more
professional
and
confident
to
the
interviewer
thereby
increasing
our
chances
of
success
on
the
other
hand
if
we
take
on
a
pessimistic
attitude
and
focus
on
scenarios
where
we
may
fail
we
become
more
apprehensive
and
inhibited
about
the
whole
process
killing
our
chances
of
success
even
before
we
ve
started
when
studying
for
an
exam
having
a
positive
attitude
enables
us
to
stay
focused
on
the
task
and
to
believe
in
our
ability
to
remember
the
material
the
power
of
having
a
positive
attitude
goes
beyond
just
making
us
feel
better
in
the
short term
when
we
have
a
positive
outlook
our
brains
become
more
oriented
towards
problem solving
creative
solutions
and
success
in
essence
a
positive
attitude
is
a
differentiator
for
success
in
life
it
is
therefore
vital
for
us
to
maintain
an
optimistic
and
motivated
outlook
if
we
want
to
make
the
most
out
of
our
life
endeavors
homework
clubs
offer
a
valuable
resource
to
students
and
teachers
alike
for
students
having
access
to
dedicated
time
and
support
to
tackle
challenging
homework
can
result
in
improved
understanding
of
concepts
and
improved
in class
performance
for
teachers
a
homework
club
provides
a
platform
to
provide
extra
support
to
students
as
well
as
monitor
student
progress
allowing
them
to
identify
and
address
any
areas
of
difficulty
additionally
students
who
participate
in
these
clubs
can
benefit
from
increased
motivation
and
a
feeling
of
being
part
of
a
supportive
team
clubs
thus
represent
a
viable
and
potentially
beneficial
solution
to
meet
the
needs
of
both
students
and
teachers
when
it
comes
to
completing
projects
working
in
a
group
can
be
extremely
helpful
working
collaboratively
can
maximize
efficiency
because
team
members
can
use
their
different
strengths
and
skills
to
complete
their
respective
tasks
more
quickly
for
instance
if
one
person
is
particularly
skilled
at
design
while
another
is
better
at
coding
then
they
can
get
the
project
done
faster
when
they
work
together
working
in
a
group
also
offers
the
benefit
of
sharing
knowledge
team
members
can
consult
each
other
for
advice
or
comment
on
each
other
s
ideas
this
is
beneficial
because
group
members
can
learn
from
each
other
in
a
way
that
is
not
possible
if
you
work
alone
finally
working
in
a
group
is
beneficial
for
developing
better
relationships
within
a
class
members
must
work
together
in
order
to
achieve
a
common
goal
which
can
foster
healthy
communication
and
collaboration
moreover
working
in
a
group
is
a
great
opportunity
to
learn
about
working
with
different
types
of
people
which
can
help
develop
communication
cooperation
and
problem solving
skills
making
a
career
decision
at
a
young
age
can
be
a
major
life
choice
that
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
the
positive
side
young
people
who
decide
to
pursue
a
specific
career
early
on
benefit
from
the
ability
to
take
specialized
courses
that
are
available
in
high
school
and
college
as
well
as
having
more
time
to
build
experience
and
skills
in
the
field
they
are
interested
in
additionally
pursuing
a
career
at
an
early
age
can
allow
a
young
person
to
save
up
money
and
gain
financial
stability
sooner
easing
the
burden
of
tuition
and
other
costs
down
the
road
on
the
other
hand
making
a
career
choice
at
a
young
age
also
carries
a
certain
level
of
risk
if
the
choice
is
incorrect
it
can
lead
to
stress
and
frustration
as
the
individual
s
educational
path
is
limited
additionally
making
too
early
of
a
career
decision
can
limit
a
young
person
s
view
of
future
possibilities
and
keep
them
from
exploring
options
they
may
have
later
wished
they
had
considered
it
is
also
not
guaranteed
that
the
chosen
career
will
lead
to
future
successes
even
if
the
initial
decision
was
a
good
one
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
individual
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
pursue
a
career
at
an
early
age
and
there
are
both
potential
risks
and
benefits
to
doing
so
although
taking
the
time
to
explore
different
options
and
find
the
best
fit
is
always
encouraged
making
a
career
decision
early
can
be
beneficial
for
some
as
long
as
the
decision
is
well researched
and
the
risks
and
benefits
are
taken
into
consideration
young
people
have
the
opportunity
to
make
an
informed
decision
that
can
lead
to
future
success
providing
students
with
a
more
balanced
school
menu
could
have
a
significant
positive
impact
on
overall
health
and
longevity
a
diet
which
focuses
on
the
right
balance
of
proteins
carbohydrates
and
fats
can
give
students
more
energy
better
concentration
improved
bone
and
muscle
strength
and
help
control
stress
levels
for
growing
students
a
balanced
diet
can
help
promote
healthy
development
both
physically
and
mentally
potentially
leading
to
a
healthier
life
in
adulthood
with
the
prevalence
of
diabetes
and
obesity
now
affecting
children
as
young
as
primary
school
age
providing
a
more
balanced
school
menu
could
help
in
promoting
healthy
eating
habits
which
could
stay
with
each
student
well
into
adulthood
ultimately
balanced
school
menus
can
serve
as
an
essential
first
step
to
developing
healthy
habits
that
can
improve
students
health
and
contribute
to
a
longer
life
the
enjoyment
of
educational
activities
is
often
rooted
in
the
process
of
learning
itself
learning
new
things
is
an
inherently
rewarding
experience
as
our
brains
are
biologically
wired
to
respond
positively
to
new
and
challenging
experiences
additionally
spending
time
with
friends
and
peers
can
be
an
integral
part
of
nurturing
and
expanding
on
our
knowledge
being
able
to
share
new
information
and
bounce
ideas
off
each
other
can
be
invaluable
finally
mistakes
and
failures
are
a
normal
part
of
the
learning
process
and
instead
of
looking
at
them
as
negative
experiences
they
can
be
seen
as
invaluable
opportunities
for
personal
growth
and
exploration
in
conclusion
the
enjoyment
of
educational
activities
can
come
from
many
different
sources
including
learning
new
things
spending
time
with
friends
and
learning
from
mistakes
engineering
a
career
is
a
complex
undertaking
and
it
is
far
too
much
to
expect
that
a
high
school
freshman
has
the
experience
or
skills
to
make
a
sound
decision
although
teens
may
seemingly
have
a
handle
on
who
they
are
and
where
they
are
headed
the
reality
is
that
they
are
still
too
young
and
immature
to
meaningfully
assess
their
strengths
and
interests
this
is
even
truer
in
a
world
that
is
changing
as
quickly
as
today
s
with
new
technologies
jobs
and
industries
emerging
every
day
by
expecting
students
to
plan
their
future
too
early
on
we
put
an
unfair
burden
on
them
and
subject
many
to
discouragement
and
self doubt
thankfully
this
can
be
avoided
students
should
be
encouraged
to
delay
their
college
or
career
decisions
until
their
junior
year
when
they
have
gained
more
knowledge
about
different
paths
and
have
had
the
opportunity
to
gain
valuable
hands on
experiences
being
forced
to
make
decisions
before
they
are
ready
can
motivate
teenagers
to
make
bad
choices
and
contribute
to
feelings
of
inadequacy
and
unhappiness
among
this
age
group
providing
them
more
time
and
flexibility
allows
them
to
become
more
informed
and
confident
in
their
decisions
and
gives
them
the
much needed
time
to
explore
their
passions
and
talents
furthermore
by
taking
a
more
holistic
approach
to
education
and
training
students
are
likely
to
be
better
prepared
for
the
future
in
conclusion
it
is
not
advisable
to
expect
high
school
freshman
to
make
major
decisions
about
their
future
allowing
them
the
freedom
and
time
to
experiment
discover
and
learn
before
they
take
big
steps
towards
adulthood
will
undoubtedly
benefit
them
in
the
long
run
working
in
groups
or
working
alone
both
have
their
distinct
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
one
hand
working
in
groups
can
provide
support
collaboration
and
the
potential
for
great
ideas
to
come
out
of
open
discussion
on
the
other
hand
individual
work
can
foster
autonomy
a
higher
degree
of
creativity
and
focus
on
specific
tasks
ultimately
the
decision
of
which
approach
to
take
depends
heavily
on
the
individual
experiences
can
change
an
individual
s
perspective
on
which
approach
yields
better
results
person
who
was
successful
in
completing
a
project
on
their
own
might
find
more
solace
in
individual
work
while
a
person
who
was
part
of
a
successful
team
project
may
favor
the
benefits
of
working
in
a

environment
i
will
always
remember
the
joy
and
excitement
of
my
high
school
graduation
day
after
four
hard
years
of
academic
work
and
extracurricular
activities
finally
i
was
able
to
look
forward
to
the
bright
future
that
lay
ahead
of
me
on
that
day
i
felt
a
mix
of
emotions
happiness
relief
pride
and
anticipation
the
morning
started
with
a
lot
of
pageantry
i
wore
my
cap
and
gown
and
marched
in
procession
with
my
classmates
and
teachers
during
the
ceremony
i
couldn
t
help
but
feel
a
strong
sense
of
accomplishment
as
i
glanced
at
the
beaming
faces
around
me
we
had
all
worked
so
hard
and
come
so
far
after
being
awarded
my
diploma
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
outpouring
of
love
and
affection
from
my
classmates
parents
and
teachers
as
we
hugged
and
said
our
goodbyes
i
was
overwhelmed
with
emotion
and
nostalgia
we
had
all
gone
through
so
much
together
made
lasting
memories
and
been
a
support
for
each
other
over
many
years
i
will
never
forget
the
warm
embraces
and
exciting
cheers
from
my
loved
ones
this
is
why
i
will
cherish
that
special
moment
of
my
high
school
graduation
forever
attending
classes
online
provides
a
unique
opportunity
for
those
students
who
have
family
and
job
responsibilities
it
gives
students
more
flexibility
to
manage
their
time
allowing
them
to
pursue
their
academic
goals
without
compromising
their
other
commitments
this
type
of
learning
environment
also
offers
the
potential
for
students
to
balance
work
and
class
easily
as
they
can
access
courses
when
and
where
they
are
most
convenient
additionally
students
have
the
benefit
of
access
to
broader
course
offerings
since
online
classes
often
take
place
in
virtual
classrooms
which
can
be
located
anywhere
in
the
world
finally
it
can
be
a
cost effective
way
of
learning
since
online
instruction
can
be
more
affordable
than
traditional
classes
thus
attending
classes
online
can
offer
great
benefits
for
students
who
must
juggle
family
work
and
academic
responsibilities
setting
a
good
example
by
one
s
own
behavior
is
incredibly
important
it
not
only
reflects
an
individual
s
personal
values
and
character
but
also
impacts
the
surrounding
community
in
powerful
ways
by
setting
a
good
example
we
can
inspire
those
around
us
to
become
better
versions
of
themselves
through
a
combination
of
admiration
and
emulation
we
can
also
create
a
positive
environment
in
which
people
feel
inspired
and
supported
to
pursue
and
strive
for
success
when
individuals
lead
by
setting
a
good
example
their
positive
behaviors
are
bound
to
rub
off
on
those
they
interact
with
especially
those
in
their
immediate
network
during
difficult
situations
people
will
look
to
those
with
good
habits
for
guidance
as
such
it
is
crucial
to
strive
to
maintain
a
positive
demeanor
and
outlook
and
lead
with
integrity
and
kindness
in
order
to
inspire
others
to
do
the
same
the
potential
positive
consequences
of
setting
a
good
example
with
one
s
own
behavior
are
numerous
not
only
will
it
provide
an
individual
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
self worth
but
it
will
also
lead
to
an
increased
sense
of
mutual
respect
and
understanding
with
those
around
them
subsequently
setting
a
good
example
can
result
in
an
improved
quality
of
relationships
greater
chances
of
achieving
success
an
increased
level
of
trust
and
a
meaningful
contribution
to
putting
a
stop
to
negative
behaviors
and
situations
indeed
setting
a
good
example
by
one
s
own
behavior
can
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
lives
of
those
around
them
not
only
does
it
lead
to
personal
growth
but
it
also
encourages
a
positive
attitude
and
environment
in
which
everyone
can
thrive
and
share
in
a
more
successful
and
rewarding
outcome
the
saying
that
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
is
one
that
often
rings
true
in
many
situations
while
the
truth
of
this
statement
largely
depends
on
the
individual
s
personality
experiences
and
expectations
regarding
the
particular
person
or
situation
they
are
encountering
it
often
holds
true
that
a
person
s
initial
impressions
of
something
or
someone
can
be
hard
to
change
for
example
if
a
person
first
sees
another
person
they
deem
as
unapproachable
unfriendly
or
unkind
it
may
be
quite
difficult
to
convince
them
to
give
that
person
a
second
chance
this
becomes
especially
true
when
the
negative
first
impression
is
based
on
physical
appearances
pre existing
prejudices
or
any
type
of
prior
knowledge
of
the
person situation
in
question
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
instances
when
first
impressions
are
not
necessarily
set
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
with
deliberate
effort
and
the
willingness
to
look
past
one
s
initial
judgment
as
humans
we
are
capable
of
recognizing
our
own
biases
and
can
learn
to
consider
another
s
opinion
without
jumping
to
conclusions
with
the
right
attitude
and
a
readiness
to
learn
and
understand
it
is
possible
to
modify
one
s
first
impressions
and
develop
a
more
accurate
evaluation
of
the
person
or
situation
in
question
in
conclusion
while
first
impressions
are
usually
hard
to
shake
off
completely
it
is
definitely
not
an
impossible
feat
it
takes
an
open
mind
and
patience
to
change
one
s
opinion
and
create
a
different
perspective
but
with
the
right
attitude
it
is
achievable
technology
has
become
an
ever increasing
part
of
our
lives
with
both
positive
and
negative
consequences
that
must
be
thoroughly
examined
in
recent
years
technology
has
been
used
to
greatly
improve
various
aspects
of
daily
life
including
healthcare
education
and
transportation
doctors
are
now
able
to
use
technology
to
quickly
and
accurately
diagnose
illnesses
while
airports
are
being
outfitted
with
modern
equipment
to
reduce
wait
times
and
improve
efficiency
schools
are
incorporating
technology
more
and
more
into
their
curricula
allowing
students
to
become
more
informed
and
productive
members
of
society
despite
the
many
advantages
that
technology
provides
us
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
account
the
possible
negative
implications
of
technology
in
people
s
lives
such
as
the
potential
for
tech
addiction
and
data
manipulation
it
is
also
important
to
be
aware
of
the
various
types
of
technology
that
are
used
in
everyday
life
from
as
simple
as
our
phones
to
more
advanced
forms
like
artificial
intelligence
lastly
it
is
vital
to
practice
responsible
usage
when
interacting
with
technology
in
order
to
maximize
its
positive
impacts
in
our
lives
when
i
decided
to
take
on
this
challenge
there
was
a
lot
to
consider
from
researching
different
types
of
instruments
and
their
playing
techniques
to
memorizing
lines
of
s
plays
it
was
a
challenge
i
was
eager
to
take
on
to
ensure
my
presentation
for
the
science
fair
was
formidably
impressive
i
needed
to
select
the
best
project
and
make
sure
i
had
a
good
understanding
of
the
subject
and
a
clear
vision
of
what
i
wanted
to
accomplish
with
the
project
chosen
and
my
script
settled
on
i
set
about
learning
my
lines
and
practice
playing
the
instrument
that
i
would
use
for
the
performance
i
also
worked
on
creating
an
appropriate
costume
that
put
me
in
character
and
made
the
presentation
as
realistic
as
possible
with
months
of
dedicated
hard
work
i
was
ready
to
present
the
findings
of
my
project
alongside
my
original
work
the
performance
of
a
famous
play
by
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
traits
when
it
comes
to
success
in
life
people
with
a
positive
attitude
approach
situations
with
optimism
and
enthusiasm
which
in
turn
leads
to
better
outcomes
this
is
just
as
true
in
the
workplace
as
it
is
in
life
having
a
good
attitude
can
connect
people
to
more
opportunities
and
give
them
the
confidence
to
excel
having
a
good
attitude
also
helps
with
problem
solving
people
who
have
a
positive
outlook
are
more
likely
to
stay
focused
on
the
solutions
rather
than
getting
fixed
on
the
problems
this
mindset
can
help
them
come
to
better
and
more
realistic
solutions
moreover
having
a
good
attitude
can
reduce
stress
and
maximize
happiness
people
with
a
positive
attitude
can
better
handle
the
inevitable
challenges
that
life
will
bring
creating
a
more
fulfilling
and
rewarding
life
in
conclusion
having
a
good
attitude
is
essential
for
success
in
life
and
work
it
helps
with
connecting
with
more
opportunities
and
problem
solving
while
also
reducing
stress
and
maximizing
happiness
ultimately
it
is
up
to
each
individual
to
develop
a
positive
attitude
so
they
can
get
the
most
out
of
life
extracurricular
activities
offer
a
range
of
valuable
benefits
to
students
such
as
improving
college
admissions
providing
opportunities
for
scholarship
funding
developing
time
management
skills
and
helping
students
develop
personal
interests
however
there
is
an
ongoing
debate
about
whether
schools
should
be
in
control
of
which
activities
their
students
take
part
in
on
one
hand
schools
should
be
able
to
have
somerestriction
in
the
activities
students
participate
in
in
order
to
ensure
their
students
are
safe
and
they
can
practice
proper
supervision
on
the
other
hand
students
should
be
the
ones
ultimately
in
control
of
what
activities
they
take
part
in
as
such
activities
can
be
an
important
source
of
personal
growth
and
development
it
is
important
for
students
to
be
able
to
make
informed
decisions
about
the
activities
they
engage
in
as
those
activities
ultimately
have
an
impact
on
their
future
overall
it
should
be
the
students
who
have
the
final
say
on
the
extracurricular
activities
they
choose
to
participate
in
as
it
may
be
integral
to
their
development
online
classes
offer
a
unique
opportunity
for
students
who
need
extra
help
when
learning
through
virtual
learning
platforms
many
teachers
hold
virtual
office
hours
where
students
can
log
in
for
one on one
help
not
only
can
the
student
access
more
content
and
resources
with
the
features
of
the
digital
platform
but
they
also
have
the
chance
to
receive
individual
instruction
and
guidance
despite
the
potential
benefits
of
these
courses
there
are
challenges
that
prevent
some
students
from
getting
the
help
they
need
slow
internet
connections
lack
of
resources
and
parent teacher
disconnect
are
all
issues
to
consider
it
is
important
to
remember
that
these
students
may
not
get
the
same
level
of
resources
or
attention
as
their
traditional
classroom
peers
in
conclusion
online
classes
are
a
great
way
to
ensure
that
every
student
has
access
to
the
help
they
need
with
the
flexibility
of
virtual
learning
students
can
access
individual
support
regardless
of
their
physical
location
and
parents
can
become
more
involved
in
their
child
s
education
through
online
classes
students
from
all
backgrounds
can
gain
the
resources
they
need
to
succeed
is
a
central
theme
in
our
lives
it
is
the
process
through
which
we
learn
develop
and
become
increasingly
knowledgeable
and
independent
on
one
hand
growth
is
essential
for
personal
development
and
fulfilment
but
on
the
other
being
overly
avaricious
can
impede
our
progress
if
we
let
our
greed
drive
us
too
strongly
our
focus
shifts
away
from
building
a
healthier
version
of
ourselves
and
towards
taking
whatever
we
can
from
those
around
us
this
approach
ignores
the
importance
of
patience
resilience
and
respect
for
the
journey
that
growth
requires
it
is
human
nature
to
want
more
to
think
higher
of
ourselves
and
to
try
and
achieve
as
much
as
possible
however
that
drive
for
success
must
be
tempered
too
much
ambition
and
a
sense
of
entitlement
can
lead
to
an
attitude
of
arrogance
and
selfishness
in
a
quest
for
material
gain
we
might
ignore
or
fail
to
appreciate
the
range
of
experiences
that
only
come
with
honouring
the
process
of
growth
taking
shortcuts
in
order
to
obtain
success
more
quickly
can
lead
to
undeserved
unearned
successes
that
are
ultimately
hollow
and
in
some
cases
dangerous
being
mindful
of
our
motivations
is
essential
to
achieving
meaningful
growth
is
not
a
viable
foundation
for
personal
improvement
but
contentment
and
humility
are
by
eschewing
the
idea
that
more
is
better
we
can
focus
instead
on
the
small
steps
that
each
of
us
can
take
to
grow
closer
to
our
goals
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
our
true
worth
is
not
in
our
possessions
or
status
but
in
the
strength
of
our
character
traits
can
be
extremely
important
when
it
comes
to
tackling
a
variety
of
different
situations
when
entering
different
environments
such
as
the
home
the
job
or
the
school
it
is
important
to
choose
character
traits
that
fit
the
situation
for
example
one
may
need
to
be
patient
and
understanding
when
in
the
home
confident
and
productive
when
in
the
job
or
collaborative
and
respectful
when
in
the
school
choosing
the
right
character
trait
in
any
situation
can
also
be
key
to
success
having
the
flexibility
and
ability
to
assess
any
situation
and
choose
character
traits
that
are
most
appropriate
can
improve
a
person
s
chances
of
achieving
their
goals
ultimately
having
the
capacity
to
accurately
select
and
demonstrate
the
right
character
traits
in
any
environment
can
be
a
huge
advantage
attending
classes
from
home
via
online
or
video
conferencing
can
be
beneficial
for
students
with
busy
schedules
or
extenuating
circumstances
students
can
take
classes
at
their
own
pace
and
have
access
to
classes
that
may
not
be
available
in
their
local
school
district
however
attending
classes
online
can
also
be
more
challenging
than
attending
physical
classes
there
are
potential
distractions
such
as
access
to
phones
and
computers
as
well
as
a
lack
of
direct
contact
with
instructors
and
peers
although
attending
classes
online
can
have
its
advantages
there
are
also
many
benefits
to
attending
school
in
person
learning
in
a
physical
educational
environment
can
help
promote
collaboration
between
students
foster
relationships
with
teachers
and
provide
opportunities
to
engage
in
discussions
with
peers
attending
classes
in
person
can
also
prepare
students
for
their
future
career
paths
by
helping
them
gain
an
understanding
of
a
professional
environment
as

for
its

and
favorable

conditions
summers

of
high

and

and
winters
are
mild
and
damp
the
people
of

renowned
for
their
warmth
and
hospitality
the
culture
is
rich
in
friendly
traditions
and
the
locals
are
more
than
willing
to
help
visitors
the
shift
to
a
four day
school
week
is
becoming
more
and
more
common
among
schools
across
the
country
it
can
be
beneficial
in
terms
of
saving
money
on
transportation
and
utilities
improving
academic
results
and
allowing
teachers
and
staff
to
gain
additional
professional
development
opportunities
while
school
is
not
in
session
however
there
are
also
some
disadvantages
to
consider
such
as
added
stress
on
teachers
students
having
to
attend
longer
school
days
on
the
four
days
when
school
is
in
session
and
limiting
extracurricular
activities
due
to
the
shortened
school
week
extending
the
school
day
two
hours
for
students
to
gain
additional
academic
instruction
is
an
idea
that
is
gaining
traction
while
this
could
be
beneficial
as
it
would
provide
additional
instruction
time
it
would
also
mean
that
students
would
have
to
attend
longer
school
days
and
would
require
more
funding
in
order
to
staff
the
additional
teaching
hours
and
further
discussion
are
needed
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
extending
the
school
day
two
hours
is
a
feasible
idea
for
students
praising
a
student
s
work
can
be
a
tricky
situation
on
one
hand
some
people
agree
that
a
little
encouragement
goes
a
long
way
and
that
giving
positive
feedback
can
help
boost
an
individual
s
self esteem
even
if
they
didn
t
put
in
a
lot
of
effort
a
few
studies
have
suggested
that
words
of
affirmation
will
increase
self worth
and
improve
how
individuals
feel
about
themselves
especially
when
it
comes
from
someone
they
care
about
on
the
other
hand
some
argue
that
when
a
student
receives
too
much
praise
for
a
small
accomplishment
it
could
possibly
become
detrimental
to
their
self confidence
this
could
lead
to
a
false
sense
of
security
and
a
feeling
of
entitlement
making
them
believe
that
all
their
work
does
not
need
to
be
truly
outstanding
additionally
it
could
also
lead
to
an
unhelpful
attitude
of
complacency
and
expectations
that
achievements
should
come
easy
ultimately
when
it
comes
to
encouraging
student
s
work
and
efforts
it
is
important
to
find
the
right
balance
of
praise
and
constructive
criticism
too
much
of
either
will
not
be
beneficial
in
the
long
run
the
best
approach
is
to
set
realistic
standards
and
provide
realistic
feedback
to
students
so
that
they
can
reach
their
full
potential
the
push
to
conserve
resources
and
energy
is
well
underway
across
many
different
institutions
from
businesses
to
schools
schools
are
particularly
well
suited
to
implement
changes
in
practice
that
can
significantly
reduce
energy
usage
as
many
have
already
done
through
green
renovations
and
adopting
more
sustainable
practices
one
proposal
that
is
gaining
traction
is
for
schools
to
extend
their
day
two
hours
while
shortening
the
school
week
to
four
days
this
idea
has
both
its
benefits
and
drawbacks
and
they
should
be
carefully
weighed
before
any
policy
is
enacted
on
the
plus
side
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
coupled
with
a
four day
work
week
can
certainly
help
to
conserve
resources
and
energy
this
is
because
the
school
building
can
be
kept
at
a
more
stable
temperature
for
longer
periods
of
time
while
still
opening
and
closing
fewer
days
and
energy intensive
operations
like
air
conditioning
and
lighting
can
be
used
less
frequently
and
for
shorter
periods
of
time
this
can
also
lead
to
cost
savings
for
the
school
while
being
better
for
the
environment
overall
however
this
proposal
also
comes
with
some
drawbacks
for
one
the
extended
school
day
would
necessitate
an
extension
of
the
school
year
resulting
in
higher
costs
for
the
school
in
providing
more
instruction
and
greater
disruption
of
winter
and
summer
breaks
additionally
while
the
four day
work
week
may
offer
more
flexibility
for
teachers
it
could
create
more
stress
for
staff
and
administrators
who
would
have
to
fit
more
work
into
a
shorter
amount
of
time
finally
students particularly
older
students may
find
it
difficult
to
adjust
to
longer
days
ultimately
any
proposed
change
in
school
policies
should
be
evaluated
carefully
and
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
energy
and
resource
conservation
should
be
taken
into
account
it
is
important
to
consider
the
various
impacts
of
the
extended
school
day
and
four day
work
week
proposal
before
any
decisions
are
made
first
impressions
are
incredibly
important
and
they
can
be
very
difficult
to
change
our
demeanour
in
the
initial
moments
of
meeting
someone
greatly
affects
how
they
perceive
us
and
as
a
result
it
can
be
difficult
to
recover
from
a
bad
first
impression
we
tend
to
trust
our
initial
gut
instincts
and
remember
them
long
after
we
have
forgotten
overall
details
and
nuances
making
it
paramount
to
make
the
best
impression
the
first
time
to
start
studies
have
shown
that
people
form
opinions
about
others
within
seconds
of
meeting
them
and
these
opinions
can
become
deeply
entrenched
depending
on
the
context
the
person
s
demeanour
language
mannerisms
and
even
clothing
choices
can
have
an
extreme
impact
for
example
someone
in
a
business
setting
who
is
dressed
in
a
well tailored
suit
may
have
a
different
reception
than
someone
in
a
more
casual
setting
on
the
other
hand
a
person
s
attitude
and
behaviour
can
give
a
very
favourable
first
impression
as
well
a
friendly
and
confident
attitude
can
be
perceived
positively
while
someone
who
is
outgoing
and
engaging
can
be
well received
additionally
displaying
proper
etiquette
and
good
social
skills
can
give
a
good
impression
in
any
of
these
cases
the
kind
of
first
impression
someone
makes
can
be
deeply
affected
by
their
behaviour
in
conclusion
first
impressions
are
incredibly
important
and
can
be
difficult
to
change
though
our
demeur
can
play
a
key
role
in
how
people
initially
perceive
us
making
proper
choices
and
displaying
confidence
and
good
behaviour
can
create
a
favourable
first
impression
while
making
poor
choices
can
create
an
unfavourable
one
ultimately
being
mindful
of
our
demeanour
and
actions
can
make
all
the
difference
in
making
a
great
first
impression
in
the
current
digital
age
online
activities
such
as
shopping
playing
games
and
connecting
with
people
on
social
media
sites
have
revolutionized
the
way
in
which
groups
of
people
interact
there
are
numerous
potential
benefits
of
engaging
with
these
activities
such
as
the
ease
of
access
to
people
outside
of
your
geographical
area
or
the
ability
to
purchase
items
without
leaving
your
house
however
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
risks
associated
with
partaking
in
these
activities
as
well
for
example
scams
identity
theft
and
digital
addiction
we
live
in
a
world
where
staying
connected
is
becoming
increasingly
important
however
with
these
connections
come
some
important
caveats
undoubtedly
it
can
be
beneficial
to
remain
digitally
connected
with
the
world
and
have
access
to
others
insights
and
opportunities
however
it
is
also
crucial
to
keep
in
mind
that
not
everyone
needs
to
know
all
the
information
about
other
people
maintaining
the
boundaries
between
private
and
public
information
can
be
difficult
in
our
current
online focused
culture
and
therefore
requires
dedicated
effort
in
order
to
do
so
thus
it
is
important
to
remain
connected
with
the
digital
world
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
changing
times
while
also
establishing
limits
on
just
how
much
time
and
energy
are
put
into
these
activities
the
power
of
a
positive
attitude
can
not
be
underestimated
when
it
comes
to
leading
a
successful
life
of
one
s
specific
goals
and
ambitions
a
positive
attitude
is
often
the
essential
factor
in
achieving
one
s
ambitions
and
reaching
for
their
desired
success
a
positive
attitude
can
manifest
as
uplifting
thoughts
an
optimistic
outlook
and
a
general
feeling
of
joy
and
happiness
in
one
s
life
this
mindset
influences
our
emotions
and
actions
leading
us
to
make
more
empowered
decisions
and
positively
reinforce
our
relationships
with
ourselves
and
others
as
an
example
by
having
a
positive
attitude
one
can
be
motivated
to
engage
in
activities
which
challenge
and
encourage
personal
growth
when
facing
difficult
circumstances
a
positive
attitude
helps
by
allowing
us
to
cope
with
difficult
emotions
and
maintaining
overall
well being
yet
there
are
those
who
argue
that
too
much
positivity
can
in
fact
lead
to
a
loss
of
focus
and
inhibited
ambition
it
can
lead
to
a
false
sense
of
security
aversion
to
failure
and
an
unwillingness
to
confront
hard
truths
nevertheless
rather
than
promoting
a
relentless
ambition
a
positive
attitude
is
best
used
as
a
tool
to
overcome
challenges
and
shape
our
lives
to
our
desires
so
having
a
positive
attitude
is
not
a
guarantee
of
success
it
is
simply
a
tool
which
can
be
used
to
achieve
success
with
it
we
can
create
our
own
picture
of
success
rather
than
blindly
embracing
the
difficult
and
arduous
path
of
achievement
in
summary
having
a
positive
attitude
is
the
essential
factor
for
succeeding
in
life
as
it
allows
us
to
come
to
terms
with
our
difficulties
and
proactively
pursue
our
ambitions
advice
can
be
invaluable
for
helping
individuals
make
informed
decisions
in
school
having
a
trusted
mentor
or
peer
to
turn
to
can
make
it
easier
to
identify
the
best
path
forward
in
the
face
of
any
given
situation
has
found
that
advice
can
increase
an
individual
s
overall
ability
to
make
smart
decisions
by
providing
external
perspective
on
their
situation
and
identifying
potential
pitfalls
or
problematic
behavior
in
addition
having
a
reliable
opinion
can
also
build
self confidence
within
decision making
scenarios
as
it
provides
reassurance
that
the
chosen
path
is
a
considered
one
that
being
said
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
the
limits
of
advice taking
advice givers
don
t
necessarily
understand
the
intricacies
of
an
individual
s
situation
and
in
some
cases
may
put
their
own
feelings
or
judgments
ahead
of
others
feelings
or
best
interests
therefore
it
s
vital
to
use
advice
as
a
tool
to
inform
the
decision making
process
rather
than
relying
on
it
completely
it
s
also
important
to
have
a
source
of
advice
that
is
engaging
and
supportive
to
ensure
that
it
is
a
helpful
aid
when
making
decisions
ultimately
by
being
thoughtful
and
discerning
with
the
advice taking

individuals
can
make
better
decisions
and
be
rewarded

who
achieved
her
success
through
her
positive

for
her
optimism
and
enthusiastic
outlook
she
is
an
example
of
how
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
greater
success
in
life

and
sexual
abuse
maintained

and
worked
hard
to
become
a
successful
television
host
and
entrepreneur
having
a
positive
attitude
can
bring
benefits
in
many
areas
of

in
the
work
environment
having
a
positive
attitude
encourages
better
relationships
between

and
creates
a
culture
of
collaboration
and
commitment
similarly
when

comes
to

having
a
positive
attitude
helps
to
increase
academic
performance
and
mental
health
finally
in
relationships
having
a
positive
attitude
helps
to
create
connection
empathy
and
understanding
overall
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
creating
a
better
personality
and
morality
by
allowing
the
courage
to
reach
beyond

comfort
zone
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
greater
success
in
a
variety
of
life
areas
as
s
example
has
shown
having
a
positive
attitude
is
a
key
to
success
and
a
powerful
tool
in
achieving
life
goals
once
you
have
researched
how
to
gain
confidence
in
order
to
change
a
first
impression
it
is
important
to
look
within
yourself
and
reach
a
clear
vision
of
how
you
would
like
to
be
perceived
this
will
serve
as
the
bedrock
for
your
journey
after
reaching
this
point
it
is
time
to
formulate
a
plan
of
action
what
steps
are
necessary
to

hard
to
reach

up
with

can
act
as
an
excellent
opportunity
to
gain
the
necessary
skills
to
create
a
successful
plan
and
therefore
make
the
necessary
changes
to
how

self reliance
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
success
in

decisions
based
on
your
personal
values
and
goals
can
give
you
a
sense
of
pride
and
accomplishment
while
relying
on
the
guidance
of
authorities
or
experts
can
foster
feelings
of
helplessness
or

one
area
in

the
use
of
technology
in
everyday
life
has
the
potential
to
create
a
variety
of
risks
for
children
addictions
to
screens
loss
of
physical
sight
from
staring
at
devices
a
lack
of
communication
skills
and
the
danger
of
being
influenced
by
bad
content
can
all
be
potential
concerns
as
parents
it
is
important
to
limit
these
risks
by
creating
and
enforcing
healthy
habits
for
their
children
parents
should
limit
screen
time
encourage
outdoor
activities
and
keep
an
open
dialogue
with
their
children
to
promote
meaningful
connections
in
their
interactions
building
a
safe
and
healthy
relationship
with
technology
starts
with
the
parents
and
is
essential
for
the
wellbeing
of
future
generations
is
an
important
part
of
maintaining
healthy
relationships
and
building
trust
however
it
can
be
difficult
to
know
how
to
use
honesty
in
a
way
that
does
not
hurt
someone
s
feelings
while
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
be
truthful
it
can
be
difficult
to
phrase
things
in
a
way
that
s
gentle
and
kind
this
is
why
learning
how
to
be
both
honest
and
compassionate
is
essential
can
help
create
new
friendships
by
setting
a
foundation
of
mutual
respect
when
people
are
open
and
honest
with
one
another
from
the
start
they
often
form
much
stronger
connections
and
a
greater
level
of
trust
additionally
honest
conversations
can
help
clear
up
any
misunderstandings
or
disagreements
it
is
important
to
remember
that
being
honest
does
not
mean
being
blunt
or
unkind
while
it
is
necessary
to
be
honest
and
straightforward
it
must
be
done
in
a
way
that
benefits
both
parties
emotionally
and
physically
being
honest
can
be
especially
helpful
during
difficult
conversations
as
it
can
prevent
potential
hurt
feelings
or
misunderstanding
the
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
being
honest
is
that
it
can
help
create
new
friendships
and
maintain
healthy
relationships
learning
how
to
be
honest
while
also
being
mindful
of
others
feelings
is
an
important
skill
that
must
be
practiced
in
order
to
be
successful
with
practice
and
patience
honesty
can
lead
to
mutual
understanding
and
respect
adopting
the
approach
of
seeking
advice
from
multiple
people
is
a
great
way
to
gain
a
broad
variety
of
perspectives
this
can
provide
a
comprehensive
view
of
a
situation
and
allow
you
to
make
a
well informed
decision
additionally
multiple
perspectives
may
even
challenge
existing
thoughts
and
ideas
a
disadvantage
however
is
that
each
opinion
must
be
carefully
weighed
to
determine
the
most
suitable
advice
which
can
take
time
and
effort
additionally
there
is
a
potential
risk
of
too
many
ideas
becoming
overwhelming
and
hard
to
synthesize
ultimately
it
is
important
to
remember
that
seeking
advice
from
multiple
people
comes
with
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
so
it
s
important
to
figure
out
if
it
s
the
right
option
for
you
making
your
own
life
decisions
can
be
both
highly
rewarding
and
filled
with
challenges
it
offers
a
sense
of
individualism
autonomy
and
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
your
decisions
are
entirely
based
on
your
own
personal
values
and
feelings
on
the
other
hand
it
can
also
be
incredibly
stressful
as
the
sole
responsibility
for
the
outcome
of
your
decisions
lies
squarely
on
your
shoulders
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
also
offer
its
own
set
of
benefits
and
drawbacks
advice
may
provide
a
level
of
security
and
confidence
within
your
decisions
knowing
that
their
experience
and
knowledge
can
help
guide
you
properly
however
this
can
also
create
a
sense
of
passivity
or
dependence
upon
others
as
the
bulk
of
the
decisions
are
made
by
those
others
rather
than
by
yourself
ultimately
making
your
own
decisions
and
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
each
offer
advantages
depending
on
your
needs
and
preferences
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
both
the
benefits
and
potential
shortcomings
of
each
approach
so
that
your
decision making
process
can
be
tailored
to
meet
the
needs

was
a
british
naturalist
and
politician
who
made
a
major
impact
in
both
fields
he
was
a
major
proponent
for
the
study
of
nature
advocating
for
more
access
to
the
countryside
for
the
public
and
pushing
for
greater
recognition
for
the
role
that
natural
history
played
in
educating
the
public
he
was
also
an
influential
politician
and
peer
of
the
british
being
a
strong
voice
for
nature
conservation
and
scientific
exploration
s
accomplishments
show
how
the
ability
to
take
ownership
of
one
s
own
unique
traits
can
lead
to
success
by
embracing
his
passion
for
natural
history
and
his
pursuant
of
a
political
career
he
forged
a
unique
path
for
himself
his
unwillingness
to
confine
himself
to
any
one
path
enabled
him
to
bring
an
unprecedented
perspective
to
both
the
political
and
scientific
worlds
making
him
a
revolutionary
figure
in
both
he
serves
as
an
example
of
the
power
of
freedom
of
choice
and
determination
to
make
a
mark
on
the
world
it
is
widely
accepted
that
knowledge
can
be
a
great
source
of
power
and
success
in
our
lives
one
way
that
knowledge
can
lead
to
financial
success
is
through
the
creation
of
something
tangible
for
example
thanks
to
the
invention
of
the
light
bulb
by
in
he
and
other
inventors
were
able
to
make
a
great
financial
gain
this
knowledge
gave
the
power
to
discover
more
technologies
and
inventions
which
in
turn
allowed
him
to
become
one
of
the
most
successful
inventors
in
history
not
only
did
acquire
financial
success
with
his
inventions
but
other
inventors
and
innovators
have
had
the
same
success
in
recent
years
take
for
example
the
invention
of
the
printer
which
has
revolutionized
the
field
of
manufacturing
through
their
knowledge
of
advanced
engineering
and
usage
of
the
printing
technology
inventors
have
been
able
to
create
profitable
businesses
designing
and
printing
complex
products
another
way
knowledge
can
lead
to
financial
success
is
through
the
power
that
comes
with
understanding
the
way
the
world
works
people
who
are
knowledgeable
in
a
particular
field
like
finance
business
or
marketing
can
use
their
knowledge
to
their
advantage
and
increase
their
financial
stability
understanding
how
the
markets
work
how
a
business
is
structured
and
the
way
people
buy
and
sell
products
are
all
examples
of
knowledge
that
can
be
used
to
drive
financial
success
ultimately
knowledge
is
an
incredibly
powerful
tool
that
can
be
used
in
many
different
ways
to
create
real
things
generate
financial
success
and
increase
power
for
those
who
invest
the
time
and
energy
to
learn
whether
it
be
through
inventing
products
or
understanding
how
the
markets
works
knowledge
has
the
potential
to
lead
to
many
great
opportunities
the
power
of
example
and
past
experiences
of
one
person
to
influence
the
decisions
and
goals
of
others
has
been
demonstrated
time
and
time
again
take
the
example
of
a
civil
rights
law
advocate
who
used
her
own
determination
and
inspiration
from
the
people
around
her
to
become
a
leading
advocate
for
children
s
rights
is
an
example
of
someone
whose
goals
were
achieved
due
to
the
influence
of
those
around
her
conversely
people
can
be
influenced
to
not
achieve
their
goals
due
to
lack
of
influence
this
is
seen
in
the
case
of
students
in
schools
with
a
lack
of
resources
funding
or
encouragement
where
the
students
may
not
have
the
support
they
need
to
push
them
towards
their
educational
goals
without
sufficient
resources
and
guidance
these
students
may
not
succeed
in
achieving
their
goals
because
their
motivation
is
curtailed
by
the
lack
of
positive
influence
from
their
environment
in
today
s
world
online
classes
are
becoming
an
increasingly
popular
way
to
access
education
they
are
a
valuable
tool
for
those
who
can
not
attend
traditional
schools
due
to
personal
or
financial
reasons
as
a
result
online
classes
are
fast
becoming
an
important
option
for
students
who
want
to
pursue
their
educational
goals
when
compared
to
traditional
school
methods
online
classes
offer
several
advantages
they
are
more
accessible
since
they
can
be
used
from
virtually
anywhere
and
require
a
much
smaller
investment
students
can
choose
how
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
and
can
also
have
the
flexibility
to
work
around
their
other
commitments
moreover
online
classes
tend
to
be
more
engaging
and
interactive
as
students
can
communicate
with
each
other
and
the
teacher
via
email
discussion
forums
and
even
video
conferencing
on
the
other
hand
online
classes
can
also
be
challenging
for
some
students
for
example
self discipline
is
a
critical
factor
for
online
students
and
they
must
have
a
great
deal
of
commitment
and
dedication
in
order
to
stay
on
track
with
their
studies
additionally
a
lack
of
direct
contact
with
teachers
and
other
students
can
limit
the
learning
experience
and
prevent
students
from
fully
absorbing
the
material
overall
it
is
clear
that
online
classes
can
be
an
effective
option
for
students
looking
to
further
their
education
they
offer
a
number
of
advantages
that
are
not
available
with
traditional
school
methods
while
also
introducing
new
challenges
that
must
be
navigated
by
carefully
considering
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
option
students
can
make
an
informed
decision
that
is
right
for
them
the
advancement
of
technology
has
had
an
immense
effect
on
people
s
lives
drastically
influencing
the
way
we
research
shop
and
communicate
it
has
become
increasingly
easier
for
busy
and
disabled
individuals
to
access
the
resources
they
need
services
such
as
can
be
used
to
connect
with
help
faster
and
even
those
with
limited
resources
can
shop
online
for
things
they
need
the
role
of
technology
in
the
military
is
an
especially
important
one
it
has
improved
immensely
over
the
years
from
biots
to
smart
weapons
and
weapons
systems
is
used
a
crucial
asset
in
modern
warfare
contributing
to
successful
battlefield
strategies
the
notion
that
technology
promotes
laziness
can
incite
heated
debate
on
one
hand
technology
can
be
used
to
free
up
time
giving
people
more
opportunities
to
rest
and
pursue
leisure
activities
on
the
other
hand
technology
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
expansion
and
learning
allowing
us
to
further
our
knowledge
and
expertise
in
any
case
it
is
important
to
consider
how
technology
is
being
used
and
be
mindful
of
its
implications
a
four day
school
week
with
each
day
lasting
ten
hours
may
seem
to
be
an
appealing
option
as
it
has
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
students
teachers
and
school
staff
for
students
it
would
give
them
more
free
time
in
their
week
to
pursue
hobbies
or
focus
on
individual
research
projects
it
could
also
allow
teachers
more
flexibility
to
plan
ahead
and
their
teaching
approach
as
well
as
the
ability
to
cover
more
material
in
a
certain
amount
of
time
however
it
could
be
difficult
to
accommodate
certain
classes
that
require
in person
student
participation
such
as
science
experiments
or
exercises
within
a
physical
classroom
setting
on
the
other
hand
for
school
staff
a
four day
school
week
with
ten
hours
per
day
could
mean
working
more
hours
within
those
days
depending
on
the
school
s
other
services
such
as
extracurricular
activities
and
on site
care
this
could
mean
added
demands
that
would
be
outside
of
traditional
school
hours
whether
this
is
an
attainable
option
depends
on
the
resources
the
school
has
available
to
provide
these
services
and
support
staff
in
conclusion
a
four day
school
week
with
ten
hours
per
day
could
be
a
feasible
option
for
your
school
depending
on
a
variety
of
factors
it
has
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
students
and
teachers
as
well
as
considerations
for

view
of

without
being
limited
by

days
or
adopting
a
four
day
school
week
can
be
a
viable
way
for
schools
to
promote
conserving
energy
and
resources
on
one
hand
extending
school
days
means
that
a
school
can
do
more
to
conserve
energy
as
they
can
turn
off
certain
lights
or
air
conditioners
earlier
each
day
furthermore
it
could
give
students
more
time
to
practice
energy
conservation
habits
such
as
recycling
reducing
water
usage
and
the
unplugging
of
electronics
when
not
in

four
day
school
week
could

the
amount
of
energy
needed
to
transport

in
some
scenarios

can
benefit
from
periods
of
inactivity

can
have
positive
results
such
as
developing

skills
that
attract

and
opportunities
in
life
when
i
started
my
new
career
i
had
to
learn
a
number
of
new
concepts
and
skills
my
attitude
changed
immediately
i
had
a
newfound
respect
for
the
importance
of
education
and
its
ability
to
equip
me
with
the
necessary
tools
to
be
successful
in
my
career
one
particular
subject
that
i
did
not
think
was
important
in
school
was
mathematics
i
felt
it
would
never
be
applicable
to
my
life
or
career
so
why
bother
learning
it
but
gradually
i
came
to
understand
the
importance
of
mathematics
skills
in
my
job
basic
mathematical
concepts
are
essential
for
tasks
like
counting
stock
calculating
payroll
and
monitoring
financial
data
all
important
parts
of
my
job
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
a
good

in
a

is
the
foundation
for
a

provides
the
knowledge
and
skills
needed
to

ready
for
life
s
ever changing
challenges
after
researching
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
finishing
school
in
three
or
four
years
i
determined
that
it
can
sometimes
be
beneficial
for
a
student
to
finish
school
in
one
year
early
for
hispanic
students
finishing
school
in
three
or
four
years
could
mean
completing
their
educational
requirements
sooner
in
order
to
secure
a
job
and
support
their
families
this
could
give
them
increased
access
to
more
opportunities
than
other
students
on
the
other
hand
some
hispanic
students
may
prefer
to
stay
in
school
to
enrich
their
educational
experience
or
to
delay
entering
into
the
job
market
american
students
also
have
advantages
and
disadvantages
when
it
comes
to
leaving
school
early
or
working
full time
working
full time
means
that
they
could
gain
valuable
job
experience
but
might
have
less
time
for
studying
or
extracurricular
activities
on
the
other
hand
finishing
school
in
three
or
four
years
could
help
american
students
accelerate
their
career
paths
and
graduate
with
less
debt
considering
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
hispanic
and
american
students
i
believe
that
finishing
school
in
three
or
four
years
is
usually
the
best
option
it
allows
students
to
gain
a
more
comprehensive
educational
experience
while
still
allowing
them
the
opportunity
to
join
the
job
market
at
a
younger
age
recent
studies
have
been
conducted
to
research
the
impact
of
device
usage
on
students
academic
performance
the
presence
of
devices
in
the
classroom
can
be
a
source
of
distraction
leading
to
decreased
academic
performance
around
the
world
have
instituted
policies
regarding
the
use
of
devices
in
the
classroom
with
varying
levels
of
success
there
are
several
strategies
for
mitigating
the
negative
effects
of
device
usage
in
the
classroom
such
as
discouragement
of
use
during
instruction
or
implementation
of
specific
software
and
tools
for
educational
purposes
these
strategies
are
meant
to
harness
the
potential
of
technology
while
limiting
the
interference
of
digital
distraction
the
path
to
achieving
any
goal
is
often
difficult
littered
with
unexpected
roadblocks
and
challenges
but
with
perseverance
and
resilience
even
the
most
ambitious
and
seemingly
insurmountable
goals
can
be
achieved
by
allowing
ourselves
to
stay
focused
and
committed
even
when
faced
with
adversity
we
make
the
journey
to
our
goals
easier
and
faster
is
an
invaluable
characteristic
for
anyone
striving
to
reach
their
goals
without
it
it
s
all
too
easy
to
give
up
when
faced
with
the
obstacles
that
come
along
the
way
no
matter
the
size
of
the
roadblock
or
challenge
persistence
allows
us
to
press
on
and
develop
a
can
do
attitude
rather
than
succumbing
to
a
ca
n t
do
attitude
this
in
turn
gives
us
the
necessary
willpower
and
determination
to
push
on
and
ultimately
make
progress
toward
our
goals
resilience
is
also
an
important
part
of
achieving
our
objectives
when
the
going
gets
tough
and
the
challenge
seems
insurmountable
resilience
helps
us
to
stay
strong
and
keep
believing
in
ourselves
it
allows
us
to
pick
ourselves
up
after
a
failure
or
misstep
and
remind
ourselves
that
we
can
and
will
achieve
our
goals
without
resilience
it
s
easy
to
give
up
and
never
take
those
important
steps
forward
by
combining
persistence
and
resilience
we
can
arm
ourselves
with
the
positive
attitude
and
motivation
needed
to
tackle
any
obstacle
this
in
turn
can
give
us
the
confidence
to
make
the
necessary
changes
and
take
the
necessary
action
to
ultimately
achieve
our
goals
so
wherever
you
re
headed
on
your
journey
don

forget
to
take
along
the
essential
companions
of
persistence
and
resilience
implementing
a
curfew
for
teenagers
can
have
a
positive
impact
on
crime
rates
and
public
safety
in
cities
studies
show
that
curfews
can
help
reduce
the
amount
of
criminal
activity
that
occurs
late
at
night
by
requiring
teenagers
to
be
home
at
certain
times
it
eliminates
potential
opportunities
for
crime
especially
among
young
people
furthermore
it
also
gives
parents
peace
of
mind
knowing
that
their
children
are
safe
and
not
engaging
in
potentially
dangerous
activities
creating
a
curfew
also
has
economic
benefits
by
reducing
the
amount
of
criminal
activity
in
public
spaces
it
can
help
create
a
better
and
safer
environment
which
creates
a
better
quality
of
life
for
citizens
additionally
this
can
also
boost
local
businesses
who
may
suffer
from
broken
windows
and
loitering
admittedly
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
implementing
a
curfew
such
as
potentially
infringing
on
the
rights
of
young
people
by
preventing
them
from
participating
in
certain
activities
to
counter
this
cities
could
offer
alternative
activities
geared
towards
teenagers
and
create
a
safe
environment
for
them
to
congregate
implementing
a
curfew
for
teenagers
can
be
beneficial
for
many
reasons
it
can
help
reduce
crime
and
keep
the
public
safe
as
well
as
offer
economic
benefits
to
cities
however
cities
should
also
strive
to
create
safe
and
engaging
activities
for
teenagers
and
provide
them
with
opportunities
to
stay
out
of
trouble
graduating
early
from
high
school
has
the
potential
to
offer
certain
advantages
however
there
are
also
some
disadvantages
that
should
be
taken
into
account
on
the
positive
side
graduating
early
might
give
students
an
extra
jump
start
on
their
college
education
or
future
career
it
can
make
it
possible
to
take
classes
that
weren
t
available
during
traditional
high
school
and
it
could
help
students
to
become
more
independent
and
prepare
for
the
responsibilities
of
adult
life
on
the
other
hand
graduating
early
can
also
have
negative
effects
it
can
mean
that
some
classes
were
skipped
due
to
an
accelerated
schedule
which
could
result
in
a
lack
of
fundamental
knowledge
or
critical
skills
additionally
there
can
be
a
risk
of
missing
out
on
unique
high
school
experiences
like
dances
sports
or
summer
activities
which
could
be
regretful
in
the
long
run
ultimately
the
decision
to
graduate
early
is
a
personal
choice
that
is
dependent
on
individual
circumstances
nevertheless
students
should
take
the
time
to
consider
all
of
the
potential
pros
and
cons
before
deciding
to
pursue
an
early
graduation
s
famous
phrase
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
can
serve
as
a
powerful
reminder
that
moments
of
failure
do
not
have
to
be
the
end
of
our
journey
instead
they
can
be
learning
opportunities
and
stepping
stones
that
allow
us
to
better
understand
our
own
strength
and
determination
even
in
the
face
of
difficult
situations

indicative
of
this
philosophy
throughout

and
setbacks
always
displaying
an
indomitable
spirit
and
willingness

experiences
even
in
the

of
criticism
continued
to

in
his
pursuit
of

highlighting
the
importance
of
maintaining
enthusiasm
even
in
the
face
of
failure
by
applying
s
words
to
our
everyday
lives
we
can
be
reminded
that
failure
does
not
have
to
be
a
deterrent
to
reaching
our
goals
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
of
curfews
for
teenagers
opinions
widely
vary
a
curfew
is
imposed
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
teens
by
limiting
the
amount
of
time
they
can
be
out
of
parental
or
adult
supervision
advocates
for
strict
curfews
indicate
that
this
practice
has
potential
benefits
like
reducing
teen
delinquency
and
crime
reducing
the
risks
of
young
people
falling
victim
to
drugs
and
alcohol
and
creating
a
sense
of
order
and
structure
in
a
youth
s
life
critics
of
curfews
argue
that
these
rules
may
be
counter productive
in
some
cases
for
example
in
places
where
curfews
are
strictly
enforced
it
can
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
teen
s
safety
by
causing
them
to
flee
from
or
avoid
law
enforcement
during
an
emergency
in
addition
it
can
over restrict
teens
hampering
their
ability
to
develop
healthy
time
management
skills
and
even
negatively
impact
their
academic
performance
ultimately
it
is
up
to
parents
and
guardians
to
assess
whether
curfews
are
appropriate
for
their
teens
and
how
they
should
be
implemented
when
curfews
are
enforced
properly
and
in
moderation
they
can
be
effective
in
promoting
safety
and
instilling
good
habits
and
values
in
teens
ultimately
curfews
are
just
one
of
many
tools
available
to
parents
and
guardians
to
ensure
their
teens
safety
wellbeing
and
success
finding
out
who
i
am
and
what
my
purpose
in
life
is
is
not
an
easy
task
many
people
rely
on
family
and
friends
for
guidance
but
it
can
be
difficult
to
really
listen
to
your
own
inner
voice
often
puts
pressure
on
us
to
follow
a
certain
path
and
being
true
to
ourselves
can
be
challenging
amidst
it
all
i
want
to
remain
dedicated
to
my
own
sense
of
identity
and
not
be
swayed
by
the
opinions
of
others
to
stay
true
to
myself
i
will
strive
to
take
time
to
reflect
and
be
mindful
of
my
own
thoughts
and
feelings
i
will
prioritize
my
own
needs
carve
out
time
for
things
i
m
passionate
about
and
allow
myself
to
explore
potential
interests
by
being
actively
conscious
and
true
to
myself
i
can
discover
who
i
am
and
what
i
am
meant
to
do
it
is
clear
that
curfews
for
minors
are
a
necessary
part
of
society
especially
in
urban
centers
where
crime
is
more
common
without
curfews
minors
are
left
vulnerable
to
dangerous
situations
that
can
arise
in
urban
environments
when
not
supervised
by
an
adult
as
a
parent
i
know
the
importance
of
teaching
my
children
right
from
wrong
and
the
value
of
having
a
safe
place
for
them
to
go
when
out
late
in
the
city
one
example
of
the
dangers
minors
face
if
they
are
out
late
at
night
comes
from
a
news
story
i
heard
recently
about
a
teenage
girl
in
the
city
being
assaulted
on
her
way
home
from
school
the
story
made
an
impression
on
me
as
it
highlighted
the
need
for
a
curfew
to
protect
young
people
from
similar
situations
it
is
important
to
teach
minors
why
curfews
are
necessary
so
they
understand
the
importance
of
being
safe
having
a
set
curfew
provides
a
structure
that
dictates
when
it
is
time
to
come
home
allowing
parents
to
rest
easy
that
their
children
will
be
in
their
care
at
an
expected
time
also
provide
an
enforcement
mechanism
to
help
ensure
minors
are
abiding
by
the
rules
and
making
wise
decisions
when
out
late
at
night
from
a
legal
standpoint
they
also
protect
minors
from
certain
adult
activities
that
may
be
considered
inappropriate
for
their
age
in
conclusion
there
is
an
undeniable
need
for
cities
to
set
curfews
for
minors
in
order
to
protect
them
from
the
potential
dangers
of
late
night
urban
travel
also
provide
an
effective
enforcement
mechanism
to
ensure
minors
are
making
wise
decisions
and
a
safe
environment
for
parents
to
know
when
their
children
will
return
home
personal
experience
and
news
coverage
have
demonstrated
the
potential
risks
of
allowing
minors
to
roam
late
at
night
in
an
urban
environment
this
provides
ample
reason
to
support
city
councils
adopting
a
curfew
for
minors
setting
a
good
example
is
the
best
way
to
influence
others
for
a
variety
of
reasons
it
sets
a
clear
vision
for
how
a
person
or
an
organization
thinks
and
behaves
for
example
was
a
prime
example
of
someone
who
set
a
high
moral
standard
that
extended
beyond
his
own
actions
his
commitment
to
equality
inspired
millions
to
act
justly
and
bring
about
much needed
reform
during
the
civil
rights
movement
setting
a
positive
example
can
lead
to
greater
motivation
in
others
take
for
example
a
personal
trainer
by
setting
a
good
example
of
discipline
and
dedication
they
will
often
be
able
to
encourage
clients
to
strive
to
reach
their
personal
goals
finally
setting
a
good
example
models
the
desired
behavior
and
helps
to
foster
a
sense
of
inclusion
and
mutual
respect
among
team
members
this
can
create
an
environment
that
is
conducive
to
open
and
honest
communication
leading
to
greater
collaboration
and
problem solving
setting
a
good
example
is
indeed
the
best
way
to
influence
others
from
s
courageous
stances
to
the
motivating
example
of
a
personal
trainer
setting
a
positive
example
can
have
far reaching
ripple
effects
one
way
school
administrators
can
attempt
to
create
an
environment
conducive
to
learning
is
by
regulating
the
use
of
phones
during
school
lunch
on
the
one
hand
having
a
policy
that
allows
the
use
of
phones
during
school
lunch
can
create
a
more
relaxed
atmosphere
and
provide
students
with
an
opportunity
to
unwind
and
connect
with
friends
and
family
outside
of
the
classroom
allowing
phones
during
lunch
can
make
it
easier
for
students
to
access
educational
resources
such
as
online
dictionaries
and
fact checking
websites
on
the
other
hand
having
a
policy
that
does
not
allow
phones
during
school
lunch
can
help
create
an
environment
that
is
less
distracting
for
both
students
and
staff
this
can
allow
students
to
focus
on
their
lunch
and
conversations
with
their
peers
while
providing
a
break
from
constant
phone
use
additionally
not
allowing
phones
during
lunch
can
also
reduce
the
risk
of
data
misuse
as
students
become
less
exposed
to
social
media
and
online
services
ultimately
each
school
will
need
to
decide
which
policy
is
appropriate
for
its
setting
in
order
to
create
a
safe
and
supportive
school
environment
is
widely
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
influential
british
politicians
of
the
twentieth
century
as
his
actions
helped
to
guide
the
nation
through
some
of
its
darkest
hours
during
and
reshaped
british
politics
his
actions
were
highly
respected
and
applauded
by
the
british
people
and
he
was
awarded
numerous
accolades
such
as
the
order
of
the
and
in
also
had
a
substantial
impact
on
the
british
government
s
approach
to
bettering
the
lives
of
its
citizens
he
enacted
reforms
to
protect
workers
rights
introduce
free
access
to
healthcare
and
establish
the
to
provide
economic
support
for
those
in
need
under
s
leadership
the
british
government
also
implemented
ambitious
reconstruction
plans
following
the
conclusion
of
the
war
today
local
mayors
continue
the
tradition
of
ensuring
british
citizens
experience
a
quality
of
life
in
towns
and
cities
across
the
country
efforts
are
being
made
to
help
those
in
need
with
housing
employment
and
education
support
in
particular
local
authorities
have
committed
to
tackling
poverty
and
inequality
as
well
as
providing
better
access
to
healthcare
and
other
essential
services
through
this
the

providing
invaluable
support
to
their

improve
the

of
british
citizens
failure
is
an
important
part
of
success
without
experiencing
failure
we
can
not
recognize
how
to
identify
and
mitigate
the
risks
associated
with
taking
chances
it
is
only
after
making
mistakes
that
we
can
learn
the
necessary
lessons
needed
to
overcome
challenges
and
achieve
success
for
example
famously
failed
multiple
times
while
working
on
the
light
bulb
before
eventually
achieving
success
his
famous
quote
i
have
not
failed
i
ve
just
found
ways
that
wo
n t
work
encapsulates
the
importance
of
failure
in
learning
and
achieving
success
similarly
people
who
are
successful
in
sports
or
business
can
often
point
to
an
experience
that
seemed
like
a
failure
but
ended
up
teaching
them
a
valuable
lesson
ultimately
failure
can
be
the
key
to
unlocking
success
in
life
it
gives
us
opportunities
to
learn
and
grow
and
allows
us
to
unlock
our
true
potential
by
embracing
failure
and
taking
risks
we
can
put
ourselves
in
a
much
better
position
to
succeed
the
differences
between
older
and
younger
students
have
been
researched
extensively
speaking
younger
students
tend
to
have
higher
intelligence
levels
as
they
are
still
in
the
early
stages
of
their
development
however
older
students
may
benefit
from
greater
focus
and
maturity
and
may
therefore
be
better
prepared
for
tests
when
it
comes
to
school
programs
differences
between
age
groups
depend
largely
on
the
school
system
itself
for
example
most
systems
provide
additional
support
for
younger
students
such
as
tutoring
or
mentoring
while
older
students
may
receive
more
advanced
instruction
despite
the
differences
between
age
groups
there
are
many
commonalities
as
well
both
younger
and
older
students
have
the
capacity
to
learn
grow
and
succeed
and
both
groups
must
abide
by
the
laws
that
govern
student
behavior
and
school
performance
ultimately
while
older
and
younger
students
may
have
different
strengths
and
weaknesses
they
both
have
the
same
goal
to
maximize
their
own
potential
and
achieve
the
best
academic
experience
possible
i
remember
one
of
my
friends
who
recently
decided
to
take
online
classes
she
was
so
excited
about
all
the
flexibility
and
convenience
it
offered
her
but
as
time
passed
she
found
it
difficult
to
stick
to
a
schedule
and
stay
on
top
of
all
her
assignments
one
day
i
checked
in
on
her
progress
and
saw
that
she
had
fallen
behind
on
more
than
half
of
her
courses
she
was
overwhelmed
by
all
the
assignments
she
had
to
complete
so
she
started
procrastinating
and
ended
up
missing
important
deadlines
it
was
a
real
eye opener
for
me
i
quickly
realized
why
it
s
so
important
for
students
to
come
to
school
instead
of
taking
online
classes
when
you
re
in
a
physical
classroom
you
ca
n t
procrastinate
as
easily
plus
there
s
less
chance
for
distractions
since
you
re
surrounded
by
your
peers
and
teachers
additionally
coming
to
school
holds
you
more
responsible
for
your
work
since
you
re
in
a
learning
environment
surrounded
by
other
students
it
puts
you
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
take
your
studies
seriously
with
online
classes
it
s
hard
to
maintain
that
sense
of
responsibility
may
seem
daunting
at
times
but
it
s
ultimately
the
best
way
to
prepare
yourself
for
the
future
it
teaches
you
important
lessons
in
responsibility
organization
and
self discipline all
skills
that
will
be
beneficial
in
the
long
run
so
if
you
re
ever
considering
taking
online
classes
over
going
to
school
always
remember
the
experience
of
my
friend it
may
be
more
convenient
in
the
short term
but
it
s
not
worth
it
in
the
long
run
graduating
from
high
school
early
with
all
required
credits
can
be
a
beneficial
option
for
some
students
however
it
s
important
to
understand
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
before
making
a
decision
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
graduating
early
is
that
students
gain
an
early
start
on
their
educational
journey
this
means
that
students
can
start
pursuing
their
college
education
earlier
allowing
them
to
potentially
save
money
on
tuition
by
graduating
sooner
or
using
their
earned
credits
towards
future
higher
education
additionally
students
may
benefit
from
increased
career
opportunities
that
may
come
with
graduating
from
high
school
at
an
earlier
age
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
drawbacks
to
graduating
from
high
school
early
for
instance
students
may
miss
out
on
some
social
activities
and
experiences
that
come
with
being
in
high
school
with
peers
furthermore
students
may
be
at
a
disadvantage
when
moving
on
to
higher
education
in
terms
of
maturity
as
they
may
not
have
had
the
chance
to
experience
the
same
academic
and
social
challenges
as
their
older
peers
some
students
may
find
themselves
unprepared
for
the
rigors
of
college
if
they
have
n t
had
the
benefit
of
a
full
high
school
experience
in
conclusion
graduating
from
high
school
early
with
all
required
credits
is
a
great
option
for
some
students
but
it
s
important
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
before
making
a
decision
it
is
no
surprise
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
play
a
major
role
in
how
successful
we
are
in
life
has
shown
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
increase
our
chances
of
accomplishing
our
goals
as
well
as
help
us
to
remain
motivated
and
strive
for
more
success
on
the
other
hand
having
a
negative
attitude
can
have
many
detrimental
effects
not
just
on
our
mental
health
but
also
on
our
ability
to
achieve
success
studies
have
shown
that
those
with
a
negative
attitude
are
more
likely
to
become
discouraged
and
give
up
when
faced
with
any
kind
of
difficulty
furthermore
having
a
negative
attitude
can
make
it
difficult
for
us
to
take
full
advantage
of
opportunities
that
may
come
our
way
such
as
graduating
from
high
school
or
getting
a
job
finally
a
positive
attitude
can
be
incredibly
beneficial
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
as
it
can
give
us
the
necessary
motivation
and
confidence
to
take
risks
we
might
otherwise
be
too
afraid
to
take
and
pursue
our
most
ambitious
goals
two
is
better
than
one
is
an
innovative
program
that
seeks
to
bridge
the
divide
between
younger
and
older
generations
by
promoting
collaboration
and
inter generational
understanding
the
program
promotes
the
idea
that
success
can
be
achieved
through
failure
as
knowledge
and
understanding
is
gained
every
time
a
challenge
is
attempted
communication
between
different
generations
is
essential
for
this
program
to
succeed
as
insights
and
perspectives
from
both
younger
and
older
students
can
be
mutually
beneficial
personally
i
benefitted
greatly
from
using
two
is
better
than
one
while
studying
for
my
driving
license
exam
having
the
assistance
of
someone
from
a
different
age
group
helped
me
to
better
understand
difficult
concepts
provided
helpful
tips
for
passing
the
test
and
increased
my
motivation
to
keep
studying
i
learned
that
having
a
helping
hand
even
if
it
s
from
an
unlikely
source
can
make
the
biggest
of
challenges
seem
more
achievable
i
will
forever
be
thankful
for
the
experience
two
is
better
than
one
gave
me
is
often
referred
to
as
the
key
to
success
and
it
s
true
knowledge
can
open
many
doors
giving
us
access
to
unique
opportunities
in
life
while
imagination
can
be
important
in
coming
up
with
creative
ideas
knowledge
is
the
essential
ingredient
in
taking
action
on
those
ideas
it
is
knowledge
that
allows
us
to
make
decisions
solve
complex
problems
and
develop
plans
of
action
imagination
allows
us
to
visualize
possibilities
and
dream
up
creative
solutions
to
problems
but
this
is
only
the
first
half
of
success
we
need
knowledge
to
make
our
dreams
a
reality
of
the
world
around
us
and
the
various
systems
at
work
in
society
gives
us
the
power
to
turn
creative
ideas
into
tangible
plans
of
action
the
ability
to
effectively
utilize
knowledge
also
gives
us
the
capacity
to
identify
risks
and
think
ahead
can
help
us
to
create
strategies
for
navigating
the
complexity
of
the
world
around
us
keeping
us
one
step
ahead
of
our
competitors
and
giving
us
an
edge
in
our
respective
industries
is
thus
a
fundamental
tool
for
growth
and
success
in
the
end
we
can
see
why
knowledge
is
more
important
than
imagination
is
essential
to
giving
us
the
ideas
and
visions
that
can
shape
our
lives
but
it
is
knowledge
that
gives
us
the
capacity
to
carry
out
those
ideas
thus
without
knowledge
our
dreams
will
remain
just
that
dreams
only
when
combined
with
knowledge
can
our
ideas
become
reality
is
an
expression
of
emotion
an
art
form
and
a
physical
activity
that
can
bring
great
joy
to
those
who
take
part
in
it
from
the
finesse
of
ballet
to
the
rhythmic
taps
of
tap
the
powerful
beats
of
hip
hop
the
swinging
jazz
and
the
intimate
movements
of
ballroom
dancing
each
style
brings
a
unique
way
of
expressing
one
s
self
to
properly
and
safely
dance
physical
activity
and
nutrition
are
necessary
for
dancers
to
remain
fit
and
energized
like
regular
athletes
working
on
technique
and
training
are
not
the
only
ways
to
stay
motivated
but
finding
creative
ways
through
improvisation
and
experimentation
can
give
new
perspectives
to
challenging
steps
finally
with
practice
and
dedication
the
beauty
of
dance
can
bring
life
lessons
and
self love
is
an
important
part
of
everyone
s
lives
and
it
should
be
enjoyed
and
appreciated
activity
parks
provide
people
with
an
opportunity
to
connect
with
each
other
and
form
relationships
not
only
do
these
parks
provide
a
physical
space
for
people
to
be
active
play
sports
and
socialise
but
they
can
also
have
profound
psychological
and
social
impacts
people
are
often
more
open
to
talking
to
strangers
in
these
public
spaces
breaking
down
barriers
that
may
exist
elsewhere
regular
visitors
can
form
strong
relationships
through
partaking
in
regular
activities
together
in
many
cases
this
connection
goes
beyond
the
park
itself
providing
people
with
friendships
and
networks
that
can
span
across
geographic
and
cultural
divides
thus
outdoor
activity
parks
serve
as
an
invaluable
space
for
social
and
personal
connection
when
it
comes
to
making
important
decisions
and
navigating
life
s
most
difficult
moments
many
people
turn
to
experts
and
authorities
for
guidance
research
shows
that
making
use
of
advice
from
credible
experts
can
often
lead
to
better
outcomes
questions
and
actively
seek
out
knowledgable
people
who
can
help
provide
support
advice
and
direction
however
it
s
important
to
be
mindful
of
the
difference
between
consulting
an
expert
for
knowledge
and
relying
solely
on
their
judgement
consider
multiple
perspectives
and
their
own
personal
experience
before
making
a
decision
rather
than
relying
solely
on
the
advice
of
one
source
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
relying
on
our
own
knowledge
versus
the
advice
of
experts
to
determine
what
s
best
for
the
situation
when
it
comes
to
understanding
how
and
why
certain
decisions
can
lead
to
bad
consequences
it
s
worth
considering
the
potential
for
violence
or
other
negative
outcomes
it
s
important
to
explore
healthy
strategies
for
communicating
our
thoughts
and
feelings
to
others
so
that
we
can
better
recognize
and
address
conflict
before
it
escalates
and
maintaining
strong
relationships
with
those
around
us
can
help
to
prevent
misunderstandings
and
ensure
that
everyone
involved
is
considerate
and
respectful
of
one
another
by
taking
the
time
to
thoughtfully
assess
difficult
decisions
and
considering
carefully
the
various
input
and
advice
available
to
us
we
can
better
equip
ourselves
to
make
wise
choices
and
find
the
best
path
for
ourselves
understanding
the
impact
of
our
decisions
both
good
and
bad
is
key
to
personal
growth
and
success
after
researching
how
other
school
districts
handle
the
requirements
for
extracurriculars
it
is
clear
that
district
policies
vary
significantly
some
districts
set
low
requirements
in
order
to
open
extracurriculars
to
larger
numbers
of
students
other
districts
set
higher
requirements
in
order
to
ensure
that
students
remain
academically
successful
there
are
benefits
to
each
approach
lower
requirements
open
extracurriculars
to
more
students
enabling
them
to
benefit
from
the
positive
activities
and
social
interactions
these
activities
provide
at
the
same
time
too
low
of
a
requirement
can
be
counterproductive
as
students
may
end
up
focusing
more
on
extracurriculars
than
academics
higher
requirements
provide
an
incentive
to
remain
academically
focused
while
ensuring
only
students
that
are
doing
well
in
school
are
participating
in
extracurriculars
however
setting
such
high
requirements
can
limit
the
number
of
students
who
are
able
to
participate
and
deny
them
the
opportunity
to
benefit
from
extracurriculars
weighing
these
pros
and
cons
it
seems
that
the
school
should
strive
to
keep
its
current
policy
not
too
high
or
too
low
doing
so
allows
the
school
to
maximize
the
benefit
of
extracurriculars
while
still
encouraging
students
to
remain
academically
successful
keeping
such
a
balance
is
important
to
ensure
that
students
have
the
best
educational
experiences
and
are
able
to
make
the
most
of
their
learning
opportunities
when
faced
with
a
difficult
decision
in
life
it
is
often
beneficial
to
ask
for
advice
from
others
receiving
an
outside
opinion
or
perspective
can
help
individuals
make
informed
decisions
and
can
even
result
in
a
higher
success
rate
asking
for
advice
can
also
be
cost effective
when
compared
to
the
possible
costs
of
making
the
wrong
decision
nevertheless
it
is
also
important
to
consider
the
drawbacks
of
not
wanting
or
seeking
advice
from
another
when
in
need
of
assistance
a
lack
of
discussion
means
a
lack
of
different
perspectives
which
can
lead
to
a
less
than
optimal
decision
furthermore
not
asking
for
advice
can
also
be
detrimental
to
helpful
relationships
with
others
in
certain
situations
in
conclusion
while
asking
for
advice
is
not
always
necessary
it
is
a
valuable
tool
with
a
wide
range
of
benefits
to
consider
when
making
life
decisions
it
can
provide
cost
savings
help
provide
a
more
complete
view
of
the
situation
and
even
potentially
raise
success
rate
outcomes
work
offers
several
key
advantages
over
working
on
an
individual
level
for
one
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
students
to
learn
to
appreciate
the
diverse
perspectives
and
expertise
of
their
peers
which
can
be
an
invaluable
asset
in
the
process
of
brainstorming
and
problem
solving
strategies
work
also
provides
a
heightened
level
of
accountability
since
students
are
more
likely
to
take
ownership
of
their
contributions
when
working
with
others
furthermore
the
emphasis
on
respect
and
teamwork
encourages
students
to
develop
interpersonal
skills
and
learn
to
collaborate
effectively
in
order
to
foster
successful
outcomes
additionally
group
work
can
be
an
effective
way
to
divide
up
work
maximize
efficiency
and
help
students
gain
a
better
understanding
of
topics
through
the
process
of
peer
teaching
while
group
work
is
not
without
its
drawbacks
when
facilitated
properly
it
can
be
a
powerful
tool
to
help
students
achieve
academic
success
one
example
of
a
positive
attitude
leading
to
success
is
the
story
of
a
recent
graduate
despite
not
having
a
college
degree
was
determined
to
make
something
of
himself
he
applied
to
dozens
of
jobs
but
was
turned
away
at
each
one
however
he
refused
to
give
up
and
kept
a
positive
attitude
eventually
he
was
hired
as
a
part time
personal
assistant
through
hard
work
and
dedication
he
quickly
made
a
name
for
himself
and
was
promoted
today
he
is
a
successful
entrepreneur
with
his
own
thriving
business
another
example
of
a
positive
attitude
leading
to
success
is
the
story
of
an
aspiring
actress
despite
not
having
much
acting
experience
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
make
it
big
in
the
industry
she
knew
she
did
n t
have
any
connections
and
so
she
put
in
extra
effort
to
prove
herself
she
worked
tirelessly
taking
any
job
that
came
her
way
and
eventually
got
her
big
break
now
has
a
thriving
acting
career
and
has
made
numerous
appearances
on
television
and
film
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
live
every
day
from
improved
communication
capabilities
to
automation
of
mundane
tasks
technology
has
made
life
easier
for
humans
all
over
the
world
one
of
the
most
useful
advancements
in
technology
has
been
communication
we
now
have
instant
messaging
texting
voice
and
video
messaging
and
email
to
keep
in
contact
with
people
all
over
the
world
communication
is
arguably
one
of
the
most
important
elements
in
life
as
it
enables
us
to
interact
with
others
and
stay
connected
without
having
to
be
in
physical
proximity
another
significant
benefit
of
technology
is
the
automation
of
mundane
tasks
technology
allows
us
to
do
things
more
quickly
and
efficiently
making
the
mundane
parts
of
life
much
easier
for
example
online
banking
online
shopping
and
self checkout
in
stores
are
all
examples
of
technology
making
mundane
everyday
tasks
much
easier
even
more
advanced
tasks
like
data
analysis
and
artificial
intelligence
are
becoming
automated
freeing
us
from
hours
of
mundane
work
all
in
all
technology
has
had
an
immensely
positive
impact
on
human
life
it
has
improved
communication
automated
mundane
tasks
and
enabled
us
to
perform
complex
tasks
with
much
less
effort
than
before
technology
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
live
our
lives
with
much
more
ease
and
freedom
and
it
continues
to
open
up
new
possibilities
every
day
in
recent
years
the
debate
about
whether
high
school
should
be
completed
in
three
years
has
been
hotly
contested
proponents
of
shortening
the
high
school
program
argue
that
it
would
offer
both
students
and
parents
much
needed
time
and
financial
savings
despite
the
potential
benefits
there
are
several
potential
issues
that
could
arise
if
all
high
schools
were
to
undertake
this
program
such
as
a
reduced
exposure
to
a
variety
of
course
offerings
placing
students
in
a
position
where
they
are
left
with
limited
options
for
college
preparation
in
addition
to
the
program
changes
credit
and
text
changes
would
need
to
be
implemented
in
order
to
successfully
transition
to
a
three year
program
this
could
include
the
elimination
or
consolidation
of
certain
classes
requiring
faculty
and
administrators
to
work
together
to
balance
the
needs
of
each
student
ultimately
it
is
essential
to
thoroughly
assess
the
potential
benefits
and
disadvantages
of
shortening
the
high
school
program
before
making
this
decision
while
the
idea
of
completing
high
school
in
three
years
may
seem
appealing
in
theory
further
research
is
needed
to
truly
understand
the
implications
of
such
a
change
for
now
it
is
most
beneficial
to
remain
with
the
traditional
four year
high
school
program
is
a
virtue
that
has
been
emphasized
and
celebrated
for
centuries
by
always
choosing
to
be
honest
you
can
enjoy
many
benefits
that
range
from
personal
to
professional
development
on
a
personal
level
being
honest
comes
with
the
reward
of
having
a
clear
conscience
this
means
you
do
n t
have
to
worry
about
remembering
a
lie
or
make
excuses
for
a
truth
that
might
have
been
hard
to
say
in
addition
people
who
are
honest
often
have
a
better
sense
of
self esteem
and
self worth
since
they
know
the
right
thing
to
do
regardless
of
the
consequences
professionally
honesty
is
highly
valued
in
the
workplace
employers
look
for
candidates
who
are
trustworthy
and
have
the
courage
to
stand
by
their
decisions
employees
who
are
honest
are
often
more
reliable
and
well respected
which
can
lead
to
promotions
and
recognition
over
time
it
is
also
easier
to
build
relationships
with
colleagues
when
there
is
mutual
trust
between
all
parties
ultimately
honesty
is
one
of
the
most
important
values
to
uphold
in
both
our
private
and
professional
lives
being
honest
and
true
to
oneself
can
open
many
doors
and
provide
lasting
rewards
when
we
make
the
commitment
to
be
honest
our
lives
will
inevitably
become
better
and
more
enriching
first
impressions
of
others
can
be
heavily
influenced
by
differences
in
personality
situation
and
representation
factors
such
as
the
way
one
dresses
their
level
of
confidence
or
the
context
of
their
introduction
can
shape
our
initial
perception
of
them
for
example
meeting
someone
in
an
upscale
restaurant
surrounded
by
affluent
peers
can
create
a
certain
impression
that
may
not
be
reflective
of
who
they
are
the
same
can
be
said
if
someone
is
dressed
in
low cost
clothing
or
is
seen
in
a
less
than
desirable
environment
in
certain
situations
someone
who
is
naturally
quiet
may
be
seen
as
shy
and
unapproachable
whereas
in
another
context
they
may
be
interpreted
as
being
serious
and
logical
representation
also
weighs
heavily
on
our
opinion
of
others
someone
who
is
seen
as
being
attractive
and
stylish
for
instance
may
seem
fun
and
outgoing
while
someone
who
is
seen
as
less
attractive
may
be
seen
as
uninteresting
or
dull
this
is
an
unjustified
first
impression
as
we
can
never
truly
know
someone
merely
from
sight
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
of
factors
that
can
shape
our
initial
opinion
of
others
before
we
form
assumptions
that
may
not
be
true
in
summary
first
impressions
of
others
can
often
be
inaccurate
due
to
personality
situation
and
representation
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
context
and
other
factors
before
forming
an
opinion
of
someone
so
that
one
can
strive
to
be
more
mindful
of
the
assumptions
they
make
joining
a
homework
help
club
at
school
can
be
a
great
way
for
students
to
access
assistance
with
their
studies
it
can
be
particularly
useful
for
students
who
do
n t
have
access
to
tutoring
and
may
be
struggling
with
a
specific
subject
however
there
are
a
few
potential
issues
that
students
may
have
in
joining
the
club
firstly
the
student
may
be
hesitant
or
uncomfortable
about
asking
for
help
as
this
could
be
seen
as
an
admission
of
weakness
or
inability
some
students
may
not
have
the
time
to
attend
the
club
s
regular
meetings
due
to
other
school
or
extracurricular
commitments
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
potential
benefits
of
a
homework
help
club
through
the
club
students
can
get
access
to
help
from
knowledgeable
tutors
who
can
help
them
to
understand
complicated
concepts
members
of
the
club
can
collaborate
and
discuss
difficult
topics
leading
to
better
understanding
and
better
performances
in
school
joining
a
homework
help
club
can
also
improve
student
s
motivation
and
interest
in
studying
as
well
as
helping
them
to
build
relationships
with
their
peers
extracurricular
activities
form
an
important
part
of
a
student
s
school
experience
these
activities
range
from
team
sports
clubs
and
volunteer
opportunities
to
art
classes
singing
or
involvement
in
school
events
although
there
is
a
multitude
of
reasons
why
students
should
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
three
stand
out
safety
health
and
fun
is
a
big
reason
why
students
should
partake
in
extracurricular
activities
taking
part
in
team
sports
for
instance
can
give
young
people
an
outlet
for
their
energy
away
from
potentially
dangerous
and
reckless
behaviors
joining
clubs
or
volunteering
also
helps
keep
students
out
of
trouble
by
giving
them
positive
outlets
for
their
time
extracurricular
activities
also
help
keep
students
healthy
participating
in
sports
or
physical
activity
not
only
can
improve
physical
fitness
but
also
mental
wellness
staying
physically
active
is
beneficial
for
the
mind
releasing
endorphins
and
reducing
stress
additionally
joining
student
clubs
and
conducting
group
activities
helps
students
stay
social
and
establish
relationships
with
peers
lastly
extracurricular
activities
are
simply
fun
being
part
of
a
sports
team
gives
student
a
sense
of
camaraderie
while
joining
a
club
sparks
a
sense
of
belonging
participating
in
activities
outside
of
the
classroom
is
a
great
way
to
progress
as
an
individual
make
friends
and
most
of
all
have
a
good
time
to
sum
up
there
are
many
reasons
why
students
should
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
from
keeping
them
out
of
trouble
and
promoting
physical
and
mental
health
to
providing
them
an
entertaining
and
fun
experience
there
are
countless
benefits
to
getting
involved
in
school
activities
it
is
important
to
understand
that
it
is
not
beneficial
to
pair
older
kids
with
younger
kids
to
begin
it
can
be
a
dangerous
situation
for
younger
kids
due
to
an
unfair
physical
advantage
an
older
child
may
use
this
physical
advantage
to
bully
or
harm
a
younger
child
or
put
them
in
dangerous
situations
without
fully
understanding
the
consequences
secondly
an
older
child
may
provide
a
negative
example
to
the
younger
child
older
kids
may
influence
a
younger
child
to
participate
in
activities
or
make
decisions
that
can
have
long term
effects
lastly
older
kids
should
respect
younger
kids
and
not
view
them
as
inferior
or
expendable
they
should
be
seen
as
peers
in
terms
of
respect
and
value
for
example
an
older
kid
should
not
spread
rumors
or
gossip
about
a
younger
child
as
this
can
lead
to
ostracism
and
other
negative
effects
considering
the
potential
dangers
and
the
need
for
respect
it
is
essential
that
older
kids
not
be
paired
with
younger
kids
in
recent
years
educational
institutions
have
been
striving
to
make
schools
more
equitable
by
providing
resources
and
opportunities
to
all
students
regardless
of
their
grade
average
allowing
students
of
all
grades
to
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
would
be
a
major
step
in
achieving
this
goal
and
this
initiative
would
be
beneficial
to
the
entire
school
population
for
several
reasons
to
begin
with
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
help
build
character
participation
teaches
students
important
skills
such
as
collaboration
respect
and
perseverance
all
of
which
are
vital
for
success
in
any
aspect
of
life
additionally
these
activities
provide
an
outlet
for
creativity
and
expression
giving
students
a
chance
to
experiment
with
different
hobbies
and
interests
in
a
safe
and
structured
environment
allowing
different
grade
averages
to
participate
together
in
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
would
give
them
the
opportunity
to
develop
better
relationships
and
understanding
of
each
other
by
having
different
grades
working
together
younger
students
can
look
up
to
older
ones
while
older
students
benefit
from
mentoring
younger
students
and
can
learn
from
their
enthusiasm
and
excitement
for
these
reasons
i
strongly
believe
that
we
should
permit
students
of
all
grade
levels
to
participate
in
sports
and
extracurricular
activities
doing
so
will
help
our
school
population
develop
well rounded
characters
increase
levels
of
understanding
between
different
grades
and
help
create
a
more
equitable
environment
for
everyone
involved
people
often
take
advice
from
their
family
members
in
order
to
shape
their
character
the
family
can
become
a
primary
source
of
positive
influence
during
a
person
s
formative
years
providing
an
important
framework
for
building
important
character
traits
such
as
compassion
communication
dependability
honesty
and
self confidence
though
a
family
can
be
invaluable
in
developing
a
strong
set
of
moral
values
it
is
important
to
remember
that
individuals
must
ultimately
take
ownership
of
their
own
character
our
character
is
shaped
not
only
by
the
advice
we
take
from
those
around
us
but
also
from
those
we
interact
with
on
a
day
to
day
basis
from
our
fellow
students
to
our
co workers
everyone
has
an
impact
on
our
character
having
a
bad
character
can
have
serious
consequences
it
can
lead
to
broken
relationships
blocks
on
professional
advancement
and
loopholes
in
our
moral
compass
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
various
influences
on
our
character
and
to
take
ownership
of
our
own
thoughts
and
values
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
balance
between
taking
advice
from
those
around
us
in
order
to
improve
our
character
while
at
the
same
time
not
allowing
the
opinions
of
others
to
override
our
own
ultimately
it
is
through
our
own
choices
that
we
form
our
individual
character
traits
and
values
when
it
comes
to
accomplishing
a
task
there
are
certain
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
working
alone
and
working
with
a
group
working
alone
often
offers
more
control
over
the
project
and
less
distraction
putting
the
individual
in
a
more
focused
and
creative
environment
however
working
alone
can
also
lead
to
anxiety
and
the
feeling
of
being
overwhelmed
on
the
other
hand
working
with
a
group
can
bring
fresh
ideas
and
perspectives
creating
a
more
collaborative
innovative
environment
but
there
is
a
potential
for
conflict
and
confusion
with
increased
input
from
others
overall
both
working
alone
and
working
with
a
group
have
their
own
pros
and
cons
ultimately
the
best
option
should
depend
on
the
particular
task
and
what
resources
are
available
if
individual
creativity
and
autonomy
is
important
then
working
alone
might
be
the
most
effective
route
but
if
collaboration
and
brainstorming
is
needed
then
working
with
a
group
is
likely
the
better
option

and
make
decisions
knowing
that
they
are
based
on
sound
advice
that

lead
to
a

a
recent
study
has
shown
that
students
who
engage
in
extracurricular
activities
such
as
sports
clubs
or
volunteer
organizations
can
benefit
from
an
enhanced
educational
experience
those
who
take
part
in
extracurricular
activities
tend
to
have
higher
grades
better
attendance
at
school
and
higher
rates
of
college
acceptance
in
fact
of
students
who
heavily
participate
in
extracurricular
activities
report
feeling
more
connected
to
their
school
community
versus
only
of
students
who
do
not
participate
in
activities
on
the
other
hand
students
who
involve
themselves
in
too
many
extracurricular
activities
can
put
their
education
at
risk
they
may
end
up
missing
classes
having
lower
grades
or
even
experiencing
emotional
burnout
to
avoid
these
problems
it
is
important
for
students
to
prioritize
their
extracurricular
activities
and
find
balance
between
their
educational
commitments
and
their
involvement
with
clubs
and
organizations
the
debate
between
lengthening
the
school
day
and
maintaining
current
parameters
is
an
ongoing
discussion
among
school
boards
and
educators
alike
introducing
an
extra
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
may
potentially
benefit
both
student
performance
and
academic
achievement
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
drawbacks
particularly
when
looking
at
its
effect
on
student
physical
and
mental
health
family
dynamics
and
student
morale
students
physical
and
mental
well being
is
often
at
the
forefront
of
the
discussion
when
altering
educational
measures
an
additional
minutes
every
school
day
could
lead
to
stress
among
students
especially
those
who
are
already
struggling
to
keep
up
the
extra
time
could
also
exacerbate
issues
with
fatigue
and
insomnia
dynamics
could
also
be
negatively
impacted
if
parents
are
suddenly
left
scrambling
to
find
new
ways
of
caring
for
their
children
during
the
extended
school
day
additionally
student
morale
may
suffer
due
to
the
additional
study
time
resulting
in
further
stress
and
decreased
satisfaction
with
schooling
in
conclusion
the
school
board
should
take
into
account
all
the
factors
outlined
above
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
whether
to
add
one
and
a
half
hour
to
the
school
day
while
such
an
action
may
prove
beneficial
for
some
students
it
is
essential
to
consider
the
impact
that
it
could
have
on
students
physical
and
mental
well being
family
dynamics
and
student
morale
when
making
decisions
in
life
it
is
important
to
listen
to
both
your
heart
and
your
mind
your
heart
represents
your
emotions
and
intuition
while
your
mind
contains
your
more
logical
side
there
will
often
be
times
when
your
heart
and
your
mind
will
provide
conflicting
advice
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
know
which
advice
to
follow
in
these
cases
it
can
help
to
take
a
moment
to
consider
which
advice
is
best
for
your
overall
goals
and
long term
success
no
matter
what
decisions
you
make
you
will
likely
face
some
type
of
negativity
from
those
around
you
even
with
the
best
intentions
and
plans
it
is
impossible
to
please
everyone
during
these
moments
it
is
important
to
stay
focused
on
your
goals
and
maintain
your
motivation
do
what
feels
right
to
you
and
stay
true
to
yourself
do
n t
let
the
opinions
of
others
dull
your
spark
and
keep
striving
for
success
in
all
that
you
do
in
a
world
increasingly
driven
by
conformity
it
can
be
difficult
to
stay
true
to
oneself
we
are
constantly
bombarded
by
societal
pressures
to
fit
in
and
many
of
us
feel
obligated
to
obey
the
norms
set
by
powerful
mainstream
entities
however
there
is
an
underlying
importance
to
individuality
which
can
not
be
overstated
especially
in
modern
society
despite
the
temptation
to
follow
the
crowd
standing
out
and
embracing
one
s
unique
identity
can
often
lead
to
greater
success
it
is
necessary
to
consider
s
perspective
on
being
an
individual
when
discussing
this
issue
according
to
fitting
in
is
a
detrimental
force
which
seeks
to
suppress
individuality
and
he
argues
that
we
should
instead
strive
to
stand
out
and
honor
our
individual
selves
while
this
philosophy
certainly
provides
an
admirable
model
for
personal
development
it
is
important
to
remember
that
individual
expression
in
modern
society
is
not
as
easily
facilitated
as
it
may
have
been
in
s
era
with
the
advent
of
new
forms
of
media
and
constant
bombardment
of
constructed
ideals
it
can
often
be
more
difficult
for
an
individual
to
break
through
the
noise
and
gain
recognition
for
their
talents
ultimately
it
is
important
to
remember
that
there
is
still
value
in
individuality
regardless
of
the
obstacles
that
may
stand
in
the
way
it
is
paramount
to
remember
that
while
conformity
is
often
rewarded
in
the
short term
being
one
s
authentic
self
can
often
lead
to
longer term
success
thus
despite
the
temptation
to
conform
it
is
important
to
consider
the
positive
influence
individual
expression
can
have
on
one
s
life
and
career
taking
the
opportunity
to
learn
new
things
might
be
intimidating
at
first
it
requires
us
to
open
ourselves
up
to
the
unfamiliar
and
break
away
from
what
we
already
know
however
it
can
be
highly
beneficial
in
both
our
academic
and
personal
development
for
example
having
a
plan
can
assist
us
in
expanding
our
options
and
skillsets
this
can
be
especially
useful
when
we
find
that
certain
programs
we
wish
to
pursue
are
no
longer
available
additionally
there
are
opportunities
to
explore
topics
we
may
not
initially
be
interested
in
but
can
discover
new
hobbies
and
passions
in
my
own
experience
i
have
found
the
opportunity
to
focus
on
new
topics
has
enabled
me
to
challenge
and
broaden
my
knowledge
in
a
creative
way
being
open
to
trying
new
activities
and
topics
has
allowed
me
to
develop
skills
and
form
relationships
with
people
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
otherwise
moving
forward
i
plan
to
take
any
opportunity
that
arises
for
me
to
learn
something
new
and
to
push
myself
out
of
my
comfort
zone
gaining
success
in
life
requires
dedication
resilience
and
the
right
motivation
and
the
brothers
provide
inspirational
examples
of
individuals
who
pushed
themselves
beyond
their
goals
in
order
to
obtain
success
gates
utilized
his
knowledge
of
programming
and
secured
a
leading
position
in
the
software
industry
while
the
brothers
created
an
empire
from
overhauling
and
selling
cars
both
of
these
successes
illustrate
the
impact
of
genuine
motivation
which
is
key
to
achieving
goals
in
life
having
the
wrong
motivation
can
lead
to
failure
as
articulated
by
taken
for
selfish
or
misguided
reasons
can
backfire
thereby
stifling
growth
and
progress
being
committed
to
success
requires
understanding
what
truly
motivates
and
drives
one
s
actions
people
who
recognize
and
leverage
the
right
motivations
often
find
that
they
are
more
likely
to
meet
their
goals
and
achieve
success
when
it
comes
to
working
in
a
group
versus
working
alone
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
consider
working
in
a
group
can
provide
a
great
opportunity
for
collaboration
as
multiple
individuals
come
together
to
brainstorm
ideas
openly
discuss
different
options
and
share
their
unique
perspectives
this
makes
it
possible
to
generate
more
creative
and
innovative
solutions
to
tackle
challenging
projects
additionally
working
in
a
group
can
reduce
stress
for
the
members
as
it
ensures
everyone
has
accountability
and
support
from
one
another
along
the
way
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
also
has
its
perks
it
allows
for
uninterrupted
concentration
uninterrupted
focus
and
no
distractions
from
direct
collaboration
with
other
people
this
is
important
for
those
moments
when
deep
and
vigorous
contemplation
is
needed
to
solve
complex
or
unique
problems
furthermore
it
gives
the
individual
the
flexibility
and
autonomy
to
prioritize
tasks
and
manage
their
own
pacing
ultimately
whether
you
decide
to
work
in
a
group
or
alone
depends
on
the
task
at
hand
and
the
individual
s
preferences
both
methods
can
benefit
productivity
and
high quality
results
if
they
are
approached
and
executed
effectively
i
strongly
disagree
with
former
british
s
idea
that
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
while
it
is
true
that
motivation
and
determination
are
key
components
in
the
success
of
any
endeavor
too
often
going
from
one
failure
to
the
next
without
reflection
and
assessment
can
do
more
harm
than
good
i
have
found
that
in
many
situations
reflecting
on
each
failure
has
been
a
more
beneficial
long term
strategy
for
success
than
continuously
ploughing
forward
without
checking
for
possible
pitfalls
my
own
experience
with
a
high stakes
business
project
in
university
demonstrated
this
perfectly
after
a
number
of
failed
attempts
to
complete
the
project
taking
a
step
back
allowed
me
to
identify
the
main
source
of
the
failures
and
develop
strategies
to
avoid
them
in
the
end
pause
and
reflection
saved
both
time
and
effort
enabling
us
to
apply
effective
approaches
that
ultimately
led
us
to
success
therefore
while
enthusiasm
and
dedication
are
invaluable
assets
in
any
pursuit
consciously
reflecting
and
responding
to
each
failure
is
a
vital
component
in
achieving
a
meaningful
and
lasting
success
despite
growing
concern
of
student
debt
students
still
have
the
right
to
pursue
any
career
they
deem
fit
while
working
in
college
can
offer
financial
relief
this
should
not
be
the
only
reason
all
students
should
be
aware
of
the
value
of
work
experience
and
should
seek
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
make
the
most
of
their
time
and
effort
in
any
job
they
secure
before
committing
to
any
job
students
should
consider
the
following
factors
are
they
interested
in
this
job
will
it
offer
them
the
experience
they
need
how
will
the
job
benefit
them
in
the
long
run
education
should
also
be
a
factor
as
certain
jobs
may
require
more
training
and
qualifications
than
others
lastly
student
should
take
their
parents
advice
on
their
career
journey
into
account
parents
have
attained
their
wealth
of
knowledge
through
life
experiences
and
their
advice
can
help
students
to
make
better
informed
decisions
on
their
first
steps
ultimately
the
right
to
continue
our
education
or
choose
a
career
should
be
balanced
with
the
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
career
path
pursued
helps
us
to
develop
our
skills
and
provides
us
with
meaningful
experiences
working
in
college
and
making
the
most
out
of
these
opportunities
has
the
potential
to
open
more
doors
to
further
career
advancements
enabling
students
to
become
independent
in
this
way
we
all
have
the
right
to
make
our
own
decisions
regarding
our
future
and
strive
towards
success
in
any
way
we
can
break
is
a
common
and
much
anticipated
time
for
students
but
it
could
also
have
its
drawbacks
on
the
one
hand
a
long
break
can
provide
students
with
the
opportunity
to
review
the
material
they
learned
during
the
school
year
and
even
take
summer
school
classes
to
make
up
any
credits
they
need
additionally
students
often
get
to
spend
more
quality
time
with
their
families
during
this
break
on
the
other
hand
students
who
have
difficulty
with
learning
may
struggle
more
without
the
regular
schedule
of
school
and
find
it
difficult
to
continue
learning
during
their
own
time
additionally
lots
of
idle
time
during
the
summer
may
lead
to
students
forgetting
much
of
what
they
studied
the
previous
year
due
to
lack
of
practice
an
alternative
option
to
a
long
summer
break
would
be
to
attend
year round
school
which
would
provide
students
with
a
more
consistent
learning
environment
and
prevent
knowledge
from
fading
over
time
ultimately
it
s
up
to
each
student
and
their
families
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
different
options
and
decide
what
solution
best
fits
their
particular
needs
and
situation
when
it
comes
to
providing
effective
praise
for
deficient
work
it
s
important
to
remember
that
true
self esteem
comes
from
achievement
rather
than
solely
from
praises
to
promote
a
student
s
self confidence
it
is
important
to
focus
not
only
on
what
proficiency
they
have
but
also
to
provide
helpful
ideas
tips
and
reasons
on
how
to
improve
their
proficiency
additionally
setting
high
expectations
and
holding
students
to
a
certain
degree
of
accountability
is
often
useful
in
helping
them
commit
to
their
tasks
and
become
stronger
keeping
the
focus
on
providing
constructive
feedback
and
constructive
criticisms
to
the
student
rather
than
simply
disciplinary
reprimands
can
be
effective
in
helping
them
improve
their
confidence
and
build
self esteem
character
is
often
said
to
define
who
we
are
as
individuals
but
should
we
choose
these
traits
for
ourselves
or
be
shaped
and
molded
by
outside
forces
there
is
much
debate
surrounding
this
issue
and
it
is
important
to
consider
both
sides
before
making
a
decision
on
the
one
hand
there
are
those
who
believe
that
character
traits
should
be
chosen
independently
self determination
allows
us
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
makes
us
agents
of
change
in
our
own
lives
moreover
it
also
allows
us
to
establish
our
values
and
follow
our
own
moral
compass
by
taking
this
approach
we
can
be
assured
that
our
character
is
shaped
by
the
person
we
decide
to
be
an
example
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
way
people
choose
to
use
their
resources
in
different
ways
to
achieve
certain
goals
on
the
other
hand
it
is
argued
that
character
traits
should
be
shaped
in
part
by
outside
influences
external
experiences
both
good
and
bad
can
shape
and
influence
our
character
culture
family
and
other
external
influences
can
all
contribute
to
our
values
and
way
of
life
proponents
of
this
approach
argue
that
these
experiences
are
necessary
in
order
to
help
shape
and
refine
our
character
an
example
of
this
is
how
people
from
different
cultures
have
varying
perspectives
on
certain
issues
ultimately
it
is
up
to
us
to
decide
how
our
character
is
shaped
and
molded
we
have
the
freedom
of
choice
and
the
power
to
change
the
course
of
our
lives
we
can
support
positive
external
influences
while
maintaining
our
own
autonomy
and
individuality
as
long
as
we
make
conscious
decisions
about
our
character
traits
we
can
shape
our
lives
in
a
way
that
is
best
for
us
in
conclusion
when
it
comes
to
our
character
traits
we
have
the
power
to
determine
our
own
destiny
we
can
draw
from
the
values
of
those
that
have
influenced
us
or
we
can
create
our
own
unique
character
and
determine
our
own
fate
it
is
up
to
us
to
decide
which
approach
is
best
for
our
lives
and
we
have
the
freedom
to
choose
our
own
character
traits
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
determine
their
ideal
career
path
and
it
is
natural
to
feel
uncertain
about
the
future
family
members
can
often
be
a
great
source
of
support
but
they
may
also
unintentionally
pressure
students
to
pursue
a
certain
career
option
on
one
hand
some
might
argue
that
it
is
beneficial
for
students
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
their
dream
job
from
an
early
age
and
dedicate
their
time
and
energy
to
achieving
it
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
advantages
to
exploring
the
different
options
and
allowing
oneself
to
grow
while
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
answer
the
reality
is
that
students
should
make
the
decision
that
feels
right
for
them
it
is
important
to
consider
both
perspectives
and
to
also
take
the
time
to
understand
and
explore
the
range
of
possibilities
available
to
them
there
are
numerous
resources
and
professionals
available
to
help
students
make
an
informed
decision
about
their
future
and
should
be
utilized
to
the
fullest
ultimately
the
responsibility
of
choosing
a
career
falls
on
the
individual
and
they
should
trust
their
instincts
and
make
the
decision
that
feels
right
for
them
once
said
what
lies
behind
us
and
what
lies
before
us
are
tiny
matters
compared
to
what
lies
within
us
this
quote
offers
insight
into
s
view
on
exploring
the
world
around
us
and
using
our
skills
to
challenge
ourselves
by
engaging
in
activities
that
push
us
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
we
are
able
to
learn
experience
and
gain
knowledge
that
is
valuable
for
our
future
the
benefits
of
taking
risks
and
tackling
new
tasks
far
outweigh
the
comfort
of
staying
idle
in
life
by
embracing
new
experiences
we
can
hone
in
on
our
curiosity
and
gain
confidence
in
our
abilities
we
can
develop
skills
that
can
shape
a
brighter
future
for
ourselves
and
the
world
around
us
on
the
other
hand
not
challenging
ourselves
or
attempting
to
master
something
can
have
serious
consequences
without
a
sense
of
leadership
creativity
and
initiative
advancement
can
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
in
order
to
successfully
challenge
ourselves
and
push
the
limits
of
our
capabilities
we
must
understand
the
risks
and
rewards
of
taking
on
new
tasks
by
outlining
our
own
goals
and
objectives
we
can
measure
our
own
progress
and
determine
if
the
challenge
was
worth
our
time
ultimately
with
determination
and
dedication
anyone
can
take
on
new
tasks
and
experience
a
deeper
understanding
of
their
potential
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
remember
how
indescribable
it
felt
to
have
a
guidance
counselor
who
was
genuinely
interested
in
my
success
and
well being
with
their
help
and
guidance
i
felt
like
i
had
a
mentor
who
could
help
me
take
my
next
steps
it
even
helped
me
feel
supported
during
the
challenging
transition
to
college
that
experience
planted
a
seed
in
me
that
i
would
one
day
like
to
become
a
guidance
counselor
and
help
other
students
the
same
way
my
guidance
counselor
helped
me
i
believe
that
as
a
guidance
counselor
i
bring
a
balanced
combination
of
empathy
and
knowledge
in
addition
to
having
my
own
personal
experience
of
being
in
the
students
shoes
that
will
enable
me
to
be
an
effective
mentor
for
my
students
my
primary
goal
is
to
support
and
empower
students
to
reach
their
true
potential
and
open
as
many
opportunities
as
possible
i
am
committed
to
connecting
them
with
resources
offering
advice
and
helping
them
access
the
educational
and
career
paths
that
fit
them
best
it
is
essential
to
seek
help
from
a
guidance
counselor
support
from
outside
is
invaluable
and
provides
a
different
perspective
counselors
work
hard
to
get
to
know
each
student
personally
and
offer
individual
and
tailored
advice
through
collaborations
between
teachers
family
members
and
friends
guidance
counselors
can
be
a
bridge
to
an
overall
sense
of
stability
and
direction
my
passion
and
dedication
to
helping
students
make
successful
life
decisions
is
why
i
want
to
become
a
guidance
counselor
i
believe
that
with
the
right
help
students
can
grow
and
develop
into
their
best
versions
and
ultimately
have
successful
lives
after
school
clubs
provide
students
with
a
unique
opportunity
to
explore
their
interests
and
gain
extra
help
in
their
studies
in
an
informal
setting
by
involving
teachers
they
can
help
to
bridge
the
gap
between
the
students
and
the
schools
providing
one on one
support
for
students
who
may
be
struggling
participating
in
after
school
clubs
can
also
help
to
give
students
the
self confidence
and
motivation
needed
to
perform
better
in
their
studies
furthermore
it
can
give
them
the
chance
to
develop
long term
relationships
with
their
peers
and
teachers
leading
to
increased
engagement
with
their
schoolwork
the
after
school
club
environment
promotes
a
positive
atmosphere
and
gives
students
the
opportunity
to
practice
their
leadership
and
organizational
skills
with
everyone
working
toward
the
goal
of
improving
student
achievement
the
after
school
club
experience
can
be
beneficial
and
rewarding
for
all
involved
it
is
no
small
feat
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
where
conformity
is
rewarded
and
individuality
is
often
frowned
upon
to
love
and
value
yourself
is
particularly
important
in
light
of
this
situation
as
it
enables
you
to
bravely
strive
for
your
goals
and
take
risks
courage
is
essential
in
accomplishing
any
activity
which
makes
it
a
key
component
of
the
greatest
accomplishment
of
all
being
yourself
your
parents
and
teachers
have
likely
reminded
you
on
many
occasions
throughout
your
life
to
embrace
yourself
and
all
that
comes
with
it
they
know
that
self love
and
accomplishment
are
intertwined
and
that
accomplishments
can
provide
a
stepping
stone
toward
a
positive
future
this
is
something
as
simple
as
a
schoolteacher
reminding
you
to
be
proud
of
yourself
for
trying
your
best
on
a
project
or
a
parent
telling
you
that
they
re
proud
of
the
way
you
handled
a
problem
these
statements
may
seem
small
at
the
time
but
they
embody
an
important
truth
about
loving
yourself
your
accomplishments
shape
your
future
the
importance
of
loving
and
valuing
yourself
and
your
accomplishments
can
not
be
overstated
without
self love
and
courage
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
most
of
our
talents
and
achieve
our
dreams
loving
and
valuing
yourself
provides
the
courage
to
put
yourself
out
there
and
take
risks
which
in
turn
helps
create
great
accomplishments
that
will
shape
your
future

phones
have
become
essential
tools
for
students
in
the
modern
era
providing
a
constant
connection
to
others
as
well
as
access
to
information
as
such
many
schools
have
implemented
policies
aimed
at
managing
mobile
phone
use
among
their
student
body
however
there
are
two
distinct
approaches
to
mobile
phone
policies
in
a
school
setting
namely
a
strict ban
policy
and
a
moderate use
policy
the
strict ban
policy
eliminates
the
presence
of
mobile
phones
in
the
school
by
prohibiting
their
use
entirely
adopting
such
a
policy
can
reduce
potential
distractions
that
might
occur
during
class
time
including
microphones
being
turned
on
or
the
use
of
social
media
during
lessons
additionally
students
without
mobile
phones
may
be
less
prone
to
cyberbullying
or
unwanted
contact
from
external
sources
creating
a
safe
and
secure
learning
environment
for
everyone
on
the
other
hand
the
moderate use
policy
allows
for
student
use
of
mobile
phones
in
a
restricted
and
supervised
manner
in
this
scenario
students
are
allowed
to
bring
their
phones
to
school
but
are
only
allowed
to
use
them
during
designated
periods
or
in
specific
areas
for
example
a
student
might
be
allowed
to
use
their
phone
during
free time
in
their
break
or
recess
period
a
moderate use
policy
also
allows
for
the
use
of
mobile
devices
for
educational
purposes
such
as
for
researching
or
downloading
educational
resources
which
can
have
positive
outcomes
in
terms
of
learning
outcomes
in
conclusion
implementing
a
strict ban
or
moderate use
policy
for
mobile
phones
in
a
school
setting
will
have
its
own
unique
advantages
and
disadvantages
must
weigh
these
pros
and
cons
carefully
before
making
a
decision
on
the
best
policy
for
their
students
making
mistakes
and
failure
are
unavoidable
principal
components
of
success
famously
stated
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
this
quote
serves
to
remind
us
that
failure
is
actually
a
prime
part
of
the
recipe
for
success
after
making
a
blunder
it
is
essential
to
remain
in
good
spirits
and
use
the
mistake
to
induce
positive
growth
s
advice
is
sound
and
provides
insight
into
how
to
live
a
successful
life
and
failure
are
inescapable
and
embracing
these
components
can
lead
to
a
successful
outcome
extended
school
hours
would
not
be
in
the
best
interest
of
students
forcing
additional
hours
of
attendance
can
lead
to
students
not
paying
attention
in
class
feeling
resentful
towards
teachers
and
can
even
cause
an
uprising
among
students
this
extended
time
can
really
be
put
to
better
use
by
making
these
extra
hours
to
be
an
optional
after school
activity
this
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
life
and
the
school
that
they
are
attending
learning
outside
of
the
classroom
can
also
be
more
engaging
for
the
students
since
the
topics
that
they
are
already
studying
can
be
explored
more
in depth
curfews
and
the
associated
restrictions
can
play
a
valuable
role
in
helping
teenagers
stay
out
of
trouble
being
out
at
night
can
be
hazardous
and
curfews
help
to
keep
teens
at
home
or
in
a
safe
place
in
addition
curfews
give
teenagers
extra
time
to
focus
on
activities
that
bring
them
closer
to
family
and
friends
teens
can
use
the
extra
hours
to
build
stronger
relationships
with
their
parents
and
siblings
or
to
work
on
projects
in
school
or
in
the
community
with
the
time
provided
by
curfews
teens
can
take
note
of
their
responsibilities
and
develop
into
responsible
young
adults
ultimately
curfews
can
be
effective
in
curbing
teenage
activities
that
could
lead
to
trouble
it
is
true
that
there
are
some
advantages
to
pursuing
a
career
at
a
young
age
for
example
young
people
are
often
full
of
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
they
can
take
on
tasks
with
a
great
deal
of
vigor
and
determination
also
starting
out
a
career
at
a
young
age
can
provide
a
foundation
for
future
success
however
there
are
also
some
potential
drawbacks
to
starting
work
at
a
young
age
for
instance
young
people
may
lack
the
experience
and
critical
thinking
skills
that
come
with
age
making
it
difficult
for
them
to
effectively
plan
ahead
and
make
connections
in
addition
adolescents
can
often
be
easily
taken
advantage
of
by
those
with
more
experience
in
the
workforce
making
it
difficult
for
them
to
make
the
best
career
decisions
for
themselves
overall
i
believe
it
is
not
always
necessary
for
students
to
start
a
career
as
teenagers
instead
young
people
should
seek
to
find
balance
between
pursuing
their
interests
and
furthering
their
education
in
order
to
be
prepared
for
their
eventual
career
it
is
important
for
teenagers
to
take
the
time
to
explore
their
individual
goals
and
get
the
most
out
of
their
high
school
experience
before
taking
on
the
responsibility
of
a
job
break
is
an
ideal
time
for
students
to
engage
in
educational
activities
independently
while
there
are
plenty
of
teacher created
summer
projects
available
for
students
to
complete
student created
summer
projects
can
also
provide
an
engaging
creative
learning
experience
through
research
two
teacher designed
summer
projects
and
two
student designed
projects
were
selected
to
compare
and
contrast
in
this
essay
one
of
the
teacher designed
summer
projects
is
to
recreate
a
historic
event
using
different
types
of
media
for
example
students
can
create
a
poster
a
video
and
a
research
paper
with
facts
and
figures
the
second
teacher designed
summer
project
would
be
the
construction
of
a
model
of
the
human
body
this
requires
students
to
research
the
anatomy
of
the
human
body
as
well
as
use
their
problem
solving
and
motor
skills
to
assemble
the
model
moving
on
to
the
student designed
summer
projects
one
such
project
would
be
creating
an
interactive
poster
this
requires
students
to
think
creatively
in
order
to
come
up
with
interesting
and
unique
ways
to
relay
information
on
a
poster
the
second
project
is
to
design
an
app
this
project
allows
students
to
learn
the
basics
of
coding
as
they
design
the
app
and
allows
for
deeper
thinking
in
navigation
and
layout
lastly
an
example
of
a
creative
student designed
summer
project
is
to
create
a
role playing
game
during
this
project
students
can
develop
characters
storylines
and
a
game
plan
students
will
also
need
to
do
research
in
order
to
learn
how
to
construct
the
game
this
essay
outlines
the
comparison
and
contrast
between
teacher designed
and
student designed
summer
projects
after
doing
research
on
four
summer
projects
a
creative
student designed
project
was
created
to
illustrate
the
possibilities
that
come
with
student designed
projects
break
is
a
great
opportunity
for
students
to
engage
in
educational
activities
and
student created
projects
can
help
make
learning
more
creative
and
engaging
making
good
decisions
can
be
difficult
but
by
following
the
right
steps
it
can
be
made
much
easier
a
good
approach
to
making
good
decisions
starts
with
researching
to
determine
the
appropriate
course
of
action
after
that
it
is
important
to
identify
a
few
trusted
adults
who
can
be
counted
on
to
give
sound
advice
once
identified
ask
each
of
these
adults
for
their
opinion
on
the
decision
that
needs
to
be
made
then
be
sure
to
listen
carefully
to
what
your
parents
and
other
adults
have
to
say
ultimately
make
sure
to
use
your
own
judgment
and
think
critically
about
the
opinions
given
to
you
consider
whether
the
advice
is
in
your
best
interest
and
the
best
course
of
action
for
the
situation
ultimately
this
approach
will
help
you
make
the
best
decision
for
you
in
any
given
situation
having
a
positive
attitude
in
life
can
have
an
immense
impact
on
our
success
and
overall
well being
those
with
a
positive
outlook
are
more
likely
to
take
risks
and
persevere
through
difficult
circumstances
leading
to
greater
success
additionally
those
with
a
positive
attitude
often
inspire
and
motivate
those
around
them
creating
a
virtuous
cycle
of
positivity
that
can
lead
to
even
more
success
the
implications
of
having
a
negative
attitude
as
opposed
to
a
positive
one
are
dire
those
with
a
pessimistic
outlook
are
more
likely
to
give
up
and
rarely
achieve
great
heights
furthermore
negative
attitudes
can
spread
leading
to
others
in
the
same
environment
feeling
disheartened
and
possibly
discouraged
from
attempting
to
reach
their
goals
ultimately
it
is
important
for
each
of
us
to
maintain
a
positive
outlook
in
life
as
it
allows
us
to
accomplish
more
and
bring
joy
to
those
around
us
the
warm
sun
on
my
skin
and
the
sounds
of
nature
around
me
was
refreshing
i
was
so
excited
for
this
outdoor
adventure
with
my
friends
we
decided
to
take
a
bike
ride
around
town
and
see
the
sights
as
we
rode
we
talked
about
our
goals
and
accomplishments
and
made
jokes
about
the
days
we
d
had
we
stopped
by
the
local
park
and
sat
at
the
picnic
tables
snacking
on
snacks
and
taking
in
the
fresh
air
other
people
were
there
too
and
i
was
excited
to
meet
new
people
we
started
to
play
some
of
our
favorite
icebreaker
games
getting
to
know
each
other
by
the
end
of
the
day
i
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
peace
and
contentment
taking
outdoor
activities
with
friends
family
or
by
yourself
is
the
best
way
to
enjoy
nature
and
the
weather
making
a
plan
to
become
a
better
person
is
an
essential
step
in
self improvement
by
making
a
list
of
the
areas
of
your
life
that
you
want
to
improve
such
as
health
time
management
relationships
finances
etc
once
you
ve
identified
which
areas
you
d
like
to
focus
on
it
s
time
to
develop
strategies
for
achieving
your
goals
this
could
include
getting
into
a
regular
exercise
routine
creating
a
budget
and
sticking
to
it
learning
to
say
no
when
needed
or
making
time
for
a
hobby
additionally
it
s
important
to
remember
that
self improvement
should
be
a
continuous
process
so
make
sure
to
check
in
with
yourself
regularly
and
be
open
to
trying
new
approaches
as
no
two
people
have
the
same
needs
by
taking
the
time
to
plan
and
make
proactive
decisions
you
ll
be
well
on
your
way
to
becoming
the
best
version
of
yourself
failure
is
a
natural
part
of
the
pursuit
of
success
when
we
fail
we
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
persevere
in
finding
ways
to
succeed
without
taking
risks
we
would
never
reach
our
goals
and
be
able
to
fully
achieve
our
potential
taking
chances
and
learning
from
our
mistakes
enthusiasm
also
plays
an
essential
role
in
our
success
being
passionate
and
driven
motivates
us
to
stay
focused
and
empowered
when
we
put
effort
into
our
projects
and
dreams
we
increase
our
chances
of
succeeding
and
reaping
the
rewards
for
our
hard
work
we
should
be
excited
and
inspired
by
our
goals
and
cultivate
a
positive
attitude
and
proactive
approach
to
work
towards
achieving
them
by
understanding
that
failure
is
a
necessary
part
of
success
and
embracing
our
enthusiasm
we
can
reach
our
goals
and
be
successful
making
a
commitment
to
a
chosen
career
path
when
entering
high
school
can
offer
students
a
wide
range
of
benefits
and
foremost
students
have
the
opportunity
to
begin
focusing
more
seriously
on
the
specific
course
of
study
most
relevant
to
their
chosen
career
and
hone
in
on
skills
that
will
be
required
for
their
chosen
field
doing
so
will
also
provide
more
structure
to
their
high
school
curriculum
allowing
them
to
save
money
on
courses
that
wo
n t
be
necessary
for
their
eventual
career
although
there
are
numerous
benefits
to
encouraging
students
to
commit
to
a
career
choice
early
there
are
also
potential
drawbacks
by
focusing
on
one
career
path
students
can
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
to
explore
areas
of
interest
that
may
come
up
in
the
future
as
a
result
they
can
become
more
rigid
in
the
academic
and
career
paths
they
have
chosen
and
may
not
be
open
to
other
areas
of
study
additionally
having
to
commit
to
a
career
so
early
can
also
lead
to
more
stress
and
anxiety
amongst
students
high
schools
that
do
offer
career
options
can
give
students
a
jump start
into
the
professional
world
they
enable
them
to
prepare
for
college
earlier
and
better
equip
themselves
with
the
skills
they
need
to
pursue
their
chosen
career
on
the
other
hand
schools
that
do
not
offer
career
options
may
unintentionally
narrow
a
student
s
choices
or
lack
the
resources
to
provide
career
guidance
that
can
be
essential
for
career
exploration
choosing
one
s
career
early
in
life
versus
later
in
life
has
its
own
set
of
pros
and
cons
making
a
career
decision
early
on
can
give
students
a
head
start
and
allow
them
to
begin
the
groundwork
while
waiting
until
later
in
life
may
provide
a
more
varied
experience
allowing
students
to
explore
more
opportunities
before
making
a
final
decision
no
matter
which
option
is
chosen
however
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
ensure
that
students
have
a
college ready
application
so
that
they
can
access
the
best
resources
available
to
them
for
pursuing
the
career
of
their
choice
the
introduction
of
cellphones
in
the
classroom
has
long
been
a
controversial
topic
as
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
allowing
their
use
on
one
hand
cellphones
in
the
classroom
can
be
an
effective
tool
for
educational
purposes
fostering
creativity
and
engagement
through
the
use
of
digital
tools
and
applications
however
they
can
also
be
distracting
and
may
cause
discipline
issues
if
students
are
not
properly
supervised
on
the
positive
side
permitting
students
to
use
their
cellphones
can
enable
them
to
make
use
of
the
many
educational
applications
available
today
it
can
also
help
to
encourage
creativity
by
enabling
students
to
access
a
wide
range
of
digital
resources
with
the
click
of
a
button
by
allowing
students
to
access
these
resources
teachers
can
create
a
more
interactive
learning
atmosphere
encouraging
meaningful
discussions
and
collaborations
that
being
said
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
permitting
students
to
use
their
cellphones
for
educational
purposes
in
the
classroom
cellphones
can
be
a
major
distraction
in
the
classroom
as
students
may
be
tempted
to
use
them
for
activities
unrelated
to
learning
and
can
take
away
from
class
time
additionally
students
may
misuse
their
phones
to
cheat
or
to
engage
in
inappropriate
activities
leading
to
discipline
issues
in
conclusion
while
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
to
permitting
students
to
use
their
cellphones
for
educational
purposes
in
the
classroom
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
educator
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
allow
their
use
by
implementing
clear
policies
and
guidelines
for
phone
use
educators
can
ensure
that
students
make
the
most
of
their
learning
experience
is
no
doubt
a
powerful
tool
in
life
but
it
is
not
the
sole
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
individual
will
find
success
it
is
possible
to
be
excessively
positive
and
not
have
any
tangible
results
to
show
for
it
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
research
that
has
shown
that
a
combination
of
positive
and
negative
thinking
can
often
lead
to
more
successful
outcomes
this
is
because
embracing
negativity
or
even
just
the
possibility
of
failure
can
provide
people
with
the
motivation
and
drive
necessary
to
push
ahead
even
during
difficult
times
it
can
also
offer
valuable
perspective
and
provide
lessons
that
can
inform
future
decisions
ultimately
positivity
is
not
the
sole
key
to
success
but
if
balanced
with
other
forms
of
thought
it
can
be
an
invaluable
asset
in
reaching
goals
when
considering
whether
to
add
one
and
a
half
more
hours
to
the
school
day
several
important
factors
must
be
taken
into
account
firstly
providing
an
extended
school
day
would
take
away
from
time
students
otherwise
would
spend
on
after school
activities
such
as
club
meetings
or
sports
practices
for
instance
a
student
who
is
on
the
school
s
football
team
would
have
to
decide
between
sacrificing
time
spent
developing
their
team
skills
or
risk
sacrificing
their
academic
pursuits
secondly
this
extra
hour
and
a
half
would
also
put
a
strain
on
our
already
stretched
teachers
and
staff
as
the
school
day
length
increases
so
do
the
workloads
for
teachers
making
it
harder
for
them
to
focus
on
their
students
additionally
due
to
the
lack
of
time
for
other
pursuits
such
as
research
the
pay
might
become
too
poor
to
attract
new
teachers
and
staff
finally
this
longer
school
day
would
leave
students
tired
and
unable
to
learn
as
effectively
as
they
would
when
properly
rested
during
an
extended
school
day
students
would
be
less
alert
and
less
likely
to
absorb
what
they
are
taught
reducing
the
quality
of
their
education
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
reasons
why
the
school
should
not
add
one
and
a
half
more
hours
to
the
school
day
it
is
important
to
take
student
s
health
well being
and
education
into
account
when
determining
what
is
best
for
the
school
i
strongly
urge
the
school
against
extending
the
school
day
the
power
of
imagination
has
been
described
as
an
invaluable
tool
for
navigating
the
world
it
can
create
and
shape
one
s
perception
of
reality
while
producing
seemingly
limitless
possibilities
for
the
future
imagination
allows
us
to
think
beyond
the
limits
of
our
own
knowledge
challenging
us
to
explore
unknown
territories
it
has
the
potential
to
expose
us
to
revolutionary
ideas
that
can
lead
to
groundbreaking
discoveries
when
comparing
imagination
to
knowledge
imagination
takes
the
lead
is
important
and
necessary
it
is
a
form
of
understanding
and
can
be
critical
for
learning
but
knowledge
can
often
be
rigid
and
restrictive
adhering
to
traditional
ideas
with
limited
potential
for
growth
or
innovation
is
fluid
without
bounds
or
rules
it
gives
us
the
power
to
explore
the
seemingly
impossible
producing
radical
ideas
and
stimulating
creative
problem solving
it
can
be
argued
that
imagination
is
essential
for
progress
creativity
and
innovation
are
paramount
for
collective
growth
and
these
qualities
could
not
be
achieved
without
the
freedom
of
imagination
this
freedom
shapes
the
world
we
live
in
as
well
as
the
future
generations
in
conclusion
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge
for
many
reasons
it
provides
an
expansive
view
of
reality
that
can
lead
us
to
achieving
greatness
imagination
can
be
the
foundation
for
creativity
and
inspiration
to
solve
problems
unleash
progress
and
fuel
progress
for
generations
to
come
it
is
commonly
held
belief
that
to
be
successful
one
must
always
be
busy
doing
something
this
idea
can
be
seen
everywhere
from
and
coffee
mugs
with
words
like
hustle
and
grind
to
people
bragging
about
how
much
time
they
are
putting
in
at
work
or
what
they
are
accomplishing
while
it
is
certainly
important
to
stay
active
and
productive
it
is
equally
true
that
inactivity
can
be
useful
in
its
own
way
rather
than
looking
at
inactivity
as
time
wasted
it
can
be
seen
as
a
form
of
rest
that
allows
people
to
replenish
their
energy
reserves
and
engage
in
mindful
self reflection
taking
mental
breaks
and
engaging
in
relaxation
techniques
can
reduce
stress
foster
creativity
and
help
us
to
recharge
both
physically
and
emotionally
when
we
are
constantly
going
going
going
our
activities
tend
to
blend
together
and
we
become
desensitized
to
our
environment
connecting
with
the
world
and
ourselves
can
be
a
powerful
source
of
inspiration
and
renewal
is
n t
always
passive
however
it
can
be
used
proactively
to
our
advantage
doing
nothing
can
actually
give
us
time
to
reflect
and
evaluate
our
thoughts
plans
and
goals
allowing
us
to
assess
our
progress
and
give
ourselves
the
opportunity
to
adjust
accordingly
how
can
we
truly
appreciate
what
we
have
achieved
and
where
we
want
to
go
if
we
never
stop
running
in
a
nutshell
balance
is
the
key
too
much
or
too
little
activity
can
be
detrimental
ultimately
a
combination
of
both
is
necessary
to
move
forward
and
maximize
our
potential
serves
a
purpose
and
when
used
properly
can
be
a
powerful
tool
impressions
hold
immense
power
in
forming
relationships
both
in
the
short
and
long
term
a
bad
first
impression
may
lead
to
a
sour
start
whereas
a
great
one
can
set
the
foundation
for
an
enduring
positive
connection
nonetheless
because
individuals
are
always
subject
to
change
so
too
can
a
first
impression
as
people
become
more
familiar
with
each
other
or
as
circumstances
decrease
the
significance
of
the
original
encounter
a
first
impression
can
be
altered
for
better
or
for
worse
for
this
reason
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
relationships
can
improve
or
diminish
over
time
regardless
of
the
initial
encounter
one
important
reason
students
should
take
four
years
of
high
school
is
because
they
will
have
more
time
to
learn
during
this
extra
year
students
can
take
more
classes
and
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
topics
they
are
studying
with
the
extra
year
in
school
students
also
have
the
opportunity
to
take
electives
which
can
help
them
find
out
what
interests
them
as
they
prepare
for
their
future
careers
moreover
having
an
extra
year
in
school
also
provides
students
with
more
freedom
and
flexibility
studies
have
shown
that
extended
summer
vacations
and
evening
time
with
family
and
friends
can
have
positive
effects
on
students
mental
health
and
help
them
develop
life
skills
with
the
extra
year
of
high
school
students
will
have
more
time
to
do
the
things
they
want
to
do
while
still
continuing
to
pursue
their
education
in
conclusion
four
years
of
high
school
are
beneficial
for
students
as
they
can
have
more
time
to
learn
enjoy
more
diverse
classes
and
electives
and
have
more
time
to
enjoy
the
different
aspects
of
life
they
wish
to
explore
taking
four
years
of
high
school
can
be
beneficial
to
students
in
the
long
run
as
it
will
give
them
the
opportunity
to
truly
focus
on
their
education
and
become
better
prepared
for
their
future
paths
technology
has
undoubtedly
changed
the
landscape
of
our
lives
in
many
positive
ways
we
now
have
unprecedented
access
to
information
and
resources
we
can
communicate
faster
and
easier
than
ever
before
and
information
is
increasingly
at
our
fingertips
however
with
this
convenience
comes
a
range
of
potential
dangers
technology
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
people
disrupting
meaningful
relationships
and
conversation
and
encouraging
people
to
be
careless
about
important
tasks
and
activities
to
mitigate
the
potential
negative
effects
of
technology
usage
it
is
important
to
make
deliberate
efforts
to
establish
and
maintain
meaningful
relationships
this
can
be
done
by
setting
boundaries
such
as
limiting
the
amount
of
time
people
spend
on
their
devices
and
creating
pockets
of
time
during
the
day
where
devices
are
not
allowed
additionally
people
should
aim
for
quality
over
quantity
when
it
comes
to
conversations
taking
the
time
to
really
engage
with
someone
can
be
far
more
meaningful
than
passive
scrolling
finally
it
is
important
to
look
for
opportunities
to
unplug
such
as
engaging
in
outdoor
activities
or
attending
events

establishments
is
simply
brimming
with
life
and
energy
whether
you
re
here
for
a
day
or
want
to
stay
and
explore
for
a
week
you
ll
be
sure
to
make
some
unforgettable
memories
to
understand
why
it
is
such
an
intriguing
place
all
you
need
to
do
is
come
and
explore
when
considering
career
choices
for
high
school
students
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
consequences
of
making
the
wrong
choice
and
the
benefits
of
exploring
requiring
students
to
decide
on
a
career
when
they
first
enter
high
school
can
lead
to
many
of
them
feeling
overwhelmed
stressed
out
and
unprepared
not
only
could
this
put
them
in
a
difficult
position
when
it
comes
to
choosing
the
right
path
but
it
could
also
potentially
lead
to
them
making
the
wrong
choice
one
that
might
not
be
beneficial
to
them
in
the
long
run
on
the
other
hand
maturing
and
gaining
knowledge
about
different
careers
before
making
a
decision
can
be
highly
beneficial
students
who
are
able
to
explore
their
interests
and
learn
more
about
potential
career
paths
will
be
better
equipped
to
make
informed
decisions
when
the
time
comes
they
will
be
able
to
consider
various
options
weigh
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
each
and
determine
which
ones
are
best
suited
to
their
individual
skills
and
talents
this
will
give
them
the
opportunity
to
build
a
career
that
is
both
meaningful
and
fulfilling
in
conclusion
there
are
many
potential
risks
associated
with
requiring
students
to
choose
a
career
when
they
first
enter
high
school
it
is
much
better
to
allow
students
the
chance
to
explore
and
learn
more
about
different
career
paths
before
making
a
final
decision
by
doing
so
they
will
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
make
an
educated
decision
one
that
is
both
beneficial
and
satisfying
the
teenage
years
are
often
seen
as
a
time
of
exploration
and
testing
limits
it
is
during
this
time
that
youths
can
explore
their
passions
and
interests
without
consequence
however
failure
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
life
despite
the
fear
of
failure
that
hinders
many
teens
failure
itself
has
its
pros
and
cons
on
the
positive
side
failure
can
make
someone
a
better
person
failing
as
a
teen
gives
an
individual
the
opportunity
to
identify
their
weaknesses
and
grow
from
it
it
forces
teens
to
assess
themselves
build
self awareness
and
consider
how
to
improve
their
skills
or
approach
uncomfortable
as
a
lesson
in
failure
may
be
it
can
create
emotional
maturity
and
humility
this
self reflection
and
insight
can
be
invaluable
in
later
life
on
the
other
hand
failure
as
a
teen
can
have
profound
ramifications
many
teens
take
failure
personally
letting
it
shape
their
self confidence
and
their
views
of
the
world
and
their
future
it
can
also
lead
to
a
feeling
of
being
stuck
or
broken
and
thus
unable
to
move
forward
in
some
cases
a
teen
that
experiences
failure
could
find
their
hopes
and
aspirations
dashed
at
the
end
of
the
day
failure
as
a
teen
is
unavoidable
how
one
chooses
to
tackle
the
situation
and
learn
from
it
will
have
powerful
implications
for
the
future
it
is
important
to
remember
that
everyone
has
at
least
one
failure
in
their
life
and
the
key
is
to
know
how
to
use
this
to
one
s
advantage
with
the
right
mindset
and
guidance
failure
can
be
a
fantastic
teacher
and
provide
opportunities
to
become
a
better
person
extending
the
school
day
to
hours
could
provide
students
with
enough
time
to
both
complete
their
homework
and
get
sufficient
rest
this
change
could
have
both
positive
and
negative
impacts
on
the
students
and
teachers
on
the
one
hand
more
time
in
the
classroom
could
enable
students
to
pursue
more
activities
such
as
extracurriculars
that
would
otherwise
be
impossible
due
to
the
time
constraints
that
come
with
a
normal
hour
school
day
additionally
it
could
also
benefit
the
teacher student
relationship
as
teachers
have
more
time
to
connect
with
their
students
on
the
other
hand
the
change
would
place
a
strain
on
energy
water
and
other
resources
as
more
time
in
class
would
require
more
resources
to
accommodate
therefore
it
may
be
better
for
schools
to
opt
for
four
hour
days
instead
of
five
hour
days
as
this
would
balance
out
the
resource
consumption
while
still
providing
students
with
ample
time
for
their
homework
and
rest
imagination
is
an
invaluable
tool
that
ought
to
be
used
in
tandem
with
knowledge
to
uncover
creativity
and
greater
understanding
of
the
world
rather
than
being
limited
to
a
mere
collection
of
facts
imagination
helps
to
create
new
pathways
for
exploration
that
reflect
our
individual
perspectives
for
example
think
of
the
many
inventions
and
advances
in
science
or
art
that
have
been
made
not
out
of
methodical
analysis
or
study
but
instead
out
of
imagination
and
creativity
a
good
example
of
this
is
s
invention
of
the
telephone
something
he
thought
of
while
contemplating
ways
to
send
multiple
telegraph
messages
at
the
same
time
our
ability
to
daydream
unlocks
potential
for
new
and
exciting
ideas
theories
and
inventions
letting
our
imaginations
run
free
can
take
us
places
our
knowledge
might
never
have
us
go
when
it
comes
to
learning
working
together
in
groups
can
be
hugely
beneficial
not
only
can
groups
provide
increased
motivation
and
productivity
but
they
also
help
to
foster
and
develop
interpersonal
skills
collaborative
problem
solving
and
communication
this
makes
them
an
incredibly
valuable
tool
for
students
to
use
in
order
to
become
more
successful
when
working
on
school
projects
the
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
are
clear
collaboration
can
help
to
ensure
that
tasks
are
completed
quickly
and
to
a
high
standard
as
well
as
providing
each
member
with
a
chance
to
develop
new
skills
for
those
looking
ahead
to
their
career
working
together
can
equip
students
with
the
key
skills
needed
for
working
with
different
professionals
in
the
future
finally
working
together
can
be
valuable
in
helping
to
prepare
students
for
life
after
school
can
act
as
an
incubator
for
development
with
members
exchanging
new
ideas
and
developing
themselves
professionally
ultimately
the
ability
to
work
together
and
problem solve
in
a
team
can
make
a
huge
impact
on
the
success
of
students
later
in
life
there
are
a
number
of
ways
for
students
to
take
advantage
of
the
benefits
of
working
together
these
include
encouraging
openness
in
communication
and
active
listening
meeting
deadlines
and
setting
achievable
goals
as
well
as
having
a
positive
attitude
and
taking
ownership
of
tasks
ultimately
by
leveraging
the
power
of
collaboration
students
can
become
more
successful
and
better
prepared
for
the
future
a
day
break
after
every
weeks
of
schooling
would
be
beneficial
in
many
ways
firstly
students
would
have
a
chance
to
take
a
step
back
and
refresh
helping
them
become
more
attentive
and
engaged
in
their
classroom
studies
studies
have
shown
that
regular
breaks
can
improve
a
student
s
motivation
focus
and
relationship
with
their
teachers
additionally
taking
breaks
regularly
allows
for
students
to
experience
a
variety
of
activities
that
are
not
typically
found
in
the
classroom
many
students
have
reported
in
surveys
that
learning
something
new
or
doing
something
creative
during
the
break
has
helped
them
gain
unique
insights
and
knowledge
that
they
can
then
apply
in
their
studies
finally
breaking
up
the
school
year
into
shorter
intervals
can
also
help
reduce
student
fatigue
and
stress
students
would
be
able
to
better
manage
their
coursework
and
have
more
time
for
rest
and
relaxation
that
have
implemented
the
day
break
initiative
have
also
noted
that
overall
attendance
and
grades
have
improved
significantly
showing
the
impact
such
breaks
have
on
students
academic
performance
in
conclusion
regular
breaks
offer
many
benefits
allowing
for
students
to
both
engage
in
scholastic
activities
and
enjoy
leisure
activities
outside
of
the
classroom
it
is
evident
that
implementing
the
day
break
after
every
weeks
of
schooling
can
drastically
improve
a
student
s
academic
motivation
and
performance
schooling
has
become
increasingly
popular
over
the
past
decade
as
students
and
parents
alike
have
begun
to
explore
the
potential
benefits
that
it
offers
on
the
positive
side
online
schooling
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
work
at
their
own
pace
and
learn
at
a
time
and
location
that
works
best
for
them
it
also
allows
for
more
personalized
instruction
from
teachers
tailored
educational
experiences
and
improved
communication
with
teachers
and
peers
on
the
other
hand
online
schooling
also
carries
some
drawbacks
for
instance
it
can
be
difficult
for
students
to
stay
motivated
and
focused
without
classroom
structure
and
support
which
can
lead
to
higher
dropout
rates
additionally
online
schooling
does
not
provide
the
same
level
of
social
and
emotional
support
which
students
often
need
to
thrive
in
conclusion
whether
or
not
online
schooling
is
a
good
idea
for
students
depends
on
their
individual
goals
and
circumstances
with
the
right
supports
in
place
online
schooling
can
give
students
the
opportunity
to
learn
at
their
own
pace
and
customize
their
educational
experience
to
fit
their
needs
however
those
same
students
also
run
the
risk
of
losing
focus
and
motivation
without
the
structure
and
community
of
a
traditional
school
ultimately
the
decision
to
pursue
online
schooling
should
be
discussed
and
assessed
on
an
individual
basis
i
recently
decided
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
different
subjects
taught
in
elementary
schools
across
the
country
to
better
understand
how
the
learning
process
takes
place
i
talked
with
current
teachers
about
their
teaching
styles
and
techniques
for
engaging
students
i
also
researched
different
ways
to
make
lessons
interesting
and
engaging
i
asked
family
members
and
friends
about
their
own
elementary
school
experiences
what
they
enjoyed
and
found
difficult
i
wanted
to
observe
students
in
an
elementary
school
to
see
how
they
interact
and
learn
so
visited
an
elementary
school
in
my
area
it
was
fascinating
to
observe
how
the
children
absorbed
the
knowledge
and
interacted
with
each
other
afterwards
i
learned
about
different
activities
and
games
which
could
be
exciting
for
elementary
school
students
with
this
in
mind
i
prepared
a
lesson
plan
for
teaching
an
elementary
school
subject
is
unpredictable
and
full
of
uncertainties
and
no
one
likes
to
fail
or
face
hardships
however
it
is
important
to
keep
believing
in
yourself
and
to
have
hope
no
matter
what
having
hope
in
life
means
that
we
can
look
to
the
future
despite
any
challenges
we
may
face
it
means
having
faith
that
things
will
get
better
and
that
we
can
learn
from
our
mistakes
the
lessons
we
learn
from
life
can
often
be
applied
to
our
own
lives
for
example
if
we
learn
to
value
the
little
things
in
life
then
we
will
be
more
content
and
grateful
for
what
we
have
not
always
chasing
after
material
goods
or
things
that
do
n t
necessarily
bring
us
happiness
similarly
if
we
put
in
the
effort
to
work
towards
our
goals
it
can
help
to
cultivate
optimism
and
resilience
without
hope
we
can
become
disillusioned
and
neglect
the
things
that
matter
we
view
life
as
meaningless
or
hopeless
we
may
fall
into
a
negative
state
of
mind
become
apathetic
and
lose
touch
with
reality
too
much
negativity
can
make
it
hard
to
build
relationships
and
it
can
start
to
hinder
us
from
achieving
our
goals
and
making
progress
in
conclusion
it
is
essential
to
keep
believing
in
oneself
and
to
never
lose
hope
in
life
doing
so
can
help
us
stay
positive
and
find
meaning
even
in
the
most
difficult
of
times
we
can
learn
valuable
lessons
from
life
that
can
be
applicable
to
our
own
lives
and
by
having
hope
we
give
ourselves
the
opportunity
to
have
a
more
rewarding
and
fulfilling
life
extending
the
school
day
can
have
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
on
the
one
hand
adding
two
extra
hours
for
students
and
teachers
could
provide
more
educational
opportunities
and
allow
teachers
to
cover
more
material
on
the
other
hand
some
students
and
teachers
may
not
have
the
ability
to
stay
later
due
to
work
or
family
commitments
when
considering
the
benefit
of
adding
time
in
the
school
day
there
are
two
main
possibilities
the
first
is
adding
an
extra
hour
to
each
school
subject
this
allows
for
more
in depth
study
of
each
subject
and
more
time
for
engaging
activities
or
discussions
which
can
be
beneficial
for
understanding
and
mastering
material
the
second
is
adding
an
extra
school
subject
this
could
be
useful
for
a
range
of
reasons
such
as
enabling
students
to
take
advanced
or
specialized
courses
or
providing
more
opportunities
to
explore
their
interests
however
an
extended
school
day
also
comes
with
certain
drawbacks
teachers
may
feel
pressured
to
cover
more
material
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
while
students
may
feel
overwhelmed
and
overworked
additionally
if
students
and
teachers
are
expected
to
stay
longer
they
may
not
get
as
much
free
time
for
extracurricular
activities
or
socializing
which
can
have
a
negative
impact
on
their
mental
and
physical
health
to
make
an
extended
school
day
successful
certain
strategies
are
necessary
teachers
should
be
provided
additional
support
for
planning
and
teaching
their
lessons
additionally
alternative
courses
and
activities
should
be
available
for
students
to
engage
in
after
traditional
classes
such
as
physical
education
music
and
art
classes
finally
free
time
and
socialization
should
be
encouraged
and
supported
for
both
students
and
teachers
to
help
them
manage
the
challenges
of
the
longer
school
day
i
have
found
that
the
key
to
increasing
success
in
life
is
to
take
small
steps
that
lead
to
long term
growth
from
my
personal
experience
i
have
identified
three
steps
which
when
followed
consistently
have
contributed
to
my
own
successes
setting
meaningful
goals
soldiering
on
even
when
facing
setbacks
and
creating
new
opportunities
when
it
comes
to
setting
goals
you
should
identify
measurable
objectives
that
are
within
reach
yet
still
challenging
by
setting
achievable
goals
you
will
cultivate
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
which
will
increase
your
motivation
and
result
in
further
successes
no
matter
how
well
you
plan
setbacks
are
always
a
part
of
life
when
confronted
with
difficulties
we
should
persist
by
utilizing
the
resources
and
knowledge
at
our
disposal
taking
the
time
to
problem
solve
and
maintaining
high
spirits
can
be
key
in
ultimately
overcoming
obstacles
and
achieving
desired
goals
lastly
it
is
important
to
always
be
on
the
lookout
for
new
opportunities
whether
it
is
a
job
offer
a
hobby
that
sparks
your
interest
or
a
mentor
to
gain
important
new
perspectives
learning
new
things
can
open
doors
that
weren
t
previously
available
and
provide
a
much needed
break
from
daily
routines
taking
action
and
actively
pursuing
new
opportunities
can
be
a
significant
catalyst
to
increased
success
success
in
life
comes
not
from
idling
but
from
actively
pursuing
one
s
goals
in
s
famous
quote
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
the
demonstrated
a
great
deal
of
insight
into
human
potential
active
and
productive
can
open
doors
to
a
world
of
achievements
as
long
as
we
utilize
our
time
strategically
is
a
major
part
of
success
and
it
is
important
to
remember
that
idle
people
have
lower
chances
for
success
those
who
prioritize
action taking
are
much
more
likely
to
create
tangible
accomplishments
in
their
life
career
and
relationships
imagine
the
rewards
of
setting
longer term
goals
and
pushing
yourself
to
completion
instead
of
avoiding
challenges
active
people
can
bravely
battle
difficult
tasks
and
come
out
more
successful
than
before
when
we
take
action
something
powerful
begins
to
take
our
life
in
an
intentional
direction
everything
is
in
our
control
from
forming
relationships
to
controlling
finances
the
possibilities
are
endless
when
we
make
a
conscious
effort
to
develop
our
life
and
work
when
embarking
on
a
significant
project
big
or
small
one
should
take
a
break
in
between
milestones
without
making
breaks
for
your
own
well being
excess
work
can
easily
cause
burnout
it
s
true
that
much
can
be
accomplished
when
we
are
constantly
active
taking
action
is
the
key
to
succeeding
and
reaching
goals
so
heed
s
words
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
is
an
ideal
destination
for
anyone
looking
for
a
vibrant
and
exciting
vacation
the
country
is
steeped
in
cultural
and
historical
attractions
each
telling
its
own
unique
story
take
and
two
spanish
cities
that
reverberate
with
history
and
tradition

the

is
becoming
increasingly
apparent
it

to
overstate
the
importance
of
these
jobs
in
providing
people
with
a

stability
and
a

however
technology
continues

impacting
our

indeed
to
create

at
the

time
technology
has
made
certain
types
of
jobs
obsolete
automation
has
displaced
manual
labor
and
workers
in
many
fields
and
as
technology
continues
to
advance
more
jobs
will
be
replaced
by
machines
while
this
can
lead
to
increased
efficiency
and
a
better functioning
economy
it
has
also
caused
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
insecurity
in
the
end
it
is
clear
that
although
technology
can
make
it
easier
to
find

perform
jobs
it
also
has
the
potential
to
displace
workers
in
order
to
maximize
the
benefits
of
technology
while
minimizing
its
drawbacks
people
must
be
mindful
of
the
need
for
job
security
this
means
investing
in
training
and
education
as
well
as
taking
measures
to
ensure
that
jobs
are
safe
and
equitable
in
this
way
we
can
ensure
that
individuals
have
access

traditional
learning
and
distance
learning
are
two
popular
options
for
students
seeking
to
further
their
education
each
has
its
own
unique
benefits
and
drawbacks
that
must
be
compared
when
choosing
the
best
educational
setting
for
a
particular
student
traditional
classroom
learning
offers
students
the
opportunity
to
learn
in
a
focused
environment
in
an
interactive
atmosphere
students
can
take
part
in
group
discussions
and
activities
and
benefit
from
direct
interaction
with
the
instructor
and
classmates
during
lectures
and
lab
work
moreover
students
in
a
traditional
classroom
environment
are
able
to
develop
relationships
with
other
peers
which
can
help
them
understand
complex
material
better
on
the
other
hand
distance
learning
allows
students
the
convenience
of
studying
and
engaging
with
course
material
at
their
own
pace
and
in
their
own
space
it
is
often
less
expensive
than
traditional
learning
as
there
are
no
physical
restrictions
to
the
number
of
students
involved
and
no
travel
or
accommodation
expenses
additionally
distance
learning
provides
access
to
a
wider
variety
of
learning
resources
such
as
lectures
and
videos
which
can
be
accessed
at
any
time
ultimately
each
educational
setting
has
its
own
set
of
benefits
and
drawbacks
that
must
be
carefully
considered
when
researching
and
choosing
the
best
option
for
each
student
traditional
classroom
learning
may
be
the
best
alternative
for
some
students
as
it
is
an
effective
way
to
facilitate
learning
and
engagement
with
course
material
and
develop
relationships
with
other
peers
on
the
other
hand
distance
learning
provides
a
convenient
and
often
less
expensive
option
for
those
seeking
to
further
their
education
in
conclusion
both
traditional
classroom
learning
and
distance
learning
offer
educational
options
that
must
be
weighed
against
one
another
to
determine
the
best
fit
for
each
student
traditional
classroom
learning
provides
students
with
an
interactive
and
engaging
learning
atmosphere
that
can
facilitate
understanding
and
connection
to
the
course
material
while
distance

the

in
their

and
at
their
own
pace
there
is
an
old
proverb
that
states
to
thine
own
self
be
true
this
is
a
very
wise
saying
and
one
that
we
should
all
take
to
heart
being
true
to
oneself
is
essential
to
a
happy
and
fulfilling
life
it
means
being
honest
with
your
true
feelings
ideas
and
values
acting
contrary
to
them
can
bring
conflicts
rejection
and
suffering
while
remaining
true
to
oneself
leads
to
contentment
and
satisfaction
the
pressures
and
expectations
of
society
can
be
extremely
strong
we
often
find
ourselves
feeling
the
need
to
conform
to
certain
standards
and
conventions
instead
of
allowing
our
true
selves
to
shine
through
this
kind
of
behavior
however
can
be
detrimental
not
only
will
it
place
us
in
difficult
positions
it
can
lead
to
an
erosion
of
our
individual
identities
if
we
are
n t
true
to
ourselves
our
unique
personalities
creativity
and
capabilities
may
be
suppressed
and
eventually
forgotten
on
the
other
hand
by
being
true
to
ourselves
we
will
create
a
life
built
on
our
own
strengths
and
passions
we
will
be
able
to
use
our
uniqueness
to
the
fullest
potential
and
enjoy
the
rewards
of
a
life
that
is
genuinely
ours
we
will
also
be
able
to
remain
true
to
our
values
goals
and
beliefs
and
those
around
us
will
see
us
for
who
we
truly
are
people
will
recognize
and
appreciate
our
authenticity
which
can
open
many
doors
to
success
and
satisfy
our
sense
of
purpose
being
true
to
oneself
is
essential
for
a
healthy
and
prosperous
life
self confidence
and
fulfillment
are
the
rewards
of
staying
true
to
our
own
values
passions
and
talents
and
by
embracing
our
authentic
selves
we
can
create
a
life
that
is
both
meaningful
and
fulfilling
despite
some
potential
advantages
a
four
day
school
week
can
present
some
difficulties
for
students
for
example
students
may
not
have
the
time
to
engage
in
extracurricular
activities
that
would
otherwise
be
beneficial
to
their
development
without
a
day
to
practice
sports
teams
participate
in
clubs
or
get
help
with
homework
certain
activities
become
increasingly
difficult
to
manage
additionally
students
looking
to
make
money
by
working
part time
may
be
held
back
by
reduced
hours
due
to
the
shorter
school
week
moreover
students
without
alternate
supervision
during
an
extra
non school
day
may
have
difficulty
helping
out
with
younger
siblings
or
other
siblings
needs
due
to
their
own
school
commitments
while
there
are
potential
savings
in
energy
and
resources
from
having
shorter
weeks
the
amount
of
time
that
students
have
to
learn
new
material
is
reduced
as
well
with
less
time
spent
in
class
teachers
don
t
have
as
much
time
to
dive
into
difficult
concepts
create
projects
or
provide
additional
instruction
to
struggling
students
additionally
the
catch up
that
the
students
have
to
do
after
a
day
away
from
school
can
add
extra
stress
to
their
lives
as
an
illustration
of
the
issues
that
students
can
face
with
a
four
day
school
week
imagine
a
student
who
needs
to
balance
playing
in
the
band
helping
out
with
his
younger
brother
and
having
a
part time
job
having
the
extra
day
off
from
school
greatly
reduces
the
amount
of
time
he
has
to
practice
and
his
ability
to
find
time
to
help
his
brother
with
his
own
homework
the
savings
in
energy
and
resources
from
the
four
day
school
week
is
far
outweighed
by
the
pressure
it
can
put
on
students
who
have
further
commitments
outside
of
their
school
day
remains
a
powerful
example
of
perseverance
and
success
despite
failure
was
a
british
statesman
most
famously
known
for
his
leadership
during
however
his
successes
as
a
politician
did
not
come
easy
despite
experiencing
a
multitude
of
failures
early
in
his
life
he
refused
to
give
in
and
kept
pushing
himself
forward
ultimately
becoming
one
of
s
most
legendary
figures
his
famous
quote
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
emphasizes
the
importance
of
not
giving
up
in
the
face
of
difficulty
instead
persevering
and
striving
for
success
to
understand
better
how
to
continue
striving
in
the
face
of
repeated
failure
let
s
examine
a
hypothetical
scenario
a
student
is
struggling
to
pass
a
difficult
college
course
and
has
already
failed
the
course
four
times
it
would
be
easy
for
the
student
to
become
disheartened
and
give
up
especially
with
the
overwhelming
challenge
of
preparing
for
and
taking
yet
another
exam
but
that
student
must
remember
s
advice
and
take
courage
in
the
knowledge
that
failure
can
lead
to
success
if
it
is
met
with
dedication
and
consistency
to
support
not
losing
enthusiasm
after
failure
an
essay
should
emphasize
that
life
is
full
of
challenges
and
how
failure
is
inextricably
linked
to
success
point
out
the
detrimental
mental
emotional
and
physical
effects
of
allowing
the
persistence
of
failure
to
cause
someone
to
give
up
readers
that
a
success
story
is
more
than
just
endings
and
that
the
path
to
success
is
likely
to
be
filled
with
setbacks
finally
encourage
readers
that
re centering
and
recalibrating
after
failure
is
a
normal
part
of
life
and
essential
for
anyone
seeking
to
reach
their
goals
on
a
personal
or
professional
level
it
is
important
to
remain
consistent
and
not
give
up
after
failure
through
researching
the
achievements
of
and
exploring
a
hypothetical
scenario
it
has
become
clear
that
the
courage
to
continue
despite
failure
is
the
only
way
to
experience
lasting
success
choosing
to
take
responsibility
for
our
decisions
and
actions
is
an
important
step
in
achieving
personal
growth
taking
responsibility
shows
that
we
are
mature
and
capable
of
making
sound
judgments
it
is
a
sign
that
we
are
able
to
accept
the
consequences
of
our
choices
and
learn
from
them
by
taking
responsibility
for
ourselves
we
can
minimize
the
number
of
regrets
we
have
in
life
and
start
to
look
forward
when
we
take
responsibility
for
ourselves
it
reinforces
the
idea
that
we
are
in
control
of
our
lives
we
no
longer
blame
others
for
our
mistakes
or
misfortunes
instead
we
learn
to
take
ownership
of
our
decisions
and
choices
grow
from
them
and
make
changes
to
ensure
healthier
decisions
in
the
future
this
can
lead
to
the
development
of
better
coping
skills
and
improved
problem solving
abilities
that
can
help
us
work
through
difficult
situations
taking
responsibility
for
our
own
decisions
and
actions
is
not
only
beneficial
for
ourselves
but
also
for
those
around
us
by
setting
a
good
example
and
taking
ownership
for
our
behavior
we
are
showing
those
around
us
that
it
is
important
to
be
accountable
for
our
actions
so
that
we
do
not
hurt
the
people
we
care
about
at
the
end
of
the
day
taking
responsibility
for
our
decisions
and
actions
is
key
to
our
personal
development
it
instills
self confidence
and
self empowerment
and
can
help
free
us
from
the
regrets
of
the
past
and
lead
us
confidently
on
our
path
to
a
better
future

i

to

this
thought
is
daunting
because
i
am
aware
of
the
financial
and
personal
commitments
such
a
choice
will
require
growing
up
my
parents
have
always
supported
my
academic
pursuits
and
inspired
me
to
strive
for
excellence
they
ve
worked
hard
to
make

i

distance
learning
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
option
for
students
as
technology
has
improved
and
educators
have
embraced
it
it
offers
several
unique
benefits
compared
to
traditional
classroom
learning
such
as
greater
flexibility
lower
costs
and
access
to
a
larger
variety
of
courses
for
some
students
distance
learning
can
be
a
more
attractive
option
because
it
provides
greater
autonomy
students
can
create
their
own
study
and
work
routines
and
work
at
their
own
pace
they
also
have
increased
access
to
resources
such
as
online
discussion
forums
chat
rooms
and
webinars
other
students
may
find
traditional
classroom
learning
to
be
the
better
option
face to face
interaction
with
teachers
and
classmates
can
provide
a
sense
of
support
and
community
that
distance
learning
does
not
traditional
classrooms
also
typically
have
more
course
options
and
greater
access
to
hands on
learning
experiences
such
as
field
trips
and
extracurricular
activities
ultimately
the
choice
between
distance
learning
and
traditional
classroom
learning
will
depend
on
the
individual
student
s
needs
and
preferences
each
option
has
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
so
researching
the
two
and
conducting
a
thorough
comparison
is
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
a
student
chooses
the
best
option
for
them
and
achievement
are
closely
connected
as
one
heavily
influences
the
other
an
individual
with
high
self esteem
believes
they
are
capable
of
succeeding
in
different
areas
of
life
often
resulting
in
demonstrable
achievements
on
the
other
hand
achieving
success
can
boost
an
individual
s
self esteem
high
self esteem
increases
motivation
as
individuals
with
a
greater
sense
of
self worth
are
more
eager
and
willing
to
face
challenges
and
take
on
more
difficult
tasks
in
pursuit
of
their
goals
furthermore
having
confidence
in
one
s
ability
to
achieve
can
lead
to
increased
resilience
when
faced
with
failure
instead
of
backing
down
from
a
challenge
individuals
with
higher
self esteem
are
more
likely
to
persevere
and
continue
to
strive
for
success
when
it
comes
to
success
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
research
shows
that
a
positive
attitude
is
linked
to
motivation
optimism
higher
self confidence
and
better
performance
all
of
which
are
key
components
necessary
for
achieving
success
a
positive
attitude
can
earn
respect
from
others
making
it
easier
to
build
relationships
and
strengthen
support
networks
that
can
lead
to
further
success
in
contrast
having
a
negative
attitude
can
be
detrimental
to
success
in
life
a
negative
attitude
can
lead
to
low
self esteem
feeling
overwhelmed
and
a
lack
of
motivation
all
of
which
can
impede
success
though
it
may
be
suggested
that
attitude
does
not
have
an
effect
on
success
research
clearly
proves
otherwise
it
is
impossible
to
achieve
success
without
having
a
positive
attitude
fostering
a
positive
attitude
can
allow
individuals
to
find
joy
and
inspiration
in
life
paving
the
way
for
positive
thinking
and
successful
outcomes
therefore
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
success
in
life
most
students
prefer
working
in
groups
to
working
alone
for
a
plethora
of
reasons
working
in
groups
allows
for
a
pooling
of
resources
including
materials
and
data
as
well
as
input
and
feedback
for
complex
tasks
pooling
knowledge
among
various
team
members
can
provide
enriched
solutions
that
may
not
be
possible
when
working
alone
working
in
groups
can
allow
for
the
division
and
delegation
of
responsibilities
which
can
significantly
reduce
the
workload
for
each
individual
team
member
however
working
in
groups
can
also
present
its
own
set
of
challenges
for
example
coordinating
schedules
to
meet
for
the
project
can
be
difficult
and
individual
personalities
may
present
obstacles
to
collaboration
and
cohesion
and
contrasting
working
in
groups
to
working
alone
reveals
both
pros
and
cons
while
working
in
groups
has
numerous
benefits
it
is
not
always
the
best
choice
for
every
situation
working
alone
can
provide
the
space
to
focus
on
a
task
and
may
allow
quicker
completion
of
a
task
however
it
can
be
difficult
to
gather
resources
and
data
without
additional
help
ultimately
it
s
important
to
evaluate
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
working
in
groups
or
alone
to
determine
which
choice
is
best
for
completing
the
task
successfully
currently
our
school
days
end
at
however
our
school
board
has
proposed
extending
the
school
day
by
hours
to
extending
the
school
day
will
bring
a
multitude
of
benefits
to
our
students
staff
and
overall
school
community
for
our
students
a
longer
school
day
will
provide
more
time
to
explore
coursework
in
greater
depth
while
the
average
school
day
allows
us
to
cover
the
required
material
extended
hours
would
offer
greater
opportunities
for
debate
exploration
and
discussion
allowing
students
to
develop
a
more
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
subjects
they
are
learning
in
addition
collective
learning
activities
such
as
group
projects
and
creative
problem solving
could
be
addressed
in
more
detail
with
additional
learning
time
from
a
longer
school
day
our
teachers
will
benefit
from
having
more
time
to
run
meaningful
activities
and
lessons
while
still
allowing
for
classes
to
keep
shorter
schedules
having
an
extra
hours
of
class
time
would
provide
teachers
with
the
opportunity
to
create
and
implement
more
imaginative
and
reflective
tasks
to
foster
the
students
academic
progress
moreover
this
would
create
an
environment
where
teachers
and
students
could
engage
in
more
effective
dialogue
and
collaboration
regarding
their
learning
activities
finally
the
whole
school
community
can
benefit
from
this
proposal
as
students
would
have
more
time
to
work
on
their
studies
our
school
s
academic
performance
would
improve
reflecting
positively
on
the
overall
success
of
our
institution
longer
school
day
would
also
leave
more
time
for
additional
activities
such
as
mentoring
and
extracurricular
activities
which
could
further
improve
school
morale
and
engagement
thus
giving
users
the
chance
to
interact
with
peers
in
a
variety
of
tasks
and
situations
in
conclusion
extending
the
school
day
by
hours
would
bring
a
positive
advantage
to
students
teachers
and
our
school
s
community
at
large
our
students
would
benefit
from
additional
time
to
explore
and
discuss
their
coursework
our
teachers
will
benefit
from
more
time
to
implement
innovative
lessons
and
finally
the
entire
school
community
would
have
improved
academic
performance
achievement
and
overall
satisfaction
in
recent
years
many
businesses
have
adopted
a
four day
work
week
with
ten
hour
days
this
model
raises
an
interesting
question
for
schools
would
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
provide
any
benefits
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
consider
when
it
comes
to
a
longer
school
day
from
a
student
s
perspective
more
school
time
holds
potential
clerical
benefits
having
two
extra
hours
every
day
would
mean
more
time
to
complete
difficult
topics
or
extra curricular
activities
such
as
sports
music
or
art
additionally
longer
days
would
provide
more
opportunities
for
engaging
in
school
culture
with
peers
creating
a
holistic
learning
environment
a
two hour
longer
school
day
however
could
also
have
a
few
drawbacks
longer
school
day
could
be
tiring
demotivating
and
overwhelming
for
some
students
leading
to
burnout
and
deteriorating
academic
performance
it
may
also
be
challenging
for
parents
to
find
childcare
coverage
for
these
extended
hours
which
could
especially
be
a
problem
for
single parent
households
for
schools
an
extended
school
day
provides
a
great
opportunity
to
provide
students
with
more
valuable
learning
experiences
schools
could
offer
a
wider
variety
of
courses
and
extra curricular
activities
having
access
to
more
resources
and
training
for
teachers
at
the
same
time
schools
should
consider
budget
implications
of
hiring
additional
staff
and
the
logistical
implications
of
providing
transportation
for
later
hours
while
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
for
a
two hour
longer
school
day
to
be
beneficial
for
students
and
schools
there
are
also
potential
drawbacks
such
as
fatigue
financial
implications
and
logistical
challenges
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
the
thought
of
extending
the
school
day
by
minutes
can
be
a
difficult
one
to
consider
for
both
students
and
teachers
alike
on
one
hand
it
could
be
beneficial
to
dedicate
more
time
for
in depth
conversations
in
the
classroom
and
allow
more
time
for
teachers
to
go
over
complex
concepts
additionally
it
could
also
give
students
more
opportunity
to
ask
questions
and
get
help
from
their
peers
and
teachers
however
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
detrimental
to
students
and
teachers
alike
having
to
stay
in
school
for
an
additional
half
an
hour
can
tire
out
both
teachers
and
students
leading
to
lack
of
motivation
and
a
decrease
in
concentration
also
this
could
lead
to
a
decrease
in
extracurricular
activities
or
have
to
begin
them
even
earlier
thus
diminishing
an
important
part
of
the
school
day
for
students
at
the
end
of
the
day
extending
the
school
day
by
minutes
can
have
both
its
benefits
and
drawbacks
before
making
any
solid
commitment
to
this
it
is
important
to
consider
the
opinions
of
both
the
teachers
and
the
students
as
the
ramifications
to
this
decision
are
far reaching
pharmacists
are
vital
healthcare
professionals
who
are
responsible
for
managing
the
distribution
of
medication
and
providing
advice
and
expertise
on
the
appropriate
use
of
drugs
pharmacists
must
have
a
of
degree
from
an
accredited
college
of
pharmacy
as
well
as
a
state
pharmacy
license
pharmacists
earn
an
average
of
a
year
depending
on
their
experience
and
the
state
they
work
in
outlook
for
pharmacists
is
expected
to
grow
faster
than
the
average
of
all
other
occupations
over
the
next
years
making
it
a
stable
and
reliable
career
option
excerpt
when
schools
choose
students
careers
for
them
before
they
reach
the
age
of
making
the
choice
themselves
the
impact
on
the
students
can
be
far reaching
and
profound
without
the
opportunity
to
make
a
decision
of
their
own
free
will
teenagers
will
have
limited
control
over
their
own
future
this
can
lead
to
decreased
engagement
in
their
academic
pursuits
feelings
of
powerlessness
and
insecurity
and
impair
their
ability
to
explore
interests
that
may
lie
outside
of
the
predetermined
options
furthermore
this
practice
may
lead
to
greater
levels
of
stress
and
anxiety
for
students
as
they
are
expected
to
perform
in
an
unfamiliar
area
without
having
chosen
it
for
themselves
ultimately
when
schools
control
students
careers
it
can
prevent
them
from
fully
expressing
their
own
individuality
and
achieving
their
full
potential

i
am
writing
to
suggest
a
unique
field
trip
opportunity
for
students
to
visit
a
s
locations
the
goal
of
this
field
trip
would
be
to
illustrate
the
consequences
of
not
receiving
an
education
the
field
trip
experience
would
start
with
a
presentation
by
a
s
representative
discussing
the
importance
of
receiving
an
education
students
would
then
be
able
to
observe
members
of
the
s
staff
at
work
and
gain
an
understanding
of
the
complexity
of
the
jobs
involved
the
benefits
of
this
experience
are
threefold
firstly
it
could
serve
as
a
wake up
call
for
young
people
to
stay
in
school
and
pursue
their
education
secondly
it
may
provide
insight
into
a
different
type
of
career
path
than
the
traditional
academic
route
thirdly
the
field
trip
would
enable
students
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
how
the
fast
food
industry
functions
you
for
considering
my
proposal
i
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
sincerely
your
name
the
importance
of
being
successful
in
life
versus
being
a
failure
depends
on
how
an
individual
defines
success
lies
in
achieving
and
maintaining
it
while
failure
involves
giving
up
or
not
being
able
to
meet
the
standards
of
success
hard
work
and
dedication
are
the
most
important
qualities
needed
in
order
to
be
successful
to
prevent
failing
in
life
one
must
set
realistic
goals
and
make
sure
to
create
a
plan
to
achieve
it
even
after
failing
one
can
capitalize
on
past
mistakes
and
become
successful
again
by
learning
from
them
however
staying
successful
all
the
time
comes
with
its
own
set
of
challenges
it
can
be
difficult
to
remain
humble
and
maintain
that
same
level
of
success
additionally
one
should
be
aware
that
complacency
can
lead
to
a
downward
spiral
of
failure
therefore
to
remain
successful
it
is
important
to
remain
aware
of
one
s
surroundings
and
adjust
according
to
new
challenges
the
idea
of
graduating
high
school
in
three
years
instead
of
four
is
becoming
more
popular
among
students
as
it
offers
many
potential
advantages
passing
classes
and
completing
requirements
in
three
years
instead
of
four
can
give
students
a
leg up
in
college
or
employment
allowing
them
to
be
ahead
of
the
game
and
start
early
taking
advantage
of
the
extra
year
they
could
explore
their
options
and
decide
their
career
paths
with
more
certainty
however
there
are
potential
drawbacks
to
graduating
early
as
well
it
is
important
for
students
to
make
sure
they
have
a
thorough
grasp
of
the
material
and
really
understand
the
curriculum
in
order
to
be
adequately
prepared
for
college
or
entering
the
workforce
for
this
reason
parents
may
have
concerns
about
their
children
graduating
early
and
not
having
enough
time
to
gain
a
solid
foundation
the
long term
effects
and
overall
implications
of
graduating
high
school
early
must
also
be
considered
when
it
comes
to
having
a
job
while
attending
school
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
on
the
one
hand
having
a
job
can
help
pay
for
educational
costs
provide
essential
work
experience
teach
responsible
money
management
and
increase
networking
opportunities
on
the
other
hand
a
job
can
make
it
difficult
to
juggle
academics
and
extracurricular
activities
lead
to
burnout
and
detract
from
academic
focus
the
ability
to
pay
for
educational
costs
is
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
of
having
a
job
while
in
school
with
tuition
fees
housing
and
other
expenses
the
costs
of
attending
college
can
be
overwhelming
and
employment
offers
a
way
to
relieve
this
pressure
while
also
providing
the
opportunity
to
build
a
professional
track
record
having
a
job
during
school
can
also
provide
essential
work
experience
even
if
the
job
does
n t
directly
relate
to
a
student
s
field
of
study
it
can
help
build
employability
skills
like
communication
problem solving
and
attention
to
detail
working
while
in
school
also
teaches
responsible
money
management
as
students
must
learn
how
to
manage
their
income
budget
and
expenses
last
but
not
least
working
can
increase
the
student
s
network
by
offering
them
the
chance
to
meet
people
they
may
not
encounter
in
the
classroom
unfortunately
there
are
a
few
disadvantages
that
come
with
a
job
while
in
school
it
can
be
difficult
to
keep
up
with
classes
studying
and
other
commitments
while
also
working
this
can
lead
to
burnout
and
fatigue
which
can
hurt
the
student
s
academic
performance
working
too
much
can
also
interfere
with
extracurricular
activities
and
make
it
difficult
to
stay
socially
connected
to
friends
or
campus
life
lastly
having
a
job
can
contribute
to
a
student
s
already
overloaded
attention
reducing
their
ability
to
focus
on
their
studies
in
conclusion
having
a
job
while
in
school
has
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
any
college
student
considering
it
must
be
aware
of
both
with
the
right
balance
and
planning
a
job
can
provide
many
benefits
such
as
financial
relief
work
experience
financial
skills
and
network
building
while
its
disadvantages
can
be
minimized
is
an
important
part
of
a
healthy
and
happy
life
it
allows
us
to
confidently
face
challenges
be
resilient
in
the
face
of
difficulties
and
trust
in
our
abilities
is
particularly
key
in
developing
successful
relationships
as
it
provides
us
with
the
ability
to
make
meaningful
connections
with
others
without
sufficient
self esteem
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
most
of
our
lives
real
achievement
can
help
improve
self esteem
since
it
allows
us
to
connect
with
our
goals
and
regain
confidence
in
ourselves
when
we
make
meaningful
progress
towards
a
goal
it
is
an
important
reminder
that
we
are
capable
and
capable
of
great
things
in
this
way
real
achievement
helps
to
boost
our
self esteem
and
give
us
the
confidence
to
tackle
new
challenges
the
opinions
of
others
can
affect
our
self esteem
in
the
digital
age
it
is
all
too
easy
to
compare
ourselves
to
others
this
can
lead
to
a
deep
sense
of
inadequacy
if
we
judge
ourselves
harshly
in
comparison
to
others
it
is
important
that
we
take
the
time
to
reflect
on
our
own
goals
and
celebrate
our
progress
we
should
try
not
to
be
overly
influenced
by
the
opinions
of
others
and
keep
our
focus
on
the
progress
we
have
made
ultimately
the
key
to
better
self esteem
lies
in
being
ourselves
when
we
are
our
true
selves
and
remain
authentic
it
is
easier
to
take
ownership
of
our
successes
and
be
proud
of
ourselves
being
yourself
is
about
giving
yourself
the
freedom
to
be
exactly
who
you
are
without
worrying
what
the
world
thinks
of
you
with
this
freedom
comes
increased
self esteem
allowing
you
to
make
the
most
of
your
life
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
essential
ingredient
to
success
in
life
a
positive
outlook
on
challenges
can
lead
to
more
opportunities
improved
friendships
and
better
health
for
example
in
the
workplace
a
positive
attitude
can
open
up
networking
possibilities
due
to
the
impression
of
confidence
it
leaves
on
employers
in
a
social
environment
friends
may
respond
more
positively
when
they
encounter
an
attitude
that
embraces
life
rather
than
a
negative
outlook
that
may
attract
less
desirable
company
finally
research
has
shown
that
both
mental
and
physical
health
can
improve
with
a
positive
attitude
people
who
think
positively
often
recover
from
illness
or
stress
faster
it
is
important
to
think
positively
because
of
the
benefits
it
can
bring
a
positive
attitude
can
improve
motivation
which
in
turn
leads
to
success
thinking
positively
helps
to
reach
goals
and
encourages
problem
solving
which
can
lead
to
more
creative
solutions
positive
thinking
also
increases
self confidence
and
optimism
both
of
which
are
integral
to
success
and
self belief
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
is
an
essential
component
to
achieving
success
in
life
it
can
open
up
possibilities
and
increase
motivation
while
a
positive
attitude
does
not
guarantee
success
it
can
provide
the
mental
and
emotional
strength
to
keep
going
when
times
are
tough
therefore
by
maintaining
a
positive
mindset
one
can
increase
their
chances
of
achieving
success
in
different
areas
of
life
is
a
hotly
debated
topic
with
strong
arguments
on
both
sides
on
one
side
many
people
argue
that
honesty
is
always
the
best
policy
they
point
to
examples
such
as
the
importance
of
developing
trust
in
relationships
companies
and
governments
also
shows
respect
for
others
by
being
honest
we
demonstrate
that
we
recognize
and
value
their
feelings
considerations
and
rights
the
consequences
of
not
being
honest
can
also
be
significant
people
often
experience
feelings
of
guilt
deceit
and
shame
resulting
from
dishonesty
leading
to
a
sense
of
internal
unrest
on
the
other
side
of
the
debate
some
claim
that
there
can
be
drawbacks
to
being
too
honest
this
could
include
the
potential
for
hurting
others
feelings
or
causing
distress
due
to
being
overly
blunt
excessively
honest
could
also
strain
relationships
damage
one
s
reputation
and
create
an
environment
of
mistrust
ultimately
the
debate
of
whether
honesty
is
the
best
policy
continues
both
sides
bring
valid
points
to
the
conversation
and
when
making
decisions
it
can
be
helpful
to
weigh
both
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
after school
homework
club
provides
a
valuable
opportunity
for
students
to
develop
academically
and
socially
it
allows
students
to
take
initiative
in
their
education
as
they
take
part
in
organizing
the
club
s
activities
and
events
work
together
in
small
groups
and
communicate
with
each
other
in
order
to
get
help
and
advice
additionally
the
club
can
be
a
great
motivator
as
the
environment
encourages
students
to
stay
on
top
of
their
work
three
reasons
to
support
the
opening
of
an
after school
homework
club
are
as
follows
firstly
an
after school
homework
club
provides
a
supportive
setting
for
students
to
work
in
and
provides
an
opportunity
for
students
to
receive
help
from
one
another
with
experienced
adults
on
hand
the
club
can
also
offer
guidance
on
how
to
approach
problems
and
foster
a
collaborative
atmosphere
that
allows
students
to
ask
for
advice
and
receive
feedback
in
return
secondly
it
not
only
helps
with
schoolwork
but
offers
the
chance
for
personal
growth
the
club
encourages
developing
problem
solving
abilities
organizational
skills
and
increases
communication
skills
through
meeting
with
peers
and
discussing
notes
finally
an
after school
homework
club
offers
a
unique
opportunity
for
students
to
socialize
with
their
peers
in
a
setting
outside
of
the
classroom
this
allows
them
to
develop
relationships
in
a
setting
without
a
grade
at
stake
as
well
as
having
fun
when
working
collaboratively
on
projects
these
three
reasons
are
bolstered
by
the
fact
that
an
after school
homework
club
offers
a
unique
environment
to
focus
exclusively
in
study
and
practice
access
to
more
resources
for
help
the
opportunity
to
reach

is
an
invaluable
tool
that
could
help
students
to
achieve
their
full
academic
potential
when
it
comes
to
learning
new
things
many
of
us
feel
overwhelmed
at
the
thought
of
taking
on
something
unfamiliar
however
if
approached
with
the
right
tools
and
resources
learning
something
new
can
open
up
a
range
of
opportunities
one
practical
example
is
that
of
who
decided
to
learn
coding
to
enable
her
to
create
a
digital
platform
to
help
develop
her
community
with
the
help
of
online
resources
and
mentors
was
able
to
take
her
project
from
concept
to
completion
with
bigger
projects
it
is
helpful
to
enlist
the
help
of
another
person
or
group
to
ensure
everything
runs
as
smoothly
as
possible
it
s
also
important
to
consider
the
consequences
of
not
doing
something
for
example
not
taking
the
time
to
learn
how
to
code
may
have
limited
s
ability
to
bring
her
project
to
life
finally
it
s
essential
to
accept
help
whenever
it
is
needed
don
t
forget
that
it
s
to
ask
for
assistance
when
it
comes
to
new
endeavors
with
the
right
support
learning
new
things
can
open
up
a
world
of
possibilities
the
school
is
committed
to
promoting
a
clean
and
vibrant
community
and
encouraging
students
to
contribute
to
it
to
reinforce
this
commitment
every
student
will
be
required
to
perform
community
service
in
order
to
keep
the
community
clean
the
plan
will
consist
of
five
components
students
will
be
encouraged
to
volunteer
for
community
service
activities
as
part
of
clubs
and
other
parts
of
the
school
curriculum
a
set
of
guidelines
and
resources
will
be
created
to
help
students
safely
and
effectively
participate
in
community
service
activities
students
will
receive
awards
for
participating
in
community
service
activities
a
community
service
fund
will
be
established
to
provide
additional
resources
for
students
finally
any
student
who
does
not
complete
the
necessary
community
service
will
be
subject
to
remedial
action
such
as
suspension
or
expulsion
these
five
components
form
the
foundation
of
the
plan
to
require
every
student
to
perform
community
service
in
order
to
keep
the
community
clean
growing
up
my
parents
instilled
in
me
at
an
early
age
the
importance
of
authenticity
and
honesty
from
a
young
age
i
learned
that
if
i
choose
to
be
truthful
and
honest
i
will
likely
make
wiser
decisions
in
life
and
build
better
relationships
this
made
me
understand
the
importance
of
setting
boundaries
and
being
comfortable
with
saying
no
something
that
is
still
valuable
to
me
today
throughout
my
life
i
ve
experienced
many
people
who
were
dishonest
and
inauthentic
trying
to
fit
in
and
please
these
people
was
a
mistake
as
they
only
brought
me
down
and
it
was
not
the
healthy
environment
that
i
needed
to
grow
and
succeed
with
more
experience
under
my
belt
i
eventually
became
better
at
recognizing
bad
relationships
and
toxic
people
i
discovered
that
the
more
i
was
honest
about
who
i
was
the
easier
it
was
for
me
to
be
surrounded
by
positive
individuals
who
pushed
me
to
reach
my
goals
and
dreams
overall
personal
growth
and
development
starts
with
understanding
the
importance
of
being
honest
and
authentic
in
life
setting
boundaries
and
not
putting
up
with
toxic
people
is
the
best
way
to
make
wiser
healthier
relationships
in
the
long
run
we
have
the
ability
to
choose
who
we
invest
our
time
in
and
i
have
learned
that
it
s
better
to
choose
wisely
having
the
courage
to
step
outside
of
one
s
comfort
zone
and
venture
into
the
unknown
can
be
terrifying
and
intimidating
but
it
can
also
be
incredibly
rewarding
however
going
too
far
beyond
our
existing
knowledge
can
be
overwhelming
leading
to
more
difficulty
in
achieving
our
goals
while
pushing
boundaries
is
important
for
growth
sometimes
we
can
learn
more
by
staying
within
our
capability
and
experimenting
from
there
taking
on
something
we
know
can
help
build
confidence
and
hone
our
abilities
in
areas
we
are
already
familiar
with
this
may
involve
perfecting
an
existing
skill becoming
a
virtuoso
on
the
guitar
for
example or
just
exploring
all
the
possibilities
that
already
exist
with
the
tools
we
already
possess
working
within
the
realms
of
one
s
comfort
zone
can
also
help
jog
creative
juices
allowing
us
to
come
up
with
new
ideas
and
perspectives
we
may
not
have
seen
before
ultimately
whether
we
re
trying
something
new
or
mastering
the
things
we
already
know
both
enable
us
to
progress
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
we
are
constantly
learning
whether
that
involves
taking
on
something
completely
unfamiliar
or
not
each
journey
big
or
small
can
help
us
to
move
forward
even
if
we
choose
to
stay
close
to
home
in
recent
years
student
population
growth
in
the
states
has
put
tremendous
strain
on
educational
institutions
leading
to
overcrowded
classrooms
and
overburdened
teachers
this
has
made
distance
learning
an
attractive
option
for
many
students

the
convenience
of
learning
from
home
but
it
can
present
challenges
such
as
a
lack
of
communication
between

the
difficulty
of
administering
student
assessment

the
pros
and
cons

school
and
learning
from
home
attending

at
school
provides
a
physical
space
for

taking
classes
from
home
allows
for
more
flexibility
in
terms
of
scheduling
and
the
ability
to
learn
at
one
s
own
pace
the
outbreak
of
the
has
forced
educational
institutions
to
abruptly
shift
to
distance
learning
although
distance
learning
can
offer
the
flexibility
and
convenience
of
learning
from

it
can
also
present
challenges
such
as
difficulties
in
assessing
students
performance
and
lack
of
communication
between
instructors
and
students

of

beneficial
to
them
in

is
less
about
knowing
exactly
what
you
want
to
do
and
more
about
setting
a
goal
knowing
that
they
are
working
towards
a
specific

passionate
about

often
find
ourselves
with
more
free
time
to
pursue
hobbies
and
activities
we
enjoy
and
to
take
risks
having
the
freedom
to
do
so

a
greater
sense
of
joy
and
allows

growing
up
i
was
incredibly
lucky
to
have
both
an
amazing
set
of
parents
and
teacher
who
placed
a
great
emphasis
on
setting
and
achieving
goals
they
not
only
taught
me
to
think
outside
the
box
and
develop
resilience
in
reaching
my
goals
but
the
importance
of
hard
work
and
determination
no
matter
how
challenging
a
goal
may
seem
one
particular
example
of
this
was
when
i
set
out
to
complete
my
university
degree
it
was
an
incredibly
challenging
process
full
of
hard
work
and
dedication
but
i
ultimately
achieved
it
thanks
to
the
strong
foundation
of
support
from
my
parents
and
teacher
since
then
setting
goals
has
become
a
part
of
my
everyday
life
with
each
goal
getting
progressively
harder
and
pushing
my
boundaries
to
ensure
i
continuously
grow
and
develop
my
current
objective
is
to
become
a
successful
entrepreneur
to
achieve
this
goal
i
plan
to
use
the
knowledge
and
skills
i
have
been
taught
by
my
parents
and
teacher
along
with
the
skills
and
experience
i
have
gained
through
my
university
degree
additionally
i
plan
to
remain
proactive
in
discovering
new
tools
trends
and
strategies
that
will
help
guide
me
along
this
journey
recent
studies
have
shed
light
on
the
significant
influence
of
role
models
on
individuals
in
particular
teenagers
are
likely
to
take
cues
from
those
admired
figures
which
can
affect
their
behavior
and
the
environment
around
them
famous
and
influential
public
figures
have
always
existed
and
with
the
rise
of
social
media
their
impact
has
become
even
more
tangible
one
noteworthy
example
of
a
positive
role
model
was
the
civil
rights
activist
whose
decision
to
remain
seated
on
a
segregated
bus
back
in
sparked
a
national
movement
that
drew
the
attention
of
the
whole
world
her
courageous
stand
serves
as
an
inspiring
lesson
of
how
one
individual
can
make
a
difference
no
matter
the
odds
by
setting
a
positive
example
leaders
and
role
models
can
encourage
people
to
also
act
with
integrity
respect
inclusion
and
kindness
such
behaviors
can
have
a
ripple
effect
in
both
peer
groups
and
wider
environments
inspiring
a
movement
and
creating
meaningful
change
one
of
the
main
benefits
of
attending
physical
classes
rather
than
taking
classes
from
home
is
the
lack
of
distractions
available
classes
may
offer
a
feeling
of
convenience
but
without
a
physical
teacher
present
it
s
up
to
the
student
to
ensure
that
they
are
completely
focused
on
the
task
at
hand
it
can
be
difficult
to
stay
concentrated
in
a
comfortable
home
environment
particularly
when
distractions
such
as
television
the
internet
and
social
media
are
just
a
few
clicks
away
without
a
teacher
present
to
redirect
their
focus
onto
the
task
it
s
easy
for
students
to
get
sidetracked
and
miss
important
points
having
an
actual
teacher
to
ask
questions
of
and
receive
feedback
from
is
also
a
big
part
of
the
learning
process
in
a
classroom
setting
students
have
the
opportunity
to
ask
questions
in
real time
and
get
feedback
on
their
work
from
a
trained
professional
conversely
taking
classes
from
home
does
not
provide
the
same
level
of
opportunity
for
students
to
ask
questions
get
clarification
and
receive
immediate
feedback
on
completed
assignments
this
can
hamper
their
learning
by
limiting
their
understanding
of
the
material
and
preventing
them
from
getting
the
most
out
of
the
class
finally
attending
physical
classes
rather
than
taking
classes
from
home
also
provides
more
time
and
opportunity
to
learn
in
a
physical
class
students
are
able
to
take
advantage
of
lunch
recess
and
after school
programs
that
may
not
otherwise
be
possible
when
they
are
learning
from
home
this
additional
time
to
learn
allows
for
greater
comprehension
of
class
material
and
encourages
further
exploration
and
experimentation
with
concepts
overall
taking
classes
from
home
can
be
detrimental
to
student
learning
while
it
may
offer
some
level
of
convenience
physical
classes
allow
students
to
take
advantage
of
having
a
physical
teacher
to
ask
questions
of
immediate
feedback
on
their
work
and
additional
time
and
opportunity
to
learn
physical
classes
is
ultimately
the
better
choice
for
improving
their
learning
ability
vacations
provide
teens
with
a
unique
opportunity
to
take
a
break
from
the
normal
routine
of
the
academic
year
and
spend
more
time
with
their
friends
and
family
studies
have
found
that
longer
summer
vacations
have
many
benefits
such
as
providing
more
time
for
socialization
improving
mood
and
cognition
and
broadening
opportunities
for
exploration
and
discovery
additionally
longer
summer
vacations
can
help
strengthen
family
bonds
as
teens
are
able
to
spend
more
quality
time
with
their
parents
siblings
and
extended
family
however
there
are
potential
drawbacks
associated
with
longer
summer
vacations
teens
who
have
a
lengthy
amount
of
time
away
from
school related
activities
and
responsibilities
may
experience
a
drop
in
academic
performance
as
disruptive
behavior
can
manifest
from
boredom
without
the
structure
of
school
teens
may
also
fall
into
negative
habits
such
as
reckless
decision making
or
addiction
to
social
media
and
other
electronic
devices
in
conclusion
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
longer
summer
vacation
must
be
taken
into
consideration
by
families
if
planned
and
organized
in
concert
with
parents
and
school
staff
longer
summer
vacations
can
be
beneficial
for
teens
as
they
can
spend
more
time
with
their
family
and
friends
at
the
same
time
the
right
balance
of
structure
and
autonomy
should
be
observed
to
ensure
that
teens
can
make
the
most
of
their
time
away
from
school
the
proliferation
of
high
school
programs
that
allow
students
to
graduate
in
three
years
instead
of
four
has
presented
new
opportunities
for
students
to
accelerate
their
educational
course
and
potentially
further
their
future
employment
prospects
graduating
early
could
provide
students
with
more
time
to
pursue
college
or
to
join
the
workforce
and
it
could
lead
to
higher
earnings
or
more
promising
career
paths
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
few
drawbacks
to
graduating
early
students
may
be
less
prepared
to
take
on
higher
educational
or
career
challenges
if
they
have
n t
had
the
same
amount
of
time
to
pursue
their
educational
and
life
experiences
as
those
who
graduate
in
four
years
rigor
may
also
be
compromised
in
a
three
year
program
as
students
may
not
take
certain
subjects
or
have
the
same
experiences
with
their
peers
finally
there
may
not
be
the
same
support
offered
to
students
who
graduate
early
as
those
who
take
four
years
potentially
limiting
opportunities
ultimately
high
school
programs
that
allow
students
to
graduate
in
three
years
can
be
a
great
opportunity
for
some
but
there
are
some
risks
and
drawbacks
that
should
be
carefully
weighed
before
students
decide
to
commit
to
the
program
as
i
strive
to
be
successful
in
my
career
one
of
my
goals
is
to
achieve
and
maintain
a
high
paying
job
having
a
high
paying
job
can
lead
to
many
rewards
such
as
having
the
ability
to
travel
and
buy
something
without
worrying
about
using
family
money
it
can
also
give
people
the
opportunity
to
try
out
new
cuisines
with
expensive
food
items
having
a
high
paying
job
serves
as
a
gateway
to
a
world
of
options
for
travel
both
near
and
far
it
allows
people
to
see
new
countries
or
cities
explore
different
cultures
or
even
just
have
a
much
needed
relaxing
vacation
having
a
high
paying
job
means
that
the
only
limitations
to
travel
are
the
ones
you
set
for
you
can
afford
to
try
more
experiences
that
enrich
your
life
moreover
having
a
high
paying
job
allows
people
to
buy
what
they
need
or
want
without
worrying
about
the
cost
or
if
it
will
take
away
from
a
family
member
s
money
with
a
secure
job
with
a
steady
income
people
can
buy
the
things
they
need
and
even
splurge
on
items
it
also
gives
people
the
freedom
to
make
purchases
without
feeling
guilty
about
how
it
affects
their
loved
ones
in
conclusion
having
a
high
paying
job
is
worth
the
effort
and
it
offers
many
benefits
such
as
enabling
people
to
travel
and
buy
without
using
family
money
it
is
a
great
way
to
experience
the
world
s
cultures
and
make
a
secure
living
for
oneself
the
additional
minutes
of
school
each
day
could
have
a
major
impact
on
students
teachers
extracurricular
activities
and
families
students
alertness
and
academic
performance
could
be
affected
due
to
the
need
to
stay
mentally
present
for
a
longer
period
of
time
this
could
lead
to
fatigue
particularly
if
students
are
already
involved
in
after school
activities
or
have
an
extensive
homework
load
workload
could
also
be
affected
as
instructors
would
be
required
to
meet
the
needs
of
students
engaging
with
their
lesson
plans
longer
each
day
in
addition
extracurricular
activities
and
family
time
could
both
be
affected
if
students
have
less
time
available
for
other
interests
or
time
with
their
families
the
potential
impacts
of
an
additional
minutes
of
school
each
day
appear
to
be
mixed
while
it
may
be
beneficial
for
some
students
it
could
also
disrupt
the
lives
of
others
to
determine
if
this
is
an
effective
course
of
action
more
research
into
the
pros
and
cons
must
be
done
many
students
choose
to
graduate
early
from
high
school
for
a
variety
of
reasons
such
as
wanting
to
take
college
courses
or
begin
a
career
sooner
before
deciding
if
graduating
early
is
the
right
choice
it
is
important
for
students
and
parents
to
consider
both
the
pros
and
cons
one
of
the
key
requirements
for
graduating
early
is
taking
additional
courses
and
classes
doing
so
can
have
academic
consequences
such
as
missing
out
on
elective
courses
or
having
less
time
to
fully
explore
a
particular
subject
or
delve
into
extra
research
additionally
the
extra
classes
and
hours
of
study
could
potentially
place
a
strain
on
a
student
s
mental
health
and
academic
performance
when
weighing
the
merits
of
graduating
early
versus
staying
in
high
school
for
the
traditional
four
years
there
are
many
factors
to
consider
for
some
people
the
opportunities
available
with
an
early
graduation
may
outweigh
the
potential
drawbacks
while
for
others
it
may
be
preferable
to
stay
in
school
and
complete
all
four
years
plus
any
additional
classes
ultimately
an
informed
decision
is
best
before
making
the
choice
to
graduate
early
it
is
important
to
gather
as
much
information
as
possible
about
the
requirements
pros
cons
and
the
academic
and
mental
health
consequences
that
may
come
with
it
the
quote
from
the
essay
serves
to
illustrate
the
huge
importance
of
examples
and
money
in
influencing
others
for
instance
in
the
essay
the
author
cites
the
example
of
a
group
of
people
who
decided
to
raise
funds
for
charity
despite
their
genuine
cause
and
strong
motivation
they
had
a
hard
time
enticing
people
to
donate
to
their
cause
however
when
they
offered
small
rewards
such
as
chocolates
and
movie
tickets
individuals
decided
to
contribute
proving
that
offers
of
money
can
indeed
be
an
effective
way
to
get
people
to
act
both
using
an
example
and
offering
money
to
the
public
allowed
them
to
influence
others
and
garner
support
for
their
cause
this
example
perfectly
highlights
the
quote
s
notion
that
examples
and
money
are
the
only
influences
on
others
the
debate
over
whether
schools
should
control
their
students
involvement
in
extracurricular
activities
is
an
important
one
on
one
hand
it
is
beneficial
for
schools
to
regulate
and
monitor
students
extracurricular
involvement
as
it
allows
for
better
oversight
of
educational
institutions
as
a
whole
and
ensures
that
students
are
taking
part
in
activities
that
align
with
the
school
s
values
on
the
other
hand
some
believe
that
restricting
students
involvement
in
extracurricular
activities
can
stifle
creativity
and
expression
and
that
it
can
lead
to
feelings
of
burnout
and
resentment
in
order
to
find
the
best
solution
we
must
take
both
perspectives
into
consideration
on
the
one
hand
there
is
value
in
providing
guidelines
and
oversight
for
students
extracurricular
activities
so
that
students
remain
safe
and
get
the
most
out
of
their
activities
on
the
other
hand
an
overly
restrictive
environment
can
have
an
adverse
effect
as
students
may
feel
that
their
choices
are
limited
or
unfairly
controlled
therefore
it
is
essential
for
schools
to
focus
on
providing
students
with
guidance
and
advice
rather
than
strict
control
setting
positive
expectations
of
behavior
providing
meaningful
and
relevant
activities
and
mentors
and
making
sure
that
students
have
ample
time
for
rest
and
relaxation
are
all
important
components
of
introducing
an
effective
balance
between
school
life
and
extracurricular
activities
by
providing
clear
support
and
guidance
schools
can
ensure
that
their
students
get
the
most
out
of
their
extracurricular
experiences
while
managing
to
remain
safe
and
productive
in
recent
years
many
schools
around
the
world
have
seen
an
influx
of
students
for
whom
is
not
their
first
language
to
ensure
that
all
students
receive
an
equal
education
many
schools
have
implemented
programs
specifically
for
those
learning
as
a
second
language
these
kinds
of
programs
allow
students
to
not
only
gain
spoken
language
proficiency
but
also
work
on
reading
writing
and
other
language
skills
usually
classes
are
tailored
to
the
individual
needs
of
each
student
to
ensure
that
no
one
falls
behind
depending
on
the
program
students
may
also
be
able
to
participate
in
activities
in
their
native
language
such
as
culture
clubs
or
language
competitions
in
addition
many
english language
programs
at
schools
provide
both
native
and
non native
english
speakers
with
useful
resources
and
support
these
resources
may
range
from
a
library
of
material
in
multiple
languages
to
regular
tutoring
hours
to
workshops
that
help
young
students
acclimate
to
the
classroom
setting
by
providing
a
structured
supportive
learning
environment
for
those
learning
as
a
second
language
schools
are
able
to
ensure
that
all
students
have
access
to
a
quality
education
these
programs
provide
students
with
the
skills
and
resources
they
need
to
confidently
engage
with
their
peers
and
teachers
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
working
in
a
group
comes
with
clear
advantages
over
working
alone
while
it
can
be
tempting
to
go
it
alone
on
a
project
expertise
and
efficiency
are
much
better
achieved
when
working
with
a
team
for
example
collaborating
with
others
makes
it
easier
to
divide
the
work
and
to
complete
tasks
faster
additionally
the
benefits
of
having
access
to
different
perspectives
can
significantly
improve
the
accuracy
of
a
project
having
a
variety
of
opinions
also
helps
ensure
effective
problem solving
however
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
working
in
a
group
teammates
may
not
always
agree
on
how
to
proceed
or
handle
tough
decisions
moreover
conflicts
may
arise
and
disagreements
may
delay
progress
finally
interpersonal
dynamics
that
are
out
of
sync
can
lead
to
tension
in
the
office
in
conclusion
although
there
are
some
negatives
to
working
in
a
group
the
advantages
generally
outweigh
the
drawbacks
when
people
work
together
it
can
be
an
incredibly
powerful
source
of
creativity
talent
and
collaboration
that
can
drive
a
project
towards
successful
completion
one
of
the
benefits
of
having
a
four day
school
week
with
ten
hours
of
school
each
day
is
the
amount
of
time
students
would
have
for
outside
activities
and
enrichment
with
two
extra
days
per
week
free
from
having
to
attend
classes
students
would
have
the
opportunity
to
explore
interests
get
a
job
volunteer
or
participate
in
sports
or
extracurricular
activities
this
extra
free
time
could
result
in
increased
academic
performance
improved
mental
wellbeing
and
a
more
well rounded
student
body
on
the
other
hand
having
ten
hours
of
school
per
day
could
be
a
detriment
to
student
performance
students
would
be
required
to
focus
for
an
extended
period
of
time
which
may
not
be
conducive
to
learning
additionally
students
may
not
have
enough
outside
time
to
participate
in
activities
that
could
benefit
their
academic
performance
finally
students
may
not
be
able
to
find
childcare
for
these
additional
long
school
days
people
should
be
allowed
to
express
themselves
and
live
how
they
want
to
no
matter
what
society
or
the
world
might
think
everyone
has
their
own
unique
set
of
beliefs
backgrounds
and
experiences
that
contribute
to
who
they
are
and
how
they
view
the
world
suppressing
these
differences
is
not
only
detrimental
to
individual
identity
but
it
can
also
lead
to
feelings
of
frustration
insecurity
and
even
depression
when
we
allow
people
to
express
themselves
it
gives
them
the
freedom
to
express
their
opinions
ideas
and
feelings
it
promotes
a
shared
understanding
and
respect
for
diversity
and
acceptance
we
can
use
this
respect
to
create
a
more
diverse
and
equitable
world
more
importantly
allowing
people
to
express
themselves
encourages
a
sense
of
autonomy
and
pride
in
themselves
this
allows
people
to
embrace
their
differences
and
be
comfortable
in
their
own
skin
living
how
you
want
to
and
having
the
confidence
and
courage
to
express
yourself
freely
can
help
to
foster
greater
self esteem
and
a
strong
sense
of
identity
in
a
world
where
conformity
is
often
rewarded
more
than
individuality
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
importance
of
allowing
people
to
express
themselves
and
live
how
they
want
to
it
promotes
respect
for
diversity
and
encourages
people
to
embrace
their
differences
and
be
true
to
themselves
this
sense
of
self expression
and
freedom
is
essential
for
creating
a
positive
accepting
environment
for
all
having
a
positive
attitude
is
a
key
factor
in
leading
a
successful
and
happy
life
it
allows
us
to
look
for
opportunities
in
challenging
times
to
find
joy
in
simple
pleasures
to
remain
resilient
during
difficult
periods
and
to
cultivate
relationships
with
those
around
us
with
a
positive
outlook
we
have
the
ability
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
grow
from
them
take
on
life
s
adversities
with
courage
and
find
joy
in
the
small
moments
having
a
positive
attitude
brings
mental
strength
to
our
lives
it
allows
us
to
remain
optimistic
and
put
setbacks
in
perspective
having
a
positive
outlook
in
life
gives
us
the
drive
to
keep
going
in
spite
of
adversity
by
using
our
creativity
and
resourcefulness
with
a
positive
attitude
we
can
stay
motivated
and
inspired
to
continue
to
reach
our
goals
having
a
positive
attitude
can
also
have
physical
benefits
studies
have
shown
that
positive
thinking
reduces
stress
increases
our
physical
health
boosts
our
immune
system
and
can
even
help
us
to
achieve
our
dreams
with
a
positive
attitude
we
can
focus
on
the
good
things
in
life
we
can
practice
gratitude
and
take
moments
to
appreciate
the
beauty
in
the
world
having
a
positive
attitude
is
a
choice
one
we
make
every
day
it
requires
effort
and
dedication
we
must
work
on
developing
a
constructive
mindset
and
shift
away
from
negativity
with
practice
we
can
learn
to
be
kinder
to
ourselves
and
cultivate
a
positive
attitude
which
can
have
a
massive
impact
on
our
lives
having
a
positive
attitude
can
bring
a
greater
sense
of
satisfaction
and
contentment
and
it
can
lead
to
a
more
successful
and
happy
life
plays
a
major
role
in
achieving
success
in
all
aspects
of
life
it
is
the
foundation
we
use
to
make
progress
and
move
forward
even
when
faced
with
failure
as
the
old
saying
goes
where
there
s
a
will
there
s
a
way
this
is
why
it
s
so
important
to
stay
passionate
no
matter
what
life
throws
at
us
without
enthusiasm
we
become
easily
discouraged
we
may
give
up
too
easily
in
the
face
of
challenges
or
tell
ourselves
that
things
are
too
hard
this
is
why
it
s
important
to
remember
that
enthusiasm
is
a
major
influence
on
our
motivation
it
can
make
the
difference
between
giving
up
and
pushing
through
as
the
great
philosopher
once
said
we
are
what
we
repeatedly
do
excellence
then
is
not
an
act
but
a
habit
this
emphasizes
the
importance
of
forming
the
right
habits
and
having
the
right
attitude
in
order
to
reach
our
goals
in
addition
being
enthusiastic
also
boosts
our
confidence
it
is
said
that
enthusiasm
is
contagious
and
attracts
the
same
level
of
enthusiasm
from
others
this
means
that
having
enthusiasm
for
something
can
make
others
more
likely
to
help
us
achieve
our
goals
furthermore
enthusiasm
is
an
important
tool
to
help
us
over
come
difficult
times
and
stay
positive
no
matter
what
happens
knowing
that
we
have
the
enthusiasm
to
keep
moving
forward
is
empowering
ultimately
enthusiasm
is
key
to
achieving
our
goals
we
should
never
give
up
in
the
face
of
failure
and
instead
embrace
the
challenges
that
come
with
pursuing
success
our
enthusiasm
is
what
will
drive
us
to
never
give
up
and
eventually
reach
our
goals
the
world
of
business
management
contains
a
complexity
few
appreciate
from
the
outside
looking
in
from
the
prudent
decision maker
to
the
larger than life
manager
those
at
the
helm
of
a
business
face
a
bevy
of
responsibilities
complexities
and
pressures
a
successful
manager
must
understand
the
financial
human
and
organizational
responsibilities
necessary
for
a
business
to
thrive
while
also
being
able
to
adapt
operations
to
the
changing
business
environment
the
pressures
placed
on
a
manager
range
from
long
hours
and
difficult
decisions
to
managing
in
a
volatile
economic
setting
those
who
understand
the
importance
of
guidance
delegation
and
strived
for
high
standards
often
find
the
greatest
success
it
is
also
critical
that
business
managers
be
conscious
of
their
responsibility
and
commitment
to
those
they
manage
while
also
understanding
the
consequences
of
poor
management
decisions
by
understanding
the
responsibilities
and
pressures
placed
on
those
in
business
management
as
well
as
being
willing
to
commit
to
the
essential
strategies
required
for
a
business
to
flourish
a
manager
can
equip
themselves
to
handle
any
business
environment
by
adhering
to
their
commitment
and
responsibility
to
their
business
a
manager
can
ensure
a
successful
outcome
there
are
various
pros
and
cons
when
it
comes
to
taking
a
day
off
from
school
on
one
hand
students
and
teachers
may
find
a
break
from
their
often
demanding
schedules
to
be
beneficial
for
overall
energy
and
stress
levels
in
addition
taking
a
break
from
classes
can
help
conserve
resources
such
as
electricity
as
schools
can
reduce
overall
energy
costs
by
not
providing
regular
teaching
and
studying
for
one
day
however
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
taking
one
day
off
of
school
on
the
student
side
taking
off
could
cause
them
to
fall
behind
on
their
curriculum
and
potentially
create
gaps
in
their
learning
additionally
teachers
have
to
manage
the
complexities
of
making
sure
everyone
stays
on
track
with
their
curriculum
and
could
find
additional
time
off
to
be
challenging
overall
deciding
whether
or
not
to
take
one
day
off
of
school
is
a
difficult
choice
that
needs
to
be
carefully
considered
while
taking
a
break
may
be
beneficial
for
some
others
may
find
it
detrimental
ultimately
it
really
comes
down
to
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
taking
one
day
off
of
school
work
is
an
essential
part
of
life
it
can
have
real
beneficial
effects
on
many
aspects
of
life
from
school
projects
to
career
success
through
group
work
members
of
a
team
can
all
learn
from
one
another
and
help
the
progress
of
the
project
i
have
experienced
the
positives
of
working
in
a
group
firsthand
in
high
school
i
worked
with
several
of
my
classmates
on
a
large
research
paper
working
together
gave
us
access
to
our
teachers
expertise
as
well
as
the
chance
to
apply
our
individual
skill
sets
to
a
collective
problem
we
applied
our
strengths
and
weaknesses
to
the
task
resulting
in
a
well crafted
piece
of
work
that
would
have
been
much
harder
to
achieve
by
ourselves
another
instance
in
which
i
experienced
the
benefits
of
group
work
was
during
my
college
internships
when
working
on
large
projects
such
as
web
designs
and
software
development
i
found
that
the
combination
of
the
creative
ideas
generated
by
our
diverse
team
led
to
the
highest
quality
results
furthermore
each
teammate
had
different
specialized
skills
that
contributed
to
the
final
product
all
of
which
i
was
able
to
learn
from
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
working
in
a
group
can
bring
many
benefits
not
only
can
members
learn
from
one
another
but
also
each
person
s
individual
strengths
can
be
combined
to
create
results
that
could
not
have
been
achieved
on
their
own
from
my
own
personal
experience
i
can
say
that
the
importance
and
benefits
of
working
in
a
group
can
not
be
overstated
setting
a
good
example
for
others
is
a
powerful
way
to
influence
their
behavior
when
we
take
responsibility
for
our
own
actions
demonstrate
honesty
and
show
respect
for
those
around
us
those
qualities
can
begin
to
proliferate
among
our
peers
this
can
be
especially
useful
when
working
in
a
team
and
can
help
create
an
environment
where
everyone
can
learn
and
grow
moreover
setting
an
example
has
the
potential
to
have
a
ripple
effect
if
we
take
the
time
to
lead
by
example
we
can
encourage
others
to
lead
by
example
as
well
creating
a
sense
of
shared
responsibility
and
a
stronger
sense
of
community

this
project
your
group
will
explore
a
science
or
math
topic
related
to
animals
facts
and
information
about
the
topic
and
work
together
as
a

an
important
part
of

programs
are
made
possible

create
meaningful
and
lasting
connections
between
individuals
organizations
and
the

of
camaraderie
and
ownership
but
it
also
empowers
people
to
take
an
active
role
in
the
betterment
of
their
communities
one
example
of
the
powerful
effect
community
service
has
on
events
is
the
annual
of
every
year
volunteers
travel
to
neighborhoods
in
need
and
tackle
projects
such
as
landscaping
painting
houses
and
helping
local
nonprofits
with
various
activities
this
event
and
countless
others
like
it
not
only
beautify
areas
of
the
community
but
also
send
a
powerful
message
of
purpose
and
hope
in
addition
to
events
community
service
can
also
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
long term
health
of
the
community
many
volunteering
opportunities
are
focused
on
engaging
with
local
youth
providing
them
with
educational
and
developmental
resources
they
may
not
otherwise
have
access
to
this
helps
to
create
a
better
future
for
the
upcoming
generation
and
can
trigger
a
ripple
effect
of
growth
throughout
the
community
in
conclusion
community
service
is
important
to
the
community
because
it
not
only
creates
short term
events
and
initiatives
for
the
community
to
enjoy
but
it
is
also
a
means
of
providing
lasting
change
for
future
generations
through
volunteerism
we
are
empowered
to
make
a
real
difference
in
our
communities
and
positively

the
world
around
us
s
story
is
an
inspiring
one
he
rose
from
a
tumultuous
childhood
and
poverty
to
become
a
successful
entrepreneur
stockbroker
and
author
despite
facing
numerous
personal
and
professional
challenges
he
managed
to
stay
on
top
of
his
studies
he
put
in
the
work
to
earn
his
degree
in
business
administration
he
credited
his
strong
will
to
stay
in
school
and
have
a
better
life
as
a
key
factor
in
his
success
thanks
to
s
relentless
determination
and
hard
work
he
was
able
to
break
barriers
within
the
world
of
banking
and
finance
he
became
the
owner
of
his
own
brokerage
firm
and
went
on
to
lead
a
successful
life
he
wrote
numerous
books
and
appeared
in
major
films
magnifying
his
reach
and
inspiring
others
s
journey
of
resilience
serves
a
source
of
inspiration
to
many
he
was
a
living
testament
that
one
can
rise
above
the
circumstances
of
their
life
and
achieve
success
against
all
odds
had
a
great
impact
on
society
and
his
story
will
continue
to
be
a
source
of
hope
and
inspiration
extract
the
school
principal
s
decision
to
require
all
students
to
participate
in
an
extracurricular
activity
is
misguided
not
only
is
it
unfair
to
those
who
may
not
have
the
resources
or
the
inclination
to
take
part
but
it
can
also
be
detrimental
to
those
same
students
by
forcing
them
to
take
part
in
an
activity
they
may
not
be
interested
in
or
have
the
time
or
resources
to
participate
in
the
students
are
more
likely
to
experience
feelings
of
helplessness
and
disconnection
from
their
peers
leading
to
higher
levels
of
stress
and
dissatisfaction
furthermore
this
decision
could
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
academic
performance
of
these
students
rather
than
using
extracurricular
activities
to
engage
student
interest
the
school
principal
should
be
investing
in
programs
and
initiatives
aimed
at
supporting
students
who
may
have
challenges
in
the
classroom
many
education
experts
agree
that
elective
classes
are
a
great
way
for
students
to
experience
something
outside
of
the
traditional
curriculum
and
to
hone
skills
that
will
help
them
in
the
future
for
example
taking
classes
in
the
arts such
as
drama
music
and
creative
writing can
open
up
avenues
for
expression
and
collaboration
electives
can
also
help
students
develop
new
skills
such
as
in
the
areas
of
business
programming
and
engineering
however
there
is
a
downside
to
requiring
students
to
take
electives
some
students
may
not
take
the
class
seriously
as
they
may
view
it
as
an
optional
class
rather
than
one
that
is
necessary
for
their
success
there
s
also
the
issue
of
finding
electives
that
meet
the
interests
and
abilities
of
the
student
as
well
as
ones
that
fit
well
with
the
overall
curriculum
ultimately
it
is
up
to
schools
and
educators
to
choose
the
right
electives
for
students
that
will
help
equip
them
with
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
in
today
s
competitive
world
providing
students
with
the
freedom
to
explore
different
interests
and
passions
through
elective
classes
is
essential
for
long term
success
and
growth
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
was
determined
to
get
a
full time
job
for
the
summer
in
order
to
save
up
money
for
college
it
took
hard
work
and
dedication
but
i
eventually
found
a
job
as
a
cashier
in
a
local
grocery
store
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
n t
the
most
glamorous
job
i
showed
up
to
work
on
time
hit
my
goals
and
even
worked
extra
shifts
my
hard
work
and
determination
paid
off
in
the
end
not
only
did
i
save
enough
money
for
college
but
i
also
gained
valuable
work
experience
and
earned
the
admiration
of
my
supervisors
who
promoted
me
to
a
managerial
position
this
experience
taught
me
the
power
of
hard
work
and
determination
no
matter
how
big
or
small
the
goal
might
be
so
long
as
i
stay
focused
stay
determined
and
work
hard
to
make
it
happen
i
know
i
can
achieve
greatness
living
an
active
lifestyle
is
incredibly
important
for
both
individuals
and
societies
alike
physically
active
individuals
have
stronger
physical
and
mental
health
increased
longevity
and
exhibit
personality
traits
linked
to
higher
levels
of
well being
for
societies
physical
activity
reduces
healthcare
costs
associated
with
chronic
diseases
and
increases
productivity
for
individuals
an
active
lifestyle
can
help
to
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
chronic
diseases
improve
mental
health
reduce
anxiety
and
depression
and
improve
overall
quality
of
life
studies
have
shown
that
physical
activity
can
also
help
to
boost
mood
increase
self esteem
and
increase
energy
level
regular
aerobic
exercise
improves
cardiovascular
health
and
lowers
blood
pressure
and
resistance
training
helps
to
build
strength
and
muscular
endurance
at
the
societal
level
physical
activity
reduces
healthcare
costs
associated
with
chronic
diseases
such
as
obesity
diabetes
and
heart
disease
also
boosts
productivity
as
it
helps
to
reduce
the
number
of
days
missed
from
work
due
to
illness
or
injury
as
well
as
reduces
the
cost
of
employee
healthcare
active
individuals
also
contribute
to
a
healthier
and
more
productive
environment
as
they
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
activities
such
as
volunteering
and
have
involvement
in
their
community
it
is
clear
that
living
an
active
lifestyle
is
important
for
both
individuals
and
society
and
that
the
benefits
of
engaging
in
regular
physical
activity
are
vast
we
should
all
strive
to
add
more
activity
into
our
daily
lives
in
order
to
reap
the
countless
physical
mental
and
social
benefits
after school
programs
have
proven
to
be
a
powerful
way
to
help
younger
students
succeed
in
school
in
such
programs
older
students
help
younger
students
with
school related
tasks
such
as
homework
projects
and
study
preparation
the
benefits
of
these
programs
can
be
seen
in
improved
understanding
of
tasks
enhanced
time
management
and
improved
social
skills
several
educational
facilities
have
already
established
such
after school
programs
which
often
involve
a
large
number
of
students
in
addition
to
helping
to
complete
traditional
school
tasks
these
programs
present
students
with
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
a
variety
of
educational
and
recreational
activities
based
on
the
data
collected
from
existing
programs
it
is
proposed
that
a
more
comprehensive
organized
after school
program
should
be
implemented
this
program
would
provide
students
with
the
necessary
support
and
resources
to
succeed
academically
it
could
also
offer
students
the
chance
to
be
mentored
by
more
experienced
peers
allowing
them
to
gain
real world
knowledge
while
having
fun
at
the
same
time
excerpt
organizing
your
work
is
a
key
element
of
productive
writing
before
you
start
your
project
it
is
important
to
brainstorm
ideas
jot
them
down
on
paper
and
then
research
the
topic
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
what
is
needed
from
there
create
a
plan
to
keep
track
of
your
progress
and
set
deadlines
for
yourself
to
ensure
that
the
work
is
completed
on
time
furthermore
once
the
work
is
finished
take
a
step
back
and
proofread
on
paper
before
submitting
for
final
review
the
idea
of
adding
an
extra
hour
or
a
half
hour
to
the
school
day
is
one
that
many
parents
and
students
have
considered
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
this
idea
that
must
be
taken
into
account
before
jumping
to
conclusions
on
the
one
hand
an
extra
hour
of
schooling
could
lead
to
improvements
in
educational
outcomes
such
as
higher
grades
increased
knowledge
and
better
test
scores
on
the
other
hand
the
additional
time
in
school
could
lead
to
stress
and
exhaustion
for
students
as
well
as
a
longer
day
cut
into
family
time
it
is
understandable
why
parents
and
students
may
be
against
this
change
adding
an
extra
hour
to
the
school
day
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
homework
which
may
seem
unfair
for
those
already
struggling
with
coursework
additionally
having
to
extend
their
day
may
be
too
much
for
students
who
have
extracurricular
activities
either
after
school
or
on
the
weekend
in
order
to
make
sure
that
everyone
s
voice
counts
when
it
comes
to
this
decision
representatives
from
the
school
teachers
and
parents
should
meet
and
discuss
the
issue
affected
by
the
change
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
express
their
opinion
before
the
decision
is
made
all
opinions
should
be
taken
into
consideration
and
a
process
should
be
put
in
place
to

i
recall
my
freshman
year
of
college
when

was
struggling
academically

personal
issues
and
other
challenges
it
felt
like
giving
up
was
the
only
option

knew
deep
down
that
i
had
to
push
through
it
and
be
courageous
in
order
to
reach
my
goals
instead
of
giving
up
i
decided
to
start
studying
more
consistently
look
for
support
and
guidance
from
professors
and
build
strong
relationships
with
a
close
group
of
friends
i
eventually
got
back
on
track
and
was
able
to
perform
better
in
my
academics
it
was
not
an
easy
or
quick
fix
but
the
courage
i
had
to
continue
on
changed
my
path
towards
success
s
wise
words
still
echo
in
my
head
and
motivate
me
every
day
whether
it
s
with
my
academic
goals
or
personal
goals
i
always
remind
myself

n t
final

from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
to
me

reflects
his
commitment
to
achieving
victory
in
times
of
adversity

to
remain
resilient
having
a
good
attitude
allows
us
to
enjoy
life
more
and
to
make
the
most
out
of
any
situation
it
encourages
us
to
explore
new
opportunities
and
take
risks
furthermore
it
can
help
us
to
build
stronger
relationships
with
ourselves
as
well
as
with
others
when
we
have
a
positive
outlook
it
is
easier
to
forgive
and
it
can
help
reduce
stress
ultimately
attitude
serves
as
a
resource
for
resilience
in
both
life
s
good
times
and
its
difficult
moments
it
is
a
tool
that
we
can
draw
on
to
bring
out
our
best
a
good
attitude
can
support
us
in
achieving
our
goals
no
matter
how
insurmountable
they
may
seem
it
is
essential
to
have
a
positive
outlook
and
approach
life
with
a
good
attitude
when
it
comes
to
personal
development
and
success
there
is
often
a
need
to
make
a
choice
between
being
productive
and
being
idle
being
productive
is
linked
to
developing
new
strengths
talents
and
abilities
that
can
lead
to
greater
success
in
life
by
working
hard
and
pushing
yourself
to
go
above
and
beyond
you
can
develop
the
skills
and
knowledge
needed
to
be
successful
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
being
idle
and
taking
a
break
from
work
can
be
just
as
beneficial
taking
a
step
back
provides
an
opportunity
for
self reflection
and
rejuvenation
enabling
you
to
find
clarity
focus
and
inner
peace
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
individual
to
decide
which
approach
is
best
suited
to
their
current
situation
but
both
being
productive
and
being
idle
can
lead
to
personal
growth
and
success
when
discussing
why
teachers
should
let
any
student
participate
in
school
sports
or
activities
it
is
important
to
consider
the
potential
benefits
students
may
gain
from
their
involvement
many
students
with
lower
grades
may
benefit
from
developing
essential
skills
such
as
teamwork
cooperation
and
self confidence
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
lower
grades
do
not
always
reflect
a
student
s
true
skills
or
level
of
competency
participating
in
activities
can
also
give
students
an
outlet
to
engage
in
social
activities
make
friends
and
stay
active
in
order
to
help
students
with
lower
grades
be
successful
in
such
activities
it
is
important
for
teachers
to
provide
support
and
create
an
environment
that
encourages
student
success
this
could
include
scheduling
extra
study
time
with
the
student
before
they
participate
in
the
activity
creating
individualized
learning
strategies
and
connecting
the
student
with
a
mentor
who
can
work
with
them
once
students
are
set
with
reasonable
expectations
and
resources
they
can
be
provided
with
the
opportunity
to
develop
and
grow
their
skills
in
a
safe
supportive
environment
working
in
a
team
or
group
can
be
beneficial
in
certain
environments
or
activities
while
individual
work
may
be
preferable
in
others working
as
part
of
a
group
provides
the
opportunity
to
benefit
from
the
knowledge
and
expertise
of
each
person
in
the
group
allowing
for
greater
creativity
and
productivity
on
the
other
hand
when
working
as
part
of
a
group
disagreements
and
delays
may
occur
which
could
impede
progress
and
lead
to
tensions
within
the
group
working
alone
gives
one
the
independence
and
freedom
to
choose
their
own
course
of
action
this
ensures
that
tasks
will
be
completed
according
to
one
s
preference
and
timeframe
however
working
alone
can
also
lead
to
feelings
of
isolation
and
potential
stagnation
as
one
person
may
lack
the
resources
and
knowledge
to
tackle
complex
projects
in
conclusion
it
is
important
to
assess
the
task
at
hand
before
making
a
decision
on
whether
to
work
individually
or
as
part
of
a
group
both
have
their
benefits
and
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
individual
or
group
to
decide
which
setup
will
lead
to
the
most
success
the
importance
of
being
a
responsible
and
hard working
employee
can
not
be
overstated
a
young
employee
who
researches
successful
people
and
works
hard
to
achieve
their
goals
improves
their
chances
of
leaving
an
excellent
record
at
their
job
this
is
of
particular
value
because
excellent
records
can
be
the
difference
between
getting
a
job
and
being
overlooked
an
individual
who
fails
to
take
being
responsible
and
hard
working
in
a
job
seriously
may
face
the
consequences
of
not
following
rules
which
can
lead
to
disciplinary
action
and
even
job
termination
additionally
taking
on
challenging
tasks
and
being
reliable
can
create
a
reputation
that
will
open
doors
for
future
job
opportunities
and
promotions
ultimately
it
is
worth
working
hard
and
being
responsible
in
any
job
because
it
builds
character
and
provides
a
greater
sense
of
satisfaction
and
fulfillment
the
current
educational
system
in
the
is
largely
unchanged
since
the
century
with
students
generally
attending
school
five
days
per
week
from
to
recently
some
school
districts
have
proposed
altering
this
system
by
implementing
a
four day
school
week
with
an
extended
two
hours
each
day
while
such
a
system
could
have
several
advantages
including
reduced
overhead
costs
and
improved
morale
for
teachers
and
students
it
could
also
cause
students
to
miss
out
on
curriculum
that
may
be
important
to
attaining
their
academic
goals
additionally
it
could
increase
the
burden
for
parents
who
would
be
responsible
for
finding
alternative
care
for
their
children
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
school
week
ultimately
any
decision
to
implement
a
four day
school
week
with
extended
days
must
weigh
the
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
against
the
potential
impacts
it
would
have
on
student
achievement
i
am
incredibly
excited
for
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
company
and
learn
more
about
the
job
with
six
years
of
experience

some
of
the
top

companies
in
the
country
leading
award winning

and
strive
to
make
it
the
best
it
can
be
i
believe
this
enthusiastic
approach
is
necessary
for
success
in
any
production
team
my
past
successes
in
tv
production
prove
that
passion
combined
with
skill
can
go
a
long
way
i
believe
that
my
experience
and
enthusiasm
make
me
an
ideal
candidate
to
visit
the
company
and
learn
more
about
the
job
i
am
confident
that
i
could
exceed
expectations
by
using
my
experience
and
passion
to
create
unique
engaging
content
as
the
head
of
our
student
body
i
am
writing
to
urge
you
to
consider
allowing
our
school
to
make
a
visit
to
your
hospital
having
an
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
healthcare
and
medicine
in
a
real world
setting
would
be
an
invaluable
learning
experience
for
students
of
all
ages
we
believe
that
a
trip
to
your
hospital
would
provide
students
with
an
important
understanding
of
the
importance
of
medical
care
and
a
first hand
look
at
how
hospitals
work
is
becoming
increasingly
important
in
this
day
and
age
with
advances
in
medical
technology
and
new
ways
of
tackling
serious
health
conditions
making
the
field
more
exciting
than
ever
by
visiting
your
hospital
our
students
would
have
the
chance
to
understand
the
magnitude
of
the
healthcare
industry
and
gain
a
better
appreciation
for
the
work
done
by
those
in
the
medical
profession
the
trip
would
also
allow
our
students
to
experience
what
it
s
really
like
to
be
a
patient
in
a
hospital
and
would
open
their
eyes
to
the
realities
of
the
health
care
system
by
visiting
your
hospital
our
students
would
gain
valuable
insight
into
the
complexities
of
medical
care
learn
about
the
importance
of
healthcare
and
gain
a
more
informed
view
of
the
medical
field
what
s
more
they
would
gain
knowledge
that
they
can
apply
to
their
own
studies
and
have
an
opportunity
to
explore
a
new
field
in
a
safe
and
secure
environment
we
hope
that
you
will
consider
allowing
our
school
to
make
a
visit
to
your
hospital
such
an
experience
would
be
an
incredibly
enriching
experience
for
our
students
and
one
that
they
would
benefit
from
for
years
to
come
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
being
true
to
yourself
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
you
can
do
both
for
yourself
and
for
those
around
you
it
s
about
being
honest
with
yourself
and
other
people
and
being
genuine
in
all
aspects
of
life
when
we
pretend
to
be
something
we
re
not
the
consequences
are
serious
and
can
cause
lasting
damage
to
our
relationships
with
others
and
our
own
wellbeing
it
can
cause
us
to
feel
inauthentic
and
untrue
to
ourselves
creating
confusion
and
doubts
about
our
own
determine
life
paths
on
the
other
hand
being
ourselves
allows
us
to
be
fully
accepted
and
understood
by
the
people
in
our
lives
we
can
openly
express
who
we
really
are
no
matter
how
seemingly
small
when
we
do
this
we
can
start
to
establish
long
lasting
meaningful
connections
and
relationships
with
other
people
we
can
also
learn
how
to
respect
and
value
our
own
opinions
and
perspectives
instead
of
constantly
worrying
about
what
others
think
ultimately
being
true
to
yourself
is
essential
to
our
wellbeing
and
to
our
relationships
it
helps
to
create
authenticity
which
is
something
that
should
not
be
taken
lightly
being
genuine
comes
from
within
and
it
can
only
be
expressed
externally
when
we
are
also
true
to
ourselves
we
must
embrace
our
authentic
selves
and
take
the
courage
to
express
them
to
others
phones
have
been
increasingly
recognized
as
an
important
teaching
tool
in
the
classroom
to
better
understand
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
allowing
students
to
use
cell
phones
in
the
classroom
it
is
important
to
look
at
recent
research
in
this
area
several
studies
have
shown
that
when
used
in
moderation
cell
phones
can
be
an
effective
tool
for
teaching
certain
academic
topics
for
example
the
use
of
quick
response
codes
to
access
educational
materials
has
been
found
to
improve
student
engagement
and
comprehension
of
material
on
the
other
hand
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
can
also
be
seen
as
a
distraction
as
constantly
checking
messages
and
social
media
can
be
distracting
for
both
students
and
teachers
to
address
this
issue
it
is
essential
for
teachers
to
set
some
ground
rules
from
the
start
allowing
students
to
use
cell
phones
sparingly
for
specific
academic
tasks
can
ensure
they
stay
focused
on
their
studies
teachers
should
also
make
sure
there
is
an
understanding
amongst
students
that
cell
phone
use
is
intended
for
academic
purposes
and
not
for
recreational
activities
such
as
social
media
or
texting
friends
by
enforcing
clear
policies
and
enforcing
consequences
cell
phone
use
in
the
classroom
can
become
a
beneficial
tool
for
educators
and
students
alike
growing
up
in
a
close knit
family
i
was
taught
very
early
on
the
importance
of
responsibility
hard work
reliability
and
the
importance
of
working
well
with
others
my
parents
always
made
sure
that
i
was
able
to
help
out
around
the
house
with
chores
and
errands
while
making
sure
that
i
was
able
to
excel
in
my
studies
i
was
taught
life
lessons
about
the
value
of
these
qualities
through
the
examples
that
were
set
by
my
parents
and
siblings
one
of
my
favorite
life
lessons
came
in
high
school
when
i
had
to
stay
up
late
to
study
for
a
major
test
at
first
i
was
tired
and
wanted
to
give
up
but
my
parents
encouraged
me
to
push
through
and
i
ended
up
doing
very
well
on
the
exam
this
experience
taught
me
the
value
of
effort
and
how
no
matter
how
difficult
a
task
is
i
can
achieve
success
if
i
work
hard
and
do
n t
give
up
this
simple
lesson
has
remained
with
me
ever
since
and
continues
to
motivate
me
to
strive
for
success
in
all
areas
of
life
including
this
potential
job
opportunity
after
researching
the
effects
of
a
school
program
that
pairs
older
and
younger
students
i
ve
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
program
is
beneficial
for
both
parties
the
older
students
gain
invaluable
experience
in
teaching
and
leadership
while
the
younger
students
benefit
from
the
guidance
support
and
encouragement
of
their
elder
peers
i
remember
participating
in
this
type
of
pairing
program
in
middle
school
younger
partner
and
i
would
work
together
to
complete
class
assignments
although
our
age
difference
was
noticeable
i
was
impressed
by
how
quickly
he
learned
and
observed
that
having
someone
close
to
his
own
age
to
relate
to
and
look
up
to
made
a
real
difference
in
his
attitude
and
performance
the
advantages
of
this
program
go
beyond
academic
success
it
emphasizes
the
importance
of
kindness
and
cooperation
and
exposes
each
child
to
a
different
age
group
and
mindset
most
importantly
it
is
a
reminder
to
both
parties
that
everyone
has
something
to
contribute
no
matter
how
different
they
may
be
research
has
shown
that
offering
classes
online
can
have
numerous
advantages
and
disadvantages
depending
on
the
situation
for
students
who
do
not
have
access
to
the
internet
online
classes
can
be
difficult
for
them
to
participate
in
and
succeed
with
as
they
do
not
have
access
to
the
same
resources
as
their
peers
additionally
students
who
lack
the
responsibility
to
stay
focused
in
online
classes
may
struggle
to
keep
up
with
their
work
lastly
students
who
are
easily
distracted
in
the
home
environment
may
not
be
able
to
remain
focused
on
their
courseload
if
there
are
external
factors
that
could
limit
their
productivity
despite
these
potential
issues
online
classes
can
be
a
great
opportunity
for
those
who
have
the
necessary
tools
to
succeed
those
with
internet
access
can
enjoy
the
flexibility
of
having
classes
anytime
and
anywhere
allowing
them
to
work
at
their
own
pace
online
classes
can
help
to
bridge
different
cultures
across
the
globe
creating
a
more
diverse
learning
environment
in
conclusion
offering
classes
online
can
be
an
extremely
advantageous
choice
for
those
with
the
necessary
resources
and
motivation
however
it
is
important
to
consider
the
challenges
that
students
may
face
if
access
to
the
internet
or
having
a
productive
workspace
is
limited
it
is
important
for
educators
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
obstacles
that
students
may
face
in
order
to
help
them
succeed
in
an
online
learning
environment
first
impressions
are
powerful
we
all
know
that
first
impressions
are
often
hard
to
change
and
can
often
lead
to
inaccurate
assumptions
made
about
a
person
s
character
and
habits
the
reality
is
however
that
first
impressions
can
and
often
do
change
over
time
for
example
consider
two
strangers
who
meet
for
the
first
time
the
initial
impression
one
has
of
the
other
is
usually
based
mostly
on
physical
appearance
and
even
the
briefest
of
interactions
however
as
time
goes
on
if
these
two
strangers
share
more
interactions
and
get
to
know
each
other
better
the
initial
impressions
they
had
of
each
other
can
and
do
change
even
something
as
simple
as
a
conversation
or
a
shared
interest
can
lead
to
drastically
different
vies
of
each
other
to
further
illustrate
this
consider
the
workplace
environment
it
is
not
unusual
for
individuals
to
develop
better
relationships
with
their
colleagues
and
supervisors
over
time
initially
someone
may
have
a
less
than
stellar
view
of
their
coworkers
or
boss
however
once
an
extended
period
of
interactions
has
passed
the
relationship
and
overall
impression
of
each
other
can
change
for
the
better
in
conclusion
first
impressions
may
be
hard
to
change
but
it
is
possible
with
enough
effort
positive
interactions
and
time
it
is
definitely
possible
to
alter
one
s
initial
views
of
another
failure
is
a
fundamental
part
of
the
human
experience
it
s
through
failure
that
we
learn
grow
and
ultimately
succeed
as
put
it
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
in
other
words
failure
is
what
helps
us
move
forward
and
ultimately
become
successful
failure
can
provide
a
wealth
of
knowledge
with
each
mistake
or
loss
comes
a
valuable
lesson
if
we
look
closely
at
our
failures
we
can
see
what
went
wrong
anticipate
potential
obstacles
in
future
projects
and
take
steps
to
correct
them
we
can
also
become
more
resilient
by
addressing
our
mistakes
head on
and
developing
new
skills
and
strategies
for
the
future
this
process
of
trial
and
error
can
lead
to
discovering
new
and
innovative
solutions
to
problems
and
achieving
success
failures
can
also
provide
direction
to
our
interests
and
goals
when
we
experience
a
setback
we
can
focus
on
what
we
have
learned
and
use
it
to
redirect
ourselves
to
our
goals
knowing
what
doesn
t
work
makes
it
easier
to
pinpoint
what
does
as
we
continue
our
journey
we
more
easily
recognize
patterns
of
success
and
apply
them
to
other
areas
of
our
lives
failure
should
not
be
feared
but
instead
embraced
by
acknowledging
failure
and
learning
from
its
mistakes
we
can
develop
the
courage
and
fortitude
to
continue
striving
for
success
as
said
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
courage
helps
us
continue
to
foster
and
grow
our
strengths
acknowledge
and
shift
our
weaknesses
and
ultimately
become
successful
growing
up
with
an
older
brother
i
gained
a
perspective
on
competition
that
motivates
me
to
this
day
having
to
compete
with
him
for
everything
from
the
latest
video
games
to
admissions
to
the
best
universities
i
learned
that
in
order
to
succeed
i
had
to
be
competitive
to
be
competitive
i
needed
release
my
passion
and
put
my
all
into
achieving
my
goals
it
helped
me
to
understand
the
importance
of
setting
goals
and
taking
risks
in
order
to
achieve
them
and
my
desire
to
become
a
pro
basketball
player
is
a
prime
example
of
this
my
experience
of
competing
against
my
brother
not
only
fostered
my
competitive
spirit
but
also
taught
me
how
to
channel
it
effectively
i
learned
to
set
realistic
goals
challenge
myself
and
stay
focused
on
the
task
at
hand
i
found
that
i
was
able
to
stay
motivated
and
make
the
best
use
of
the
resources
available
i
also
learned
the
importance
of
collaboration
as
sometimes
even
an
individual
can
only
go
so
far
without
the
help
of
others
the
importance
of
being
competitive
can
not
be
overstated
having
a
competitive
attitude
can
propel
an
individual
to
success
in
any
field
and
it
can
also
help
foster
collaboration
it
is
important
for
those
who
are
competitive
to
ensure
that
they
remain
humble
and
respectful
as
well
as
understand
the
importance
of
cooperation
by
understanding
this
concept
and
knowing
how
to
effectively
channel
competitive
spirit
i
am
able
to
apply
it
to
my
day to day
life
competitive
is
essential
in
order
to
reach
personal
and
professional
goals
and
i
hope
that
others
will
be
able
to
learn
from
my
experiences
in
recent
years
the
topic
of
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
has
become
increasingly
contested
on
the
one
hand
proponents
of
the
extended
day
point
to
its
potential
to
reduce
energy
consumption
and
resource
use
the
theory
is
that
fewer
buildings
would
be
needed
in
order
to
accommodate
the
maximum
number
of
students
in
each
school
district
and
as
a
result
energy
and
resources
would
be
conserved
on
the
other
hand
opponents
of
the
extended
day
suggest
that
there
could
be
many
potential
costs
and
inconveniences
for
students
parents
and
society
longer
school
days
could
lead
to
burnout
exhaustion
and
a
lack
of
balance
in
students
lives
and
parents
may
struggle
to
fit
in
work
and
family
obligations
in
the
extended
schedule
in
addition
there
could
be
costs
in
terms
of
expenses
for
busing
larger
classrooms
and
more
teachers
having
considered
both
sides
of
this
argument
i
believe
that
while
the
potential
benefits
of
an
extended
school
day
could
be
considerable
the
risks
and
inconveniences
to
all
stakeholders
could
be
too
great
should
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
such
a
move
carefully
before
implementing
such
a
drastic
change
ultimately
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
decisions
made
about
the
school
day
need
to
be
tailored
to
best
suit
the
needs
of
the
student
body
the
parents
and
the
school
itself
from
the
life
stories
of
successful
people
it
is
clear
that
believing
in
oneself
and
receiving
support
from
family
are
two
key
components
to
reaching
success
a
great
example
of
this
is
the
author
of
the
series
before
becoming
a
successful
author
rowling
found
herself
struggling
with
job
insecurity
poverty
and
even
depression
despite
these
challenges
rowling
doggedly
fought
for
her
goal
of
becoming
a
published
author
and
she
eventually
achieved
great
success
this
is
an
example
of
why
failure
should
not
be
considered
a
sign
or
a
reason
to
give
up
rather
failure
can
be
a
part
of
the
success
journey
a
short term
setback
that
can
serve
as
a
learning
experience
or
help
to
refine
goals
and
strategies
it
is
also
important
to
mention
the
supportive
role
that
families
can
play
in
one
s
journey
to
success
whether
it
is
emotional
support
advice
resources
or
all
of
the
above
family
support
is
an
important
factor
in
the
success
equation
to
summarize
in
order
to
be
successful
it
is
essential
to
have
a
strong
belief
in
oneself
and
to
have
the
support
of
family
through
dedication
hard
work
and
resilience
success
can
be
attained
even
in
the
face
of
failure
and
challenges
the
importance
of
having
a
good
attitude
is
often
overlooked
yet
it
has
a
significant
effect
on
our
lives
having
a
positive
outlook
can
lead
to
greater
success
as
it
can
give
us
the
motivation
and
enthusiasm
to
take
on
challenges
and
better
our
lives
when
faced
with
difficulties
people
who
have
good
attitudes
are
better
equipped
to
cope
and
take
responsibility
for
their
lives
studies
have
shown
that
a
good
attitude
can
increase
one
s
chances
of
getting
a
job
or
being
accepted
into
college
having
good
attitudes
can
also
result
in
gaining
self respect
confidence
and
respect
from
others
all
of
which
are
essential
for
becoming
successful
in
life
having
a
poor
attitude
can
lead
to
negative
and
counterproductive
results
such
as
loss
of
self esteem
loss
of
friends
or
potential
opportunities
and
a
lack
of
willingness
to
take
on
challenges
and
responsibilities
in
conclusion
maintaining
a
good
attitude
is
essential
for
success
it
not
only
increases
one
s
chances
of
finding
a
job
or
getting
into
college
but
it
is
also
a
vital
way
to
achieve
self respect
and
respect
from
others
having
a
positive
outlook
and
being
willing
to
take
on
challenges
are
key
components
of
gaining
success
and
can
ultimately
be
the
difference
between
achieving
our
goals
and
having
our
dreams
deferred
the
use
of
cellphones
in
classrooms
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
student
performance
on
the
one
hand
it
can
allow
students
to
quickly
access
information
and
stay
connected
with
their
peers
to
facilitate
group
work
additionally
the
use
of
an
educational
app
or
online
platform
can
help
improve
engagement
in
the
classroom
on
the
other
hand
if
not
properly
regulated
the
use
of
cellphones
can
lead
to
distractions
and
can
prevent
better
concentration
on
the
lesson
furthermore
the
proliferation
of
smartphones
can
lead
to
issues
of
cyberbullying
and
phubbing
which
can
negatively
impact
student
mood
and
attitude
in
sum
while
cellphones
can
be
beneficial
in
terms
of
access
to
information
and
resources
it
is
important
that
clear
rules
and
proper
regulation
are
implemented
in
order
to
achieve
an
optimal
learning
environment
the
concept
of
success
is
often
dependent
on
an
individual
s
willingness
to
embrace
failure
as
part
of
the
journey
while
failure
can
be
discouraging
at
times
it
s
important
to
remember
that
setbacks
can
lead
to
new
insights
and
opportunities
for
growth
enthusiasm
can
also
play
a
key
role
in
success
motivating
us
to
keep
going
when
we
face
a
challenge
to
prevent
failure
and
stay
on
track
with
our
goals
it
s
important
to
keep
our
enthusiasm
and
focus
on
the
journey
not
just
the
destination
we
should
also
strive
to
stay
organized
breaking
down
our
tasks
into
smaller
achievable
goals
and
celebrating
our
progress
along
the
way
finally
it
s
important
to
keep
perspective
and
practice
self care making
sure
we
prioritize
balance
and
take
the
time
to
rest
and
recharge
with
the
right
attitude
and
perseverance
success
is
just
within
reach
distance
learning
has
become
increasingly
more
popular
in
recent
years
as
technology
has
allowed
us
to
create
innovative
learning
experiences
that
can
be
accessed
from
almost
anywhere
in
the
world
by
comparison
traditional
in class
learning
is
done
within
a
confined
physical
environment
limiting
both
student
accessibility
and
teaching
capabilities
therefore
distance
learning
can
provide
a
number
of
advantages
that
make
it
a
more
preferable
option
for
learners
for
instance
distance
learning
can
generally
be
more
flexible
than
traditional
learning
students
have
the
option
to
access
course
material
allowing
them
to
work
around
their
own
personal
schedules
this
means
they
can
listen
to
lectures
submit
assignments
and
take
exams
in
their
own
free
time
they
also
have
access
to
a
virtually
unlimited
range
of
resources
that
would
n t
necessarily
be
available
to
them
in
a
traditional
classroom
setting
additionally
distance
learning
is
widely
accessible
removing
all
physical
barriers
to
education
whether
it
s
due
to
geographical
distance
or
other
circumstances
distance
learning
can
provide
students
with
options
they
would
n t
have
in
traditional
settings
for
example
students
who
have
disabilities
or
chronic
illnesses
can
benefit
from
distance
learning
as
they
can
interact
with
the
same
educational
content
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
overall
it
is
clear
that
distance
learning
can
provide
a
range
of
benefits
over
traditional
in class
learning
by
allowing
students
to
access
courses
anywhere
with
an
internet
connection
and
receive
the
same
educational
content
distance
learning
has
proven
to
be
a
more
preferable
option
for
those
seeking
an
alternative
to
traditional
learning
the
first
experiment
was
conducted
on
the
interior
of
a
frog
we
examined
the
heart
rate
of
the
frog
before
and
after
stimulation
of
its
legs
with
a
paintbrush
we
found
that
the
heart
rate
of
the
frog
increased
once
stimulation
was
applied
this
gives
evidence
to
show
that
the
movements
of
the
legs
are
related
to
stimulation
of
the
heart
the
second
experiment
involved
using
a
flashlight
and
a
liquid
when
the
flashlight
was
shone
onto
the
liquid
the
liquid
glowed
in
a
specific
color
this
was
because
the
liquid
had
a
property
called
fluorescence
which
made
it
glow
in
response
to
the
light
this
showed
that
depending
on
the
type
of
liquid
different
colors
could
be
observed
when
a
light
is
shone
onto
it
these
days
technology
is
an
integral
part
of
modern
society
our
lives
increasingly
rely
on
the
various
forms
of
technology
available
from
computers
and
mobile
phones
to
more
specialized
forms
of
high end
technology
found
in
industry
the
impact
of
technology
has
been
immense
and
its
benefits
have
contributed
significantly
to
human
progress
on
a
basic
level
technology
can
be
seen
as
a
great
benefit
in
improving
our
day to day
lives
the
can
help
us
stay
connected
with
friends
and
family
enabling
us
to
stay
in
touch
easily
and
quickly
in
ways
that
would
have
been
impossible
a
few
decades
ago
in
addition
it
gives
us
access
to
a
wealth
of
knowledge
including
academic
research
news
and
resources
from
around
the
world
on
a
more
basic
level
technology
has
enabled
us
to
greatly
increase
our
productivity
in
tasks
such
as
farming
manufacturing
and
logistics
through
the
use
of
machines
like
tractors
and
computers
we
can
greatly
increase
the
efficiency
of
getting
crops
from
farm
to
table
has
allowed
us
to
quickly
and
efficiently
construct
large
buildings
such
as
skyscrapers
and
automate
complex
industrial
processes
in
addition
technological
advances
in
health
care
have
allowed
us
to
treat
a
wide
range
of
ailments
and
diseases
with
greater
precision
overall
technology
has
enabled
us
to
live
more
comfortable
and
productive
lives
it
has
provided
us
with
access
to
more
information
increased
our
productivity
and
improved
our
quality
of
life
in
countless
ways
technology
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
one
of
the
major
driving
forces
of
human
progress
many
people
face
the
difficult
decision
of
choosing
a
career
at
a
young
age
and
it
can
certainly
be
beneficial
to
start
taking
steps
in
a
desired
direction
at
a
young
age
for
example
i
know
a
teenaged
girl
who
is
already
learning
valuable
skills
in
coding
which
could
give
her
an
edge
in
future
job
markets
however
some
argue
that
deciding
a
career
path
at
an
early
age
can
lead
to
regret
or
lack
of
opportunity
further
down
the
line
those
who
wait
until
later
in
life
to
get
a
degree
or
who
change
fields
as
they
age
often
have
a
well rounded
understanding
of
the
world
and
their
particular
interests
and
can
find
more
fulfilling
work
my
grandmother
for
example
devoted
most
of
her
twenties
to
travel
and
charity
work
and
decided
later
to
pursue
a
career
in
the
art
world
in
conclusion
while
it
is
possible
to
find
success
by
selecting
a
career
at
a
young
age
it
can
also
be
beneficial
to
wait
until
later
in
life
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
world
and
one
s
passions
the
power
of
imagination
in
my
life
has
been
both
tremendous
and
life changing
in
difficult
times
when
i
faced
struggles
and
setbacks
my
imagination
kept
me
going
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
hope
and
a
reassurance
that
things
would
get
better
my
imagination
served
as
a
source
of
positivity
that
helped
me
hold
onto
my
self respect
and
have
faith
in
myself
when
i
was
challenged
to
think
of
innovative
and
creative
solutions
to
my
problems
my
imagination
came
to
my
rescue
even
when
things
seemed
impossible
i
would
use
my
imagination
to
find
answers
and
move
forward
through
this
process
i
ve
learned
to
understand
the
power
of
using
imagination
to
achieve
success
helps
me
come
up
with
viable
new
solutions
to
old
problems
and
offers
different
ways
of
viewing
any
situation
it
gives
me
the
opportunity
to
explore
many
possibilities
and
find
the
best
fit
with
imagination
on
my
side
i
can
boldly
face
whatever
life
throws
at
me
and
have
confidence
that
success
will
be
within
reach
by
leveraging
advancements
in
technology
communication
family
time
and
job
responsibilities
can
each
be
significantly
improved
communication
can
be
enhanced
by
virtual
collaboration
tools
making
it
simpler
for
distributed
teammates
to
work
together
on
tasks
and
projects
family
time
can
be
bolstered
by
video
conferencing
so
loved
ones
that
are
far
away
can
still
spend
time
together
online
gaming
and
streaming
services
can
also
help
bring
distant
family
and
friends
closer
and
job related
tasks
can
be
simplified
through
automation
and
artificial
intelligence
freeing
up
time
in
the
work
day
for
more
meaningful
activities
has
the
potential
to
really
make
a
positive
impact
in
all
these
areas
of
our
lives
i
strongly
believe
that
transitioning
the
traditional
four year
high
school
education
to
a
three year
graduation
system
would
be
beneficial
particularly
for
students
i
can
personally
attest
to
this
as
a
who
graduated
high
school
in
three
instead
of
four
years
as
someone
who
comes
from
a
low income
family
i
was
able
to
save
money
and
time
by
finishing
my
studies
in
a
shorter
period
moreover
having
the
opportunity
to
expedite
my
studies
has
given
me
more
time
to
pursue
my
higher
education
goals
the
accelerated
education
system
could
help
give
youth
a
much needed
socio economic
boost
by
putting
them
on
a
faster
track
to
success
statistics
show
that
less
tend
to
attend
college
and
to
finish
college
than
other
population
groups
and
this
is
in
part
due
to
the
economic
barriers
they
face
with
a
three year
graduation
system
they
would
be
able
to
start
their
college
careers
earlier
and
increase
their
chances
of
achieving
greater
success
in
the
long
run
on
the
other
hand
the
accelerated
system
could
also
be
potentially
detrimental
to
certain
students
they
might
lack
the
skills
and
resources
to
keep
up
with
such
a
demanding
schedule
and
may
struggle
to
adjust
to
the
fast pace
environment
some
might
feel
pressured
to
complete
their
studies
even
if
they
are
not
ready
leading
to
deficiencies
in
their
education
and
potential
lower
grades
ultimately
i
think
the
three year
high
school
graduation
system
has
the
potential
to
be
very
beneficial
it
could
open
doors
for
many
students
who
can
not
afford
to
take
four
years
to
complete
their
studies
when
done
correctly
this
accelerated
educational
system
could
positively
impact
the
community
by
providing
them
with
the
skills
and
resources
needed
to
succeed
extracurricular
activities
can
provide
an
opportunity
for
students
to
explore
their
passions
engage
in
hobbies
and
build
relationships
outside
of
the
classroom
however
when
students
academic
performance
falls
short
it
s
important
for
schools
to
step
in
and
carefully
control
their
involvement
in
these
activities
at
the
end
of
the
day
school
should
always
remain
a
student
s
top
priority
if
a
student
is
not
prioritizing
their
education
this
can
lead
to
long term
consequences
that
can
severely
hurt
their
future
for
this
reason
schools
should
pay
extra
attention
to
students
who
are
struggling
academically
and
where
necessary
step
in
and
limit
their
extracurricular
activities
this
can
help
to
ensure
that
the
student
has
enough
time
to
focus
on
their
school
work
and
use
the
necessary
resources
to
raise
their
grades
while
this
may
seem
drastic
it
is
important
to
remember
that
this
step
can
encourage
students
to
focus
on
their
academics
and
prioritize
schoolwork
over
leisure
activities
not
only
can
this
help
to
keep
the
student
on
track
to
achieving
their
goals
but
can
also
foster
discipline
and
instill
a
healthy
work
ethic
ultimately
controlling
students
participation
in
extracurricular
activities
when
they
are
not
doing
well
in
school
can
provide
an
important
reminder
that
school
should
remain
the
top
priority
even
during
a
time
of
exploration
and
growth
it
may
be
difficult
for
students
to
appreciate
this
lesson
at
the
time
but
it
is
invaluable
in
terms
of
preparing
them
for
the
future
recently
i
ve
come
to
realize
the
importance
of
taking
risks
in
life
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
has
been
in
my
own
career
last
year
i
decided
that
i
wanted
to
take
a
risk
and
apply
for
a
highly
competitive
management
role
at
a
large
corporation
although
i
did
n t
have
all
of
the
qualifications
i
decided
that
it
was
worth
the
risk
to
apply
and
i
eventually
got
the
job
this
experience
taught
me
that
taking
risks
can
pay
off
and
help
to
open
new
doors
another
example
of
taking
a
risk
happened
recently
in
my
personal
life
i
had
been
feeling
very
stifled
in
my
current
job
and
i
was
not
happy
with
the
way
that
my
life
was
going
after
much
thought
and
reflection
i
decided
to
quit
my
job
and
move
across
town
to
search
for
a
new
career
path
this
decision
was
definitely
a
risk
but
i
think
that
it
was
one
that
paid
off
i
m
now
much
happier
with
my
new
job
and
lifestyle
and
i
could
n t
have
achieved
it
without
taking
the
risk
of
leaving
what
i
was
comfortable
with
overall
i
ve
found
that
taking
risks
in
life
can
help
us
grow
as
individuals
through
exploring
new
opportunities
we
can
open
new
doors
and
take
our
lives
in
new
directions
it
s
important
to
be
smart
and
take
calculated
risks
but
it
s
also
important
to
remember
that
sometimes
taking
a
risk
can
be
the
best
way
to
reach
our
goals
proponents
of
mandatory
extra curricular
activities
believe
that
such
activities
benefit
students
by
teaching
them
valuable
skills
needed
for
success
in
the
real
world
such
as
teamwork
time
management
and
communication
they
also
believe
the
activities
give
students
a
sense
of
pride
and
school
spirit
while
giving
them
a
chance
to
explore
new
interests
and
meet
new
people
opponents
however
contend
that
mandatory
extra curricular
activities
are
too
burdensome
to
students
especially
when
paired
with
the
already
heavy
academic
load
that
many
students
face
some
opponents
also
argue
that
it
is
unfair
to
force
extra curricular
activities
upon
students
who
may
not
have
the
same
financial
or
social
resources
to
devote
to
them
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
evaluation
of
these
arguments
must
come
down
to
the
priority
and
best
interests
of
the
students
evaluating
the
arguments
in
this
light
suggests
that
mandatory
extra curricular
activity
may
not
be
the
best
option
for
all
students
however
with
proper
school
and
parental
support
it
could
be
a
valuable
opportunity
for
those
interested
in
and
capable
of
participating
therefore
mandatory
extra curricular
activities
should
only
be
encouraged
in
cases
where
students
are
both
interested
in
and
able
to
properly
participate
deciding
on
a
career
path
at
a
young
age
can
be
an
intimidating
prospect
for
many
students
the
thought
of
committing
to
one
job
for
an
extended
amount
of
time
can
be
scary
to
some
while
others
welcome
the
decision
to
determine
if
committing
to
a
career
early
on
is
beneficial
for
students
we
must
consider
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
doing
so
one
of
the
main
advantages
of
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
is
the
sense
of
security
it
brings
by
knowing
what
job
they
will
be
working
towards
students
have
the
opportunity
to
gain
a
greater
focus
on
studies
and
skills
related
to
their
chosen
field
this
can
help
build
a
strong
foundation
for
a
successful
start
in
their
chosen
career
and
may
ultimately
prevent
them
from
facing
any
major
career
changes
in
the
future
on
the
other
hand
commitment
to
a
specific
career
at
a
young
age
can
also
have
some
downsides
too
focused
on
a
particular
path
can
lead
to
tunnel
vision
resulting
in
students
missing
out
on
other
opportunities
that
may
have
been
beneficial
to
them
in
addition
students
may
also
feel
a
lot
of
pressure
as
they
are
stuck
with
a
single
decision
they
made
in
their
youth
without
the
benefit
of
hindsight
or
the
wisdom
that
comes
with
age
overall
there
can
be
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
committing
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
depending
on
the
individual
it
is
important
for
students
to
carefully
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
any
major
decisions
and
to
ensure
that
the
choice
still
fits
their
changing
interests
and
values
as
they
grow
and
mature
ultimately
the
best
approach
may
be
to
choose
a
field
that
student
are
passionate
about
and
remain
openminded
to
changes
in
the
long term
in
case
circumstances
change
seeking
guidance
from
experts
and
authorities
can
be
a
wise
decision
in
many
important
matters
in
life
from
medical
advice
to
financial
decisions
it
can
be
beneficial
to
seek
out
advice
from
an
expert
in
the
field
as
such
advice
often
comes
from
the
experience
and
research
of
a
specialist
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
no
one
is
infallible
and
that
even
experts
and
authorities
make
mistakes
seeking
out
one
s
own
understanding
of
a
situation
and
having
the
courage
to
make
mistakes
can
help
in
making
an
informed
decision
if
an
expert
or
authority
does
not
have
a
complete
understanding
of
a
person
s
life
then
any
advice
they
offer
may
lack
accuracy
and
be
incorrect
therefore
the
decision
to
seek
advice
from
an
expert
should
be
made
cautiously
regardless
of
the
potential
benefit
at
its
core
s
quote
captures
a
fundamental
truth
that
growth
and
personal
development
take
effort
unless
we
challenge
ourselves
to
step
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
and
do
something
new
and
different
it
can
be
all too easy
to
stay
stuck
in
a
routine
but
by
changing
one
s
perspective
and
exploring
the
world
we
can
begin
to
see
new
possibilities
and
develop
a
greater
understanding
of
who
we
are
and
what
we
want
in
life
continuing
one
s
education
is
arguably
among
the
most
effective
ways
to
grow
intellectually
by
exploring
different
topics
and
acquiring
knowledge
we
expand
our
cognitive
abilities
and
find
better
ways
to
understand
the
world
learning
new
skills
strengthens
our
problem solving
abilities
promotes
creativity
and
boosts
our
self confidence
gaining
knowledge
through
education
also
provides
us
with
the
tools
to
better
navigate
life
s
challenges
having
an
understanding
of
the
world
helps
us
make
better
decisions
build
better
relationships
and
seize
opportunities
to
make
our
lives
more
meaningful
whether
through
formal
schooling
or
independent
studies
it
can
prove
immensely
beneficial
to
explore
and
learn
as
much
as
possible
in
summary
s
insightful
words
offer
a
powerful
message
that
it
is
only
when
we
try
something
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
that
we
are
able
to
truly
grow
and
develop
by
exploring
the
world
and
continuing
to
learn
we
gain
the
knowledge
and
skills
necessary
to
expand
our
horizons
and
broaden
our
understanding
of
life
classes
provide
a
unique
set
of
advantages
compared
to
traditional
classroom
learning
one
major
benefit
of
taking
courses
online
is
the
extra
time
it
gives
students
to
finish
their
work
classes
do
n t
have
fixed
meeting
times
so
students
can
fit
their
studies
in
with
their
other
commitments
this
can
be
especially
helpful
for
working
students
who
may
otherwise
not
have
as
much
time
to
dedicate
to
learning
additionally
since
online
classes
do
n t
require
attending
in
person
students
can
save
time
by
not
having
to
get
up
and
go
to
class
on
certain
days
furthermore
students
of
online
courses
can
also
enjoy
the
comfort
of
sleeping
in
more
often
college level
courses
are
taking
place
online
more
and
more
showing
the
potential
of
this
type
of
learning
classes
for
college
credit
often
provide
the
same
material
that
can
be
offered
in
traditional
classrooms
but
with
a
flexible
schedule
that
fits
more
easily
around
the
lives
of
the
students
who
take
them
in
addition
to
allowing
students
to
better
manage
their
workload
taking
online
courses
for
college
credit
can
also
increase
access
to
more
classes
as
universities
have
been
able
to
continue
their
operations
during
the
pandemic
by
switching
to
an
online
format
in
summary
online
classes
offer
a
variety
of
benefits
beyond
traditional
classroom
learning
through
such
benefits
as
saving
time
having
a
more
flexible
schedule
and
increasing
access
to
classes
they
are
a
great
option
for
students
who
are
looking
to
make
the
most
of
their
learning
experience
with
the
increasing
availability
of
online
courses
for
college
credit
there
is
much
to
be
gained
from
taking
classes
using
this
mode
of
instruction
making
your
own
decisions
and
creating
your
own
rules
has
numerous
benefits
perhaps
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
it
allows
us
to
take
ownership
of
our
lives
and
to
shape
our
own
destinies
when
we
are
in
control
of
our
own
decisions
we
are
in
a
position
to
create
the
life
we
want
and
to
make
sure
it
lives
up
to
our
expectations
having
the
power
to
make
our
own
decisions
and
create
our
own
rules
also
helps
us
to
develop
personal
autonomy
it
allows
us
to
express
our
identities
and
values
rather
than
having
to
conform
to
the
rules
and
decisions
of
others
doing
so
helps
to
foster
self confidence
and
being
able
to
choose
for
ourselves
what
our
lives
look
like
inspires
a
sense
of
dignity
and
respect
moreover
taking
charge
of
our
lives
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
practice
critical
thinking
and
problem
solving
when
we
are
not
just
following
orders
but
rather
determining
our
own
goals
and
building
strategies
to
achieve
those
goals
we
hone
our
creative
and
analytic
skills
this
gives
us
a
greater
capacity
to
handle
more
complex
situations
down
the
line
ultimately
making
our
own
decisions
and
creating
our
own
rules
is
empowering
it
gives
us
control
and
responsibility
over
our
lives
allowing
us
to
live
life
on
our
own
terms
math
has
been
an
integral
part
of
my
life
ever
since
i
can
remember
from
my
days
of
elementary
school
learning
arithmetic
to
college level
calculus
math
has
been
essential
when
it
comes
to
problem
solving
everyday
math
is
used
in
a
variety
of
places
for
example
when
at
the
store
we
use
basic
math
skills
to
add
up
the
cost
of
items
and
ensure
we
are
paying
the
correct
amount
when
it
comes
to
car
and
house
payments
we
use
mortgages
and
amortization
to
figure
out
the
relevant
payments
and
costs
finally
when
investing
for
retirement
we
use
basic
statistics
and
probability
to
try
and
understand
the
odds
of
certain
investments
in
the
future
math
will
be
essential
in
helping
us
prepare
for
success
being
able
to
analyze
problems
using
quantitative
methods
will
give
us
an
advantage
in
the
work
we
do
likewise
understanding
fundamental
concepts
such
as
statistics
and
linear
algebra
will
become
increasingly
valuable
as
data
grows
ever
more
important
while
some
may
see
math
as
a
chore
i
believe
that
it
holds
many
teachings
that
will
prove
valuable
in
our
lives
understanding
the
power
and
capabilities
that
math
provides
us
will
unlock
opportunities
that
remained
inaccessible
otherwise
ultimately
math
should
be
viewed
more
as
a
tool
than
a
burden
making
your
own
decisions
in
life
has
many
advantages
taking
responsibility
for
decisions
gives
you
the
power
to
shape
your
own
life
enabling
you
to
reach
goals
and
accomplish
what
you
set
out
to
do
it
allows
you
to
live
with
autonomy
and
independence
giving
you
a
sense
of
control
over
your
life
investing
in
yourself
to
make
strong
decisions
will
empower
you
to
make
good
choices
which
in
turn
will
lead
to
success
having
total
control
over
decision
making
gives
you
the
flexibility
to
approach
something
in
a
different
way
and
come
up
with
solutions
further
than
what
is
taught
making
your
own
decisions
will
help
you
become
more
responsible
with
your
time
and
money
help
you
to
feel
more
confident
in
yourself
and
encourage
personal
growth
and
learning
ultimately
it
will
push
you
to
excel
in
all
areas
of
life
giving
you
the
power
to
make
your
own
path
having
the
ability
to
make
your
own
decisions
can
also
be
beneficial
for
your
relationships
making
decisions
independently
can
improve
relationships
with
family
friends
and
partners
as
your
decisions
will
be
well
informed
and
thought
out
it
will
carve
a
path
of
self
reliance
and
growth
teaching
you
more
about
yourself
and
making
it
easier
to
accept
the
consequences
of
each
decision
in
conclusion
taking
ownership
of
your
decisions
can
be
rewarding
and
lead
to
success
being
able
to
make
decisions
independently
allows
you
to
control
your
own
path
cultivate
relationships
and
feel
more
confident
making
your
own
decisions
is
a
vital
part
of
life
that
can
bring
growth
and
happiness
since
time
immemorial
people
have
quested
to
express
their
ideas
and
follow
their
instincts
in
order
to
perpetuate
free
expression
and
create
a
more
just
world
being
deprived
of
the
power
to
choose
and
speak
for
oneself
can
stifle
societal
progress
suppress
individual
freedoms
and
lead
people
to
abandon
their
efforts
to
make
a
difference
freedom
of
speech
is
one
of
the
most
basic
human
rights
it
allows
individuals
to
express
their
opinions
explore
new
ideas
and
defend
their
beliefs
without
fear
of
persecution
when
authorities
refuse
to
allow
people
to
freely
express
their
thoughts
opinions
and
ideas
it
leads
to
the
suppression
of
their
right
to
be
heard
this
situation
lines
up
with
the
ideal
of
a
totalitarian
regime
where
the
ruling
class
has
unlimited
power
it
is
incredibly
important
for
people
to
be
allowed
to
follow
their
instincts
and
ideas
as
well
as
to
question
the
ideas
of
the
ruling
class
this
provides
the
opportunity
for
a
more
equal
society
where
everyone
is
given
the
chance
to
contribute
to
the
decision making
process
and
challenge
the
status
quo
without
the
freedom
to
think
and
express
one
s
ideas
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
achieve
true
justice
and
freedom
showing
kindness
is
an
integral
part
of
being
a
good
person
and
one
that
brings
many
benefits
to
both
the
giver
and
the
receiver
when
we
give
of
our
time
resources
or
simply
a
kind
word
we
lift
the
spirits
of
those
around
us
and
bring
joy
to
their
day
can
be
shown
in
many
forms
small
kindnesses
like
holding
the
door
open
for
someone
smiling
at
a
passerby
on
the
sidewalk
and
helping
a
neighbor
with
a
task
can
make
an
immense
difference
is
self serving
too it
can
brighten
our
own
mood
create
feelings
of
satisfaction
and
even
boost
our
mood
we
can
feel
a
sense
of
purpose
and
of
being
part
of
something
larger
than
ourselves
when
we
give
of
ourselves
voluntarily
moreover
kind
acts
often
lead
to
genuine
relationships
further
prospering
the
atmosphere
around
us
being
kind
helps
promote
our
mental
and
emotional
well being
as
it
enables
us
to
be
more
resilient
and
helps
combat
stress
in
a
world
where
negative
news
stories
are
pervasive
making
an
effort
to
show
kindness
can
help
change
the
course
of
our
day
for
ourselves
and
those
around
us
it
is
a
simple
yet
powerful
act
that
can
have
profound
impacts
giving
of
ourselves
in
whatever
capacity
pays
off
in
the
end
simply
taking
a
moment
to
be
kind
to
someone
means
we
can
be
part
of
something
greater
therefore
the
importance
of
showing
kindness
should
not
be
underestimated
my
goal
is
to
learn
to
code
in
to
achieve
this
i
ve
decided
to
break
the
goal
down
into
smaller
steps
for
example
i
plan
to
begin
by
watching
online
tutorials
and
then
move
onto
reading
beginner
books
about
the
language
i
will
also
research
and
learn
the
necessary
concepts
required
such
as
data
types
and
loops
once
i
m
comfortable
with
the
basics
i
ll
start
to
try
out
skills
i
have
learned
and
read
the
related
materials
i
ll
also
take
part
in
forums
and
ask
for
feedback
from
experts
it
s
important
to
keep
practicing
to
master
the
skill
so
this
is
what
i
ll
do
until
i
achieve
my
goal
finally
i
wo
n t
give
up
no
matter
what
i
ve
set
a
goal
and
i
m
determined
to
reach
it
sometimes
in
life
it
is
easy
to
get
carried
away
with
the
idea
of
being
someone
else
we
may
look
to
others
for
inspiration
and
it
can
be
tempting
to
emulate
them
in
an
effort
to
be
accepted
by
others
or
have
a
false
sense
of
accomplishment
however
taking
this
approach
can
be
detrimental
in
the
long
run
and
can
lead
to
unsuccessful
accomplishments
on
the
other
hand
being
true
to
one
s
self
and
staying
in
touch
with
one
s
own
goals
and
values
offers
long
term
benefits
potentially
even
leading
to
true
and
authentic
friendships
when
one
is
honest
throughout
their
journey
relationships
with
others
tend
to
thrive
and
love
is
shared
in
a
meaningful
way
conversely
when
one
is
dishonest
or
attempts
to
be
someone
else
those
relationships
suffer
and
trust
is
often
lost
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
define
and
make
someone
into
something
they
are
not
it
is
essential
to
stay
true
to
oneself
and
develop
self acceptance
which
can
lead
to
a
more
rewarding
and
fulfilling
life
once
said
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be
done
if
we
are
always
doing
this
statement
speaks
to
the
power
of
productivity
and
its
potential
to
bring
about
positive
change
in
one
s
life
to
be
productive
is
to
actively
make
progress
in
whatever
it
is
one
puts
their
energy
and
time
towards
whether
it
is
a
work
project
or
a
personal
goal
every
effort
made
has
the
potential
to
result
in
progress
this
idea
is
just
as
true
today
as
it
was
when
wrote
those
words
applying
it
involves
an
understanding
that
progress
can
be
made
even
when
the
exact
outcome
is
uncertain
it
also
requires
dedication
and
commitment
as
repeated
action
is
often
needed
to
get
results
ultimately
the
power
of
productivity
lies
in
the
realization
that
what
is
done
today
could
lead
to
something
greater
tomorrow
proponents
of
the
idea
to
allow
students
to
obtain
their
high
school
diploma
in
three
years
argue
that
it
could
provide
higher
education
opportunities
to
low income
students
more
quickly
and
could
potentially
reduce
the
cost
of
a
higher
education
additionally
those
in
favor
think
that
students
could
have
more
time
to
expand
their
experiences
through
internships
and
other
means
to
bolster
their
resumes
before
college
opponents
of
the
idea
argue
that
depriving
high
school
students
of
a
fourth
year
of
education
could
limit
their
maturity
and
allow
them
to
transition
to
higher
education
before
they
re
actually
ready
additionally
opponents
are
concerned
with
the
idea
of
cramming
four
years
of
education
into
three
years
leading
to
students
who
may
be
lacking
in depth
understanding
of
topics
personally
i
think
it
s
worth
exploring
this
idea
further
low income
students
may
be
unable
to
obtain
more
advanced
educational
opportunities
due
to
cost
and
this
could
level
the
playing
field
additionally
the
quality
of
the
educational
experience
does
n t
have
to
suffer
if
there
is
an
appropriately
structured
program
furthermore
if
well structured
internships
are
included
in
the
program
students
could
gain
real world
experience
that
further
prepares
them
for
higher
education
smartphones
can
be
a
major
distraction
in
the
classroom
with
the
capability
of
providing
non stop
access
to
the
smartphones
can
be
used
to
access
emails
videos
games
and
even
social
media
platforms
which
can
result
in
students
becoming
easily
diverted
from
learning
in
addition
having
a
smartphone
in
the
classroom
can
be
a
major
source
of
peer
social
comparison
and
rivalry
leading
to
a
disruption
of
the
learning
environment
parents
should
be
aware
of
the
risks
associated
with
the
use
of
smartphones
in
the
classroom
it
is
important
to
have
open
dialogue
with
parents
about
the
role
of
smartphones
in
the
classroom
and
the
potential
dangers
of
being
too
addicted
or
immersed
in
technology
educators
should
emphasize
that
smartphones
can
be
a
positive
tool
when
used
responsibly
such
as
for
researching
specific
topics
and
connecting
with
other
students
but
that
their
use
can
become
a
distraction
if
not
monitored
properly
in
order
to
properly
address
how
to
handle
smartphones
in
the
classroom
schools
should
consider
the
impacts
it
can
have
on
families
having
policies
in
place
which
focus
on
using
smartphones
to
promote
learning
rather
than
distract
from
it
is
important
when
a
student
is
using
a
phone
there
should
be
clear
rules
for
being
respectful
of
classmates
not
engaging
with
inappropriate
content
and
not
overusing
the
phone
during
class
time
it
should
also
be
made
clear
that
teachers
and
school
administration
will
be
monitoring
smartphone
use
in
the
classroom
and
that
the
students
should
understand
the
consequences
of
not
abiding
by
the
rules
by
thoughtfully
discussing
and
communicating
the
importance
of
not
using
smartphones
in
classrooms
with
parents
and
students
we
can
create
an
environment
where
learning
is
the
main
priority
and
the
use
of
technology
in
the
classroom
is
seen
as
an
educational
tool
rather
than
as
a
source
of
distraction
working
in
a
group
can
offer
many
advantages
that
one
can
not
achieve
working
alone
for
starters
it
can
help
to
get
tasks
done
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
with
multiple
minds
at
work
brainstorming
ideas
and
tackling
issues
progress
can
be
made
faster
and
more
efficiently
teamwork
and
collaboration
can
also
lead
to
higher
quality
outcomes
as
everyone
is
invested
in
the
success
of
the
project
and
laughter
can
also
provide
a
great
source
of
motivation
when
working
in
a
group
having
someone
to
joke
and
laugh
with
can
inspire
creativity
and
help
to
develop
a
strong
sense
of
camaraderie
in
the
group
working
with
people
you
usually
wouldn
t
interact
with
in
school
can
also
result
in
finding
new
perspectives
and
generating
a
wider
range
of
ideas
it
s
important
however
to
understand
a
topic
fully
before
forming
an
opinion
as
this
can
help
to
add
valuable
insight
to
the
team
choosing
the
right
college
to
attend
and
successfully
graduating
with
a
desired
degree
can
be
an
intimidating
process
doing
thorough
research
on
different
colleges
and
the
admissions
requirements
needed
to
gain
entrance
is
vital
during
your
college
journey
it
is
imperative
to
stay
up
to
date
with
your
current
school
work
and
maintain
good
grades
represent
yourself
as
a
student
with
a
positive
image
by
staying
away
from
any
unnecessary
trouble
additionally
researching
more
about
the
profession
of
being
a
lawyer
is
valuable
learn
more
about
the
qualifications
and
duties
needed
to
become
a
successful
lawyer
research
further
into
how
lawyers
help
their
clients
they
represent
questions
and
acquire
as
much
knowledge
as
possible
about
the
ongoing
legal
practices
utilizing
these
steps
will
bring
you
one
step
closer
to
becoming
a
successful
lawyer
the
prevalence
of
obesity
is
an
increasingly
pressing
issue
for
many
countries
beyond
its
physical
health
implications
significant
research
has
been
conducted
to
examine
the
effects
of
obesity
on
other
aspects
of
our
lives
such
as
food
choices
in
schools
while
pizza
and
hamburgers
are
staples
in
many
school
cafeterias
these
high calorie
processed
foods
can
lead
to
poor
nutrition
and
long term
health
problems
fortunately
there
are
a
variety
of
healthy
food
options
available
for
schools
to
serve
as
healthier
alternatives
for
example
fruits
vegetables
vegan
proteins
and
whole
grains
can
provide
a
more
nutritious
and
diverse
range
of
food
items
a
person
s
view
of
food
can
also
be
deeply
intertwined
with
their
culture
it
can
be
complex bound
by
tradition
and
formed
by
spiritual
beliefs and
can
help
to
provide
a
sense
of
identity
and
community
in
some
cases
students
may
even
experience
opposition
to
healthy
lunch
options
if
the
food
largely
does
not
reflect
their
cultural
habits
therefore
schools
must
be
mindful
of
their
students
backgrounds
and
ensure
that
school
lunch
options
can
still
cater
to
their
needs
ultimately
childhood
obesity
continues
to
be
a
prevalent
public
health
problem
and
unhealthy
food
choices
in
school
can
put
students
at
higher
risk
to
address
this
schools
can
implement
healthier
lunch
options
to
reduce
the
risk
of
obesity related
diseases
while
the
upfront
costs
of
switching
to
healthier
options
may
be
higher
long term
returns
could
have
benefits
for
both
current
and
future
generations
these
potential
benefits
could
include
lowered
healthcare
costs
reduced
rates
of
chronic
diseases
and
improved
long term
cognitive
and
physical
development
living
a
life
of
joy
and
satisfaction
can
provide
us
with
a
greater
sense
of
purpose
and
fulfillment
often
we
are
focused
on
conforming
to
what
is
expected
of
us
or
what
feels
easiest
in
the
moment
instead
of
what
will
bring
us
lasting
happiness
pursuing
activities
that
make
us
happy
regardless
of
what
those
activities
may
be
can
be
a
liberating
and
beneficial
process
for
instance
being
creative
can
stimulate
our
minds
in
ways
that
may
help
us
face
hardships
in
life
while
also
providing
us
with
a
unique
outlet
for
personal
growth
social
activities
can
help
us
build
relationships
with
others
that
bring
us
joy
physical
activities
can
reduce
stress
and
help
us
stay
in
shape
which
can
contribute
towards
overall
well being
in
addition
interests
such
as
gardening
art
music
and
travel
can
help
us
get
in
touch
with
our
true
selves
and
appreciate
life
s
simple
pleasures
ultimately
pursuing
activities
that
make
us
happy
can
lead
to
a
more
positive
outlook
in
life
as
well
as
a
deeper
understanding
of
our
own
desires
and
capabilities
everyone
s
ability
to
find
joy
and
purpose
in
life
is
individual
and
unique
and
the
key
is
to
make
sure
that
we
are
actively
engaging
in
activities
that
bring
us
both
happiness
and
fulfillment
in
researching
the
effects
of
culture
practice
and
adjustment
on
first
impressions
one
interesting
finding
is
that
a
person
s
first
impression
is
not
completely
impossible
to
change
studies
into
the
way
in
which
humans
form
and
re form
initial
impressions
over
time
have
shown
us
that
with
the
right
kind
of
interaction
specific
cultural
backgrounds
appropriate
practice
and
necessary
adjustments
in
attitude
and
language
someone
can
alter
their
first
impression
for
example
in
one
study
students
who
initially
had
poorer
first
impressions
of
their
peers
were
able
to
alter
their
opinion
of
them
over
time
with
more
interaction
and
given
the
right
social
cues
this
indicates
that
even
if
we
have
a
less
than
stellar
first
impression
of
someone
it
is
in
our
power
to
adjust
and
change
that
impression
visiting
has
been
a
dream
of
mine
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
and
it
s
a
place
i
ve
always
wanted
to
explore
i
can
imagine
standing
beneath
the
castle
surrounded
by
thousands
of
lights
and
seeing
the
amazing
shows
and
fireworks
that
would
bring
out
a
feeling
of
pure
unbridled
joy
the
rides
that
offers
have
always
appealed
to
me
greatly
i
d
love
to
experience
the
thrill
of
spinning
on
a
roller
coaster
feeling
the
wind
in
my
hair
as
i
soar
through
the
air
would
be
a
place
of
fun
and
excitement
and
a
place
where
i
can
be
transported
to
a
world
of
fantasy
and
adventure
i
believe
holds
a
special
kind
of
magic
that
can
make
me
feel
so
happy
and
content
i
can
envision
the
laughter
and
warmth
of
the
atmosphere
and
how
it
would
leave
a
lasting
impact
on
my
life
it
would
be
so
wonderful
to
create
memories
with
family
and
friends
in
this
magical
place
my
dream
of
visiting
is
a
lasting
one
and
i
feel
that
when
i
eventually
experience
it
i
will
be
more
connected
to
the
joy
of
life
than
ever
before
attending
school
in
person
has
its
advantages
when
it
comes
to
student
learning
although
online
classes
have
become
more
accepted
in
today
s
digital
age
there
are
still
significant
benefits
of
physical
attendance
in
the
classroom
three
primary
reasons
why
attending
school
in
person
is
important
are
direct
connection
with
teachers
hands on
learning
experiences
and
social
interaction
with
peers
firstly
the
direct
connection
between
teachers
and
students
fosters
an
environment
in
which
teachers
have
the
opportunity
to
see
their
students
progression
first hand
instructors
can
adjust
their
lessons
accordingly
and
create
a
more
tailored
learning
experience
for
students
in
addition
the
hands on
learning
experiences
that
are
common
in
a
physical
classroom
are
lost
in
an
online
setting
students
benefit
most
when
they
can
interact
with
physical
objects
and
resources
as
a
way
to
engage
with
the
course
material
finally
attending
school
in
person
helps
students
to
gain
social
interaction
with
their
peers
being
in
the
physical
presence
of
other
students
provides
a
better
opportunity
to
ask
questions
and
seek
clarification
on
a
particular
subject
and
bonding
with
other
students
helps
to
foster
trust
and
understanding
of
the
material
being
discussed
in
conclusion
attending
school
in
person
has
its
advantages
when
it
comes
to
student
learning
establishing
a
direct
connection
with
a
teacher
having
hands on
learning
experiences
and
interacting
with
peers
are
all
key
benefits
of
physical
attendance
in
the
classroom
in
order
to
maximize
learning
the
combination
of
online
and
in
person
classes
should
be
considered
it
is
important
to
be
knowledgeable
of
other
people
s
opinions
because
it
allows
us
to
understand
the
perspectives
of
others
and
the
world
around
us
being
knowledgeable
of
other
people
s
opinions
is
beneficial
in
many
ways
including
having
a
more
holistic
approach
to
problem solving
furthermore
by
giving
advice
we
can
help
each
other
by
sharing
our
experiences
knowledge
and
insights
in
an
effort
to
prevent
people
from
getting
hurt
or
wasting
money
for
instance
providing
sound
advice
could
help
a
person
avoid
investing
in
a
scam
or
prevent
someone
from
getting
into
an
abusive
relationship
in
addition
giving
advice
can
help
people
save
money
by
offering
ways
to
reduce
expenses
or
plan
for
the
future
summer
vacations
are
an
important
part
of
the
academic
calendar
for
students
all
over
the
world
they
provide
an
opportunity
to
take
a
break
from
the
routine
of
studying
and
take
part
in
activities
that
are
both
familiar
and
new
during
this
time
students
have
more
opportunities
for
finding
jobs
and
working
providing
a
valuable
learning
experience
vacations
also
serve
to
balance
students
personal
and
school
lives
allowing
them
to
take
part
in
spaces
and
experiences
outside
of
their
typical
academic
environment
in
order
to
maximize
the
benefit
of
summer
vacations
it
is
important
for
students
to
find
an
appropriate
length
of
break
short
of
a
break
may
lead
to
students
having
difficulty
re entering
the
academic
headspace
and
can
leave
them
feeling
overwhelmed
on
the
other
hand
too
long
of
a
break
can
disrupt
the
momentum
that
students
have
built
leading
to
a
slower
transition
back
into
the
academic
setting
finding
a
balance
that
provides
enough
time
away
while
also
allowing
students
to
feel
mentally
refreshed
when
it
s
time
to
go
back
to
work
is
essential
overall
summer
vacations
provide
an
important
time
of
respite
and
opportunity
for
students
of
all
ages
they
are
beneficial
for
providing
a
balance
between
school
and
personal
lives
and
can
provide
students
with
more
job
opportunities
therefore
it
is
important
for
students
to
carefully
consider
the
appropriate
length
of
break
needed
in
order
to
maximize
their
progress
graduating
from
high
school
a
year
early
may
seem
appealing
to
some
students
but
it
is
not
necessarily
the
best
decision
for
their
future
success
it
is
important
for
students
to
be
well rounded
and
prepared
for
college
or
the
workplace
upon
graduation
graduating
a
year
early
could
lead
to
gaps
in
important
learning
such
as
essential
social
situations
and
skills
that
are
needed
for
successful
navigating
of
any
field
additionally
taking
part
in
activities
such
as
extracurriculars
clubs
or
even
elective
courses
are
an
important
part
of
developing
a
student
s
individual
character
and
the
relationships
they
are
able
to
make
graduating
a
year
early
would
limit
the
amount
of
time
a
student
has
to
take
part
in
such
activities
and
lessen
their
experiences
in
being
involved
in
their
student
community
therefore
it
is
best
for
students
to
stay
in
high
school
for
the
required
four
years
to
gain
the
full
benefits
of
the
various
experiences
they
can
have
they
deserve
the
opportunity
to
have
the
fateful
and
formative
four
years
of
their
adolescence
and
to
be
fully
prepared
to
take
on
the
challenges
of
life
beyond
high
school
excerpt
the
proverb
is
the
best
policy
is
often
viewed
as
an
ideal
for
how
we
should
behave
implies
a
commitment
to
telling
the
truth
no
matter
the
consequences
while
being
honest
can
sometimes
lead
to
hurt
feelings
or
a
loss
of
trust
it
can
also
create
positive
benefits
in
multiple
areas
on
the
other
hand
dishonesty
often
carries
negative
repercussions
because
it
involves
stealing
cheating
lying
and
hiding
important
facts
to
summarize
being
honest
is
always
preferable
to
dishonesty
in
every
situation
it
is
best
to
remain
truthful
even
if
it
means
navigating
difficult
conversations
or
enduring
lasting
damage
to
a
relationship
many
people
believe
that
having
a
positive
attitude
is
the
key
to
achieving
success
in
life
proponents
of
this
idea
suggest
that
having
a
positive
state
of
mind
can
lead
to
increased
motivation
and
productivity
resulting
in
greater
success
further
they
argue
that
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
in
tough
situations
can
help
a
person
better
endure
challenges
and
setbacks
however
this
idea
should
not
be
taken
at
face
value
it
is
important
to
consider
other
perspectives
when
evaluating
the
argument
that
having
a
positive
attitude
is
the
key
to
success
critics
of
this
idea
might
contend
that
a
person
s
individual
skills
experiences
and
resources
are
more
important
factors
in
achieving
success
success
can
also
depend
on
a
person
s
access
to
power
resources
and
opportunities
thus
the
notion
that
a
positive
attitude
is
the
only
key
to
success
does
not
hold
up
to
scrutiny
when
it
comes
to
choosing
a
career
path
it
is
important
to
consider
the
implications
for
the
future
taking
a
career
course
at
a
young
age
can
be
beneficial
in
that
it
helps
to
give
students
an
idea
of
what
they
may
be
interested
in
and
a
better
understanding
of
the
different
career
paths
available
and
their
pros
and
cons
however
it
is
also
important
to
take
into
account
the
drawbacks
of
committing
to
a
specific
career
path
at
a
young
age
one
may
feel
pressured
to
pigeonhole
themselves
into
a
certain
career
and
may
miss
out
on
other
opportunities
down
the
line
ultimately
the
decision
is
a
very
personal
one
one
should
consider
all
the
factors
and
weigh
all
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
before
making
a
decision
a
positive
attitude
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
have
far
reaching
effects
on
one
s
life
and
can
even
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
world
around
them
having
a
positive
attitude
in
the
workplace
can
benefit
both
co workers
and
employers
a
positive
attitude
can
improve
productivity
create
a
positive
work
environment
and
even
influence
the
motivation
levels
of
other
employees
its
effects
on
daily
life
are
far reaching
and
can
have
profound
impacts
on
self esteem
communication
relationships
decision making
and
mental
health
is
an
integral
part
of
having
a
positive
attitude
and
those
who
cultivate
feelings
of
respect
for
those
around
them
are
often
seen
as
happier
and
more
successful
when
comparing
and
contrasting
the
effects
of
a
positive
attitude
against
a
negative
attitude
one
must
consider
how
these
two
attitudes
can
affect
a
person
s
ability
to
think
act
and
succeed
speaking
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
a
greater
feeling
of
accomplishment
better
physical
and
mental
health
enhanced
social
relationships
and
improved
decision making
abilities
on
the
other
hand
a
negative
attitude
can
lead
to
feelings
of
depression
low
self esteem
unhealthy
relationships
and
a
lack
of
ambition
when
faced
with
the
choice
to
have
a
positive
or
negative
attitude
it
can
be
argued
that
having
a
positive
attitude
is
the
most
beneficial
route
to
take
attitudes
can
help
shape
a
more
successful
life
and
in
turn
a
more
successful
world
therefore
it
is
completely
worth
the
effort
to
strive
for
and
maintain
a
positive
attitude
the
school
board
s
proposal
to
add
an
additional
hour
and
a
half
to
the
school
day
has
sparked
much
debate
on
the
one
hand
the
added
school
time
could
result
in
students
having
more
time
to
devote
to
learning
and
preparation
for
standardized
tests
however
it
could
also
have
a
negative
impact
on
their
lives
the
additional
time
spent
in
school
could
lead
to
fewer
hours
available
for
extracurricular
activities
as
well
as
lead
to
disruptive
changes
in
students
daily
routines
furthermore
this
extra
time
could
mean
that
students
have
even
less
time
to
complete
homework
assignments
at
home
some
argue
that
the
additional
hour
and
a
half
of
schooling
should
be
added
as
it
could
improve
educational
outcomes
however
others
maintain
that
this
additional
time
could
be
put
to
better
use
outside
of
the
classroom
they
believe
that
students
should
be
able
to
find
their
own
ways
of
finding
balance
between
study
and
extracurricular
activities
ultimately
there
is
no
clear cut
solution
to
the
dilemma
it
is
important
to
weigh
all
factors
and
perspectives
as
well
as
carefully
consider
how
best
to
make
use
of
the
students
time
both
in
the
classroom
and
out
working
in
a
group
has
many
distinct
advantages
over
working
alone
one
of
the
most
beneficial
of
these
is
learning
how
to
be
an
effective
team
member
working
collaboratively
with
others
teaches
us
how
to
communicate
effectively
become
better
listeners
and
understand
different
approaches
to
problem solving
additionally
being
in
a
group
provides
valuable
perspective
as
we
can
gain
insight
from
hearing
different
ideas
and
opinions
from
our
coworkers
moreover
working
in
a
group
is
often
more
enriching
than
working
alone
as
it
can
be
an
opportunity
to
meet
and
engage
with
new
people
from
different
backgrounds
we
can
learn
about
different
cultures
beliefs
and
even
different
methods
of
problem solving
that
would
be
otherwise
unknown
to
us
overall
working
in
a
group
is
vastly
preferable
to
working
alone
as
it
offers
many
invaluable
opportunities
for
development
and
is
often
far
more
enjoyable
it
is
clear
that
the
unique
advantages
of
working
in
a
group
from
learning
how
to
be
a
team
player
to
developing
relationships
with
new
people
can
lead
to
improved
problem solving
abilities
greater
productivity
and
long lasting
relationships
impression
is
the
effect
someone
has
on
another
person
through
their
attitude
and
behavior
it
is
the
lasting
thought
or
feeling
created
by
the
individual
in
a
social
interaction
celebrities
and
prominent
people
can
use
their
impression
to
create
a
powerful
impact
for
example
a
public
figure
may
use
an
engaging
confident
attitude
to
draw
attention
to
their
platform
impression
can
also
be
used
as
a
tool
or
gift
providing
someone
with
the
opportunity
to
lend
their
presence
to
assist
a
cause
or
project
to
protect
their
reputation
an
individual
should
strive
to
maintain
a
consistent
image
and
be
mindful
of
their
behavior
at
all
times
to
ensure
their
impression
is
not
damaged
collaboration
team work
and
being
considerate
of
others
have
been
proven
to
shape
success
in
various
contexts
in
the
workplace
colleagues
who
work
together
effectively
and
demonstrate
consideration
for
each
other
tend
to
be
more
successful
than
those
who
go
at
it
alone
in
family
life
collective
decisions
that
take
others
into
consideration
tend
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
unity
and
understanding
in
school
working
with
peers
on
projects
and
recognizing
individual
strengths
and
weaknesses
can
result
in
enhanced
academic
performance
finally
in
social
relationships
collaboration
and
consideration
can
lead
to
long
lasting
connections
and
positive
interactions
it
is
clear
that
cooperation
teamwork
and
consideration
for
others
contribute
to
success
in
nearly
all
contexts
challenging
oneself
can
result
in
tremendous
benefits
for
personal
growth
and
development
for
instance
a
student
with
a
learning
disability
can
benefit
from
taking
on
more
difficult
material
that
pushes
them
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
when
they
are
forced
to
confront
the
challenge
and
tackle
it
with
determination
they
not
only
learn
the
material
but
also
gain
increased
confidence
similarly
an
individual
learning
to
play
a
musical
instrument
can
improve
their
skills
by
pushing
themselves
to
gradually
increase
the
difficulty
of
their
practice
material
as
the
complexity
of
the
material
increases
the
musician
will
begin
to
sculpt
their
craft
it
is
also
beneficial
for
individuals
to
challenge
themselves
when
it
comes
to
their
educational
goals
a
student
can
make
meaningful
progress
towards
their
goals
by
adding
an
extra
class
to
their
schedule
studying
for
tests
longer
than
they
re
used
to
or
by
participating
in
activities
that
serve
to
expand
their
knowledge
through
the
process
of
challenging
themselves
students
will
not
only
learn
more
but
also
gain
important
skills
like
time management
problem
solving
and
critical
thinking
in
conclusion
by
challenging
oneself
individuals
can
learn
more
than
knowledge
they
can
learn
how
to
use
knowledge
effectively
challenging
oneself
in
different
scenarios
whether
it
s
playing
a
musical
instrument
dealing
with
learning
disabilities
or
tackling
educational
goals
can
make
a
big
difference
and
lead
to
greater
personal
growth
and
development
an
influential
philosopher
and
poet
believed
that
knowledge
and
understanding
come
through
living
boldly
and
fearlessly
to
him
knowledge
was
found
through
experience
rather
than
simply
through
books
he
encouraged
his
readers
to
venture
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
and
take
risks
emphasizing
that
growth
comes
from
doing
things
we
are
terrified
of
by
daring
to
venture
out
of
the
known
he
suggested
we
gain
strength
and
understanding
leading
to
further
pursuits
full
of
richness
and
joy
ultimately
taught
us
that
learning
and
growth
depend
on
our
willingness
to
take
risks
and
challenge
ourselves
working
on
school
work
alone
or
with
a
group
can
be
beneficial
working
alone
can
provide
a
high
level
of
concentration
since
you
are
not
being
distracted
by
others
it
can
also
help
foster
independence
as
it
encourages
the
student
to
take
responsibility
for
their
own
studies
and
investments
in
learning
on
the
other
hand
working
in
a
group
can
also
provide
many
benefits
can
bring
together
multiple
diverse
perspectives
and
ideas
that
can
create
a
richer
understanding
of
a
particular
topic
additionally
working
in
a
group
can
provide
social
support
and
motivation
encouraging
the
student
to
be
an
active
participant
in
the
learning
process
each
option
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
but
ultimately
successful
school
work
can
often
depend
on
the
individual
student
and
their
method
of
studying
best
much
of
the
wisdom
and
experience
accumulated
throughout
life
can
not
be
taught
in
a
classroom
those
who
wish
to
learn
and
grow
from
the
wisdom
of
others
must
take
an
active
interest
in
the
life
stories
and
experiences
of
those
around
them
engaging
in
conversations
with
parents
other
family
members
and
friends
can
be
a
great
way
to
gain
knowledge
and
personal
insight
after
all
conversations
provide
an
opportunity
for
us
to
ask
questions
ponder
ideas
and
reflect
on
our
own
life
experiences
listening
to
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
others
can
often
give
us
a
sense
of
perspective
and
help
us
develop
better
problem solving
skills
we
can
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
life
learn
from
the
mistakes
of
other
people
and
gain
purposeful
guidance
on
how
to
navigate
life
s
future
challenges
furthermore
we
can
receive
subtle
advice
on
life
that
might
not
be
so
obvious
if
we
focus
solely
on
our
own
experiences
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
others
can
be
a
valuable
source
of
knowledge
and
growth
if
we
allow
ourselves
to
explore
and
open
our
minds
to
the
perspectives
of
others
oil
has
been
linked
to
numerous
health
effects
and
can
adversely
affect
students
performance
in
school
studies
have
found
that
diets
high
in
processed
foods
that
typically
contain
trans fats
saturated
fats
and
other
unhealthy
components
due
to
the
processing
of
regular
oils
can
cause
states
of
fatigue
difficulty
concentrating
in
school
and
decreased
academic
performance
this
is
why
some
people
believe
that
school
cafeterias
should
not
change
their
food
on
the
other
hand
replacing
unhealthy
processed
oils
with
healthy
unsaturated
vegetable
oils
such
as
olive
or
sunflower
oil
can
contribute
to
better
nutrition
leading
to
increased
energy
mental
clarity
and
better
academic
performance
consequently
many
people
argue
that
school
cafeterias
should
update
their
offerings
to
include
healthier
alternatives
in
order
to
promote
better
nutrition

in

famously
said
is
not

failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
this
statement
emphasizes
the
important
role
that
failure
can
have
in
the
pursuit
of
success
failure
can
be
viewed
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
and
those
that
understand
this
are
in
a
better
position
to
reach
their
desired
outcomes
making
mistakes
should
not
be
avoided
as
this
prevents
us
from
fully
embracing
the
learning
process
instead
mistakes
should
be
viewed
as
chances
to
learn
and
discover
new
ideas
and
approaches
and
dedication
should
be
shown
when
taking
on
these
failures
as
this
provides
a
chance
to
think
through
the
situation
clearly
the
importance
of
trying
making
mistakes
and
learning
can
not
be
overstated
when
it
comes
to
achieving
success
by
learning
from
our
own
mistakes
on
our
journey
to
success
we
can
save
time
effort
and
resources
additionally
learning
from
the
failures
of
others
can
give
insight
and
understanding
to
common
mistakes
ensuring
that
we
don
t
miss
steps
or
overlook
potential
issues
all
in
all
it
is
clear
that
failure
can
actually
be
a
positive
element
in
our
lives
it
allows
us
to
grow
and
understand
ourselves
better
as
well
as
providing
the
opportunity
to
find
better
solutions
and
approaches
to
the
same
problems
by
not
vilifying
failure
and
instead
learning
from
and
embracing
it
we
open
ourselves
up
to
a
greater
range
of
possibilities
which
is
what
success
is
all
about
i
used
to
think
that
my
neighbor
was
standoffish
and
unfriendly
when
i
moved
into
the
neighborhood
he
did
n t
even
say
hello
he
just
walked
by
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
i
was
convinced
that
he
did
n t
like
me
but
then
after
a
few
months
of
living
side by side
he
stopped
to
talk
to
me
when
i
was
out
watering
the
lawn
one
day
we
ended
up
chatting
for
ages
suddenly
the
unfriendly
neighbor
i
had
imagined
no
longer
existed
it
turns
out
that
he
s
actually
a
friendly
outgoing
person
who
loves
to
crack
jokes
and
have
a
good
time
he
s
become
one
of
my
closest
friends
in
the
neighborhood
and
i
m
so
glad
that
i
got
to
know
him
better
extracurricular
activities
offer
many
students
the
opportunity
to
develop
their
skills
foster
new
friendships
and
explore
various
interests
from
volunteer
work
to
sports
teams
to
clubs
and
organizations
there
are
lots
of
benefits
of
involvement
in
extracurriculars
but
there
are
also
some
potential
challenges
one
of
the
major
benefits
to
participating
in
extracurriculars
is
the
connections
and
friendships
students
can
build
team
bonding
in
sports
to
making
new
friendships
in
clubs
extracurriculars
offer
many
students
the
chance
to
form
friendships
with
individuals
who
share
their
same
interests
these
friendships
can
last
well
past
the
student
s
involvement
in
the
activity
an
example
of
this
is
soccer
team
captain
joined
his
high
school
s
soccer
team
as
a
freshman
and
by
senior
year
had
made
lifelong
friendships
with
several
of
his
teammates
another
pro
of
participating
in
extracurricular
activities
is
career
development
from
learning
important
soft
skills
like
teamwork
and
problem
solving
to
developing
industry specific
skills
and
knowledge
there
are
lots
of
practical
benefits
that
come
with
extracurriculars
for
example
when
became
involved
with
her
local
she
honed
her
communication
skills
learned
about
event
planning
and
began
to
understand
the
inner

to
several

paths

went

animal
shelter
one
potential
challenge
of
extracurriculars
is
the
time
commitment
required
with
practices
meetings
and
competitions
it
can
be
difficult
to
manage
the
time
demands
of
an
activity
alongside
an
already busy
academic
schedule
this
can
be
especially
tough
for
students
like
who
was
juggling
the
demands
of
an
ap level
course
load
with
a
commitment
to
a
robotics
team
with
the
pressure
of
maintaining
a
high
while
participating
in
extracurriculars
ultimately
had
to
make
a
difficult
decision
and
quit
his
robotics
team
in
conclusion
extracurricular
activities
have
lots
of
benefits
that
can
help
students
build
relationships
hone
important
skills
and
get
ahead
in
their
career
however
when
the
time
commitment
of
an
activity
becomes
too
overwhelming
it
is
important
for
students
to
reassess
their
priorities
so
they
can
best
balance
school
and
extracurriculars
many
elderly
people
frequently
enjoy
spending
time
outside
as
it
is
a
way
to
stay
active
appreciate
nature
and
socialize
with
other
like minded
individuals
games
such
as
hopscotch
and
tag
have
been
popular
for
centuries
and
are
still
played
today
but
why
are
they
still
so
popular
studies
have
shown
that
games
like
these
offer
a
variety
of
physical
mental
and
social
benefits
for
example
hopscotch
requires
balance
and
coordination
and
tag
encourages
running
and
cardiovascular
exercise
they
can
also
help
boost
memory
and
concentration
as
well
as
provide
an
opportunity
for
socializing
and
enjoying
the
company
of
others
additionally
hopscotch
can
be
a
game
of
careful
strategy
while
tag
can
satisfy
those
with
more
competitive
personalities
of
the
individual
s
preference
both
games
can
provide
hours
of
fun
with
a

of
health
benefits
excerpt
working
in
groups
and
working
alone
both
offer
unique
benefits
and
challenges
each
has
advantages
and
shortcomings
work
can
have
the
benefits
of
increased
cultural
appreciation
and
stronger
communication
in
a
group
diversity
of
thought
and
differing
perspectives
can
be
appreciated
this
encourages
people
to
be
more
open minded
so
they
can
work
together
and
create
a
higher
quality
product
however
group
work
can
also
be
challenging
in
terms
of
managing
individual
personalities
and
completing
tasks
within
a
specific
timeline
for
example
if
one
person
is
harder
to
work
with
or
slower
to
respond
during
the
task
it
can
be
difficult
to
stay
on
track
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
can
help
an
individual
stay
organized
and
productive
there
is
no
need
to
worry
about
individual
personalities
and
conflict
working
alone
also
eliminates
the
need
to
divide
the
tasks
and
there
is
usually
greater
responsibility
however
when
working
alone
it
can
be
easier
to
get
sidetracked
and
lack
inspiration
or
creativity
working
in
groups
may
provide
more
benefits
such
as
heightened
cultural
appreciation
communication
and
collaboration
but
it
can
also
lead
to
challenges
in
managing
individual
personalities
and
delegating
tasks
although
working
alone
can
be
more
efficient
and
organized
it
is
important
to
consider
how
it
can
hinder
creativity
and
cultural
appreciation
the
debate
of
whether
students
should
commit
to
a
career
path
at
an
early
age
is
one
that
causes
fierce
contention
among
parents
and
educators
alike
on
one
hand
many
argue
that
students
should
be
familiar
with
their
career
trajectory
from
a
young
age
in
order
to
focus
energy
and
resources
on
necessary
skills
and
experiences
on
the
other
hand
proponents
of
delayed
commitment
argue
that
it
can
be
limiting
to
make
a
single
decision
at
a
young
age
without
taking
into
account
how
life
and
experiences
may
influence
career
direction
one
of
the
main
arguments
in
favour
of
an
early
career
commitment
is
that
it
allows
students
to
maximize
their
potential
by
focusing
their
education
on
specific
skills
by
having
a
career
goal
in
place
students
can
more
effectively
develop
the
appropriate
skillset
in
order
to
equip
themselves
with
the
knowledge
needed
to
pursue
that
career
an
early
career
goal
allows
students
to
allocate
their
energies
into
relevant
learning
rather
than
trying
to
tackle
a
broad
range
of
subjects
in
an
effort
to
slowly
discover
their
ideal
career
some
voice
the
argument
that
early
commitment
to
a
career
can
be
limiting
for
young
people
it
can
be
difficult
for
a
young
person
to
make
a
career
decision
with
the
understanding
and
knowledge
of
the
world
that
they
have
at
that
age
they
may
find
that
life
experiences
or
gaining
more
knowledge
of
the
broader
career
paths
have
a
significant
influence
on
their
ultimate
career
decision
additionally
the
quickly
evolving
job
market
can
make
it
difficult
for
students
to
decide
on
a
particular
career
path
that
best
suits
their
interests
and
abilities
that
will
still
be
in
existence
in
the
years
to
come
in
conclusion
the
decision
to
commit
to
a
career
at
a
young
age
should
be
based
on
a
full
understanding
of
the
pros
and
cons
while
focusing
on
a
clear
career
goal
from
an
early
age
can
enable
students
to
maximize
their
potential
the
potential
limitations
of
making
such
a
decision
too
soon
should
be
taken
into
account
ultimately
only
by
considering
the
impact
of
an
early
career
commitment
can
students
be
enabled
to
make
a
decision
regarding
a
career
path
that
best
suits
their
goals
and
ambitions
is
an
intangible
yet
powerful
factor
that
can
influence
how
one
lives
their
life
and
ultimately
how
successful
they
become
has
indicated
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
greater
success
increased
happiness
and
greater
acceptance
within
oneself
or
a
community
this
is
because
those
with
positive
attitudes
not
only
tend
to
recognize
their
own
potential
but
also
are
better
at
embracing
and
seeing
opportunities
to
grow
and
better
themselves
moreover
personal
experiences
and
life
lessons
can
be
a
primary
factor
that
can
influence
one
s
attitude
towards
life
enabling
them
to
face
challenges
stay
positive
even
when
faced
with
adversity
and
constantly
strive
to
be
better
positive
attitudes
can
also
be
infectious
enabling
those
with
an
upbeat
attitude
to
be
role
models
for
those
in
their
community
encouraging
positivity
and
providing
the
motivation
necessary
to
help
others
overcome
challenges
and
find
success
the
importance
of
acknowledging
and
encouraging
people
with
positive
attitudes
is
invaluable
to
any
community
as
it
encourages
an
environment
of
growth
and
any
form
of
adversity
can
be
faced
together
ultimately
having
a
positive
attitude
can
help
individuals
to
unlock
their
full
potential
and
have
great
success
it
is
no
surprise
that
attitude
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
various
forms
of
personal
success
the
political
implications
of
naturalization
of
citizens
from
foreign
countries
are
complex
s
writings
explain
that
naturalization
can
present
economic
voting
and
language
issues
for
citizens
that
immigrate
from
other
countries
naturalization
can
provide
opportunities
for
citizens
from
other
countries
to
find
better
employment
earn
more
money
and
gain
access
to
the
voting
booth
allowing
them
to
affect
change
in
their
new
nation
however
naturalization
can
also
contribute
to
instability
in
the
societies
of
newly
naturalized
citizens
as
they
adjust
to
new
cultures
and
laws
one
issue
that
has
been
linked
to
naturalization
is
the
sale
and
purchase
of
guns
on
the
street
studies
have
shown
that
gun
activity
tends
to
increase
in
communities
with
high
naturalization
rates
especially
among
young
adults
this
suggests
that
gun
laws
might
need
to
be
more
strictly
enforced
or
modified
as
immigrants
become
naturalized
citizens
overall
it
is
clear
that
the
political
implications
of
naturalization
can
be
complex
and
far
reaching
provides
numerous
opportunities
for
citizens
from
other
countries
but
also
brings
with
it
a
number
of
potential
challenges
we
must
study
the
issue
of
gun
control
in
relation
to
naturalization
and
consider
how
laws
and
policies
might
need
to
be
adjusted
in
order
to
ensure
that
naturalization
not
only
benefits
the
newly
naturalized
citizens
but
also
their
new
communities
extending
the
school
day
by
two
hours
could
lead
to
improved
learning
and
development
among
students
on
the
one
hand
having
two
more
hours
will
allow
for
extended
practice
of
concepts
and
the
opportunity
to
pursue
more
advanced
material
additionally
since
classes
are
smaller
within
a
lengthened
day
instructors
can
provide
students
with
more
personalized
instruction
on
the
other
hand
it
may
lead
to
increased
fatigue
and
an
overall
worse
learning
environment
due
to
the
extra
hours
this
could
lead
to
physical
and
mental
exhaustion
as
well
as
decreased
motivation
to
put
effort
into
learning
to
ensure
that
students
make
the
most
out
of
extra
school
time
an
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
strategically
planning
the
day
to
keep
students
engaged
and
focused
while
still
allowing
for
restful
breaks
and
appropriate
amounts
of
time
for
assigned
tasks
i
was
first
introduced
to
skateboarding
when
i
was
nine
years
old
having
never
tried
a
board
before
i
was
curious
and
eager
to
learn
but
did
n t
know
where
to
start
a
friend
of
mine
had
been
skateboarding
for
a
while
so
i
asked
him
to
teach
me
a
few
basics
the
different
components
of
a
skateboard
such
as
decks
grip
tapes
trucks
wheels
and
hardware
and
how
to
properly
stand
and
balance
on
the
board
the
journey
of
learning
to
skateboard
was
full
of
ups
and
downs
but
i
stayed
motivated
by
pushing
myself
to
try
and
learn
tricks
i
realized
very
quickly
that
skateboarding
was
more
than
just
a
hobby
it
was
a
way
for
me
to
express
myself
and
explore
as
i
learned
the
tricks
and
refined
my
skills
i
cultivated
an
inner
strength
that
helped
me
in
life
skateboarding
became
my
outlet
for
creative
expression
and
physical
release
pushing
myself
to
learn
new
things
and
excel
in
my
craft
as
time
went
on
i
grew
more
dedicated
to
skateboarding
and
found
satisfaction
in
my
accomplishments
proficiency
in
skating
has
helped
shape
my
outlook
towards
challenges
that
come
up
in
life
it
has
taught
me
to
stay
committed
to
my
goals
despite
setbacks
and
to
keep
striving
to
meet
them
with
courage
and
perseverance
has
been
an
incredibly
valuable
part
of
my
life
it
has
pushed
me
to
learn
and
explore
more
and
taught
me
the
importance
of
commitment
and
focus
i
am
immensely
grateful
and
proud
of
how
far
i
have
come
in
skateboarding
and
i
am
eager
to
continue
this
journey
in
today
s
digital
world
it
is
no
surprise
that
online
classes
have
become
increasingly
popular
among
high
school
students
as
we
move
deeper
into
the
century
more
and
more
students
and
parents
are
questioning
whether
online
courses
can
provide
an
adequate
educational
experience
for
high
school
students
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
taking
online
classes
on
the
one
hand
the
flexibility
that
online
courses
offer
is
attractive
to
both
students
and
parents
for
students
who
often
have
competing
demands
on
their
time
being
able
to
attend
classes
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
home
can
be
a
huge
benefit
for
parents
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
their
children
are
not
in
a
physical
classroom
environment
can
be
a
relief
additionally
online
classes
often
provide
additional
resources
like
student led
discussion
boards
and
forums
which
can
be
a
great
way
for
students
to
connect
with
peers
and
get
the
kind
of
support
they
might
not
get
in
a
traditional
classroom
environment
on
the
other
hand
the
lack
of
face to face
interaction
and
the
potential
for
distraction
are
two
drawbacks
of
taking
online
courses
for
students
having
no
peers
or
teachers
around
for
support
can
be
a
challenge
for
parents
not
being
able
to
physically
monitor
their
children
s
progress
in
the
classroom
can
be
a
source
of
worry
additionally
distractions
such
as
watching
tv
or
playing
video
games
while
taking
an
online
class
can
lead
to
lower
grades
and
incomplete
assignments
overall
it
is
clear
that
online
classes
can
provide
an
appropriate
educational
experience
for
high
school
students
but
it
is
important
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
before
making
a
decision
students
and
parents
should
weigh
the
benefits
of
taking
an
online
class
against
the
potential
drawbacks
in
order
to
determine
which
option
is
best
for
them
as
the
of
our
school
it
is
your
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
health
and
wellbeing
of
our
students
is
being
taken
seriously
unfortunately
the
current
school
menu
does
not
reflect
this
with
unhealthy
options
such
as
greasy
fast
food
options
being
offered
on
a
regular
basis
studies
have
shown
that
by
offering
healthier
meals
to
children
in
school
it
can
lead
to
an
increase
in
concentration
energy
levels
and
overall
health
we
believe
that
making
healthier
choices
easier
for
students
can
have
a
lasting
impact
on
their
physical
and
mental
health
two
of
the
major
issues
with
the
current
school
menu
are
the
lack
of
fresh
nutritious
options
and
the
high
cost
of
these
meals
we
suggest
replacing
the
unhealthy
items
on
the
menu
with
a
range
of
fresh
healthy
options
that
are
both
more
affordable
and
healthier
for
our
students
this
could
include
a
variety
of
fresh
seasonal
fruits
and
vegetables
as
well
as
lean
protein
sources
we
could
also
look
at
introducing
more
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
to
the
menu
as
these
can
be
both
healthy
and
delicious
making
these
necessary
changes
to
our
school
s
menu
will
benefit
our
students
in
the
long
run
as
it
will
give
them
the
opportunity
to
make
healthier
food
choices
that
will
help
them
to
stay
healthy
active
and
focused
we
hope
that
you
will
consider
our
proposal
and
make
the
switch
to
a
healthier
school
menu
the
wealth
of
benefits
accompanying
an
active
lifestyle
and
spending
time
outdoors
is
well documented
from
strengthened
muscles
to
an
increased
ability
to
cope
with
stress
participating
in
sports
offers
tremendous
benefits
to
our
health
through
physical
activities
such
as
walking
climbing
swimming
or
playing
sports
our
bodies
are
provided
with
an
opportunity
to
move
and
to
breathe
we
become
stronger
and
better
conditioned
our
mental
state
is
also
improved
limiting
our
technology
usage
creates
an
opportunity
for
families
to
become
closer
without
the
distraction
of
games
screens
and
social
media
family
members
can
focus
more
on
one
another
and
create
more
meaningful
connections
the
quality
time
spent
together
outside
in
nature
increases
a
sense
of
well being
and
can
foster
healthier
relationships
in
conclusion
it
is
clear
that
healthy
physical
activities
and
spending
time
away
from
technology
are
necessary
for
the
overall
well being
of
our
bodies
and
our
minds
to
promote
a
stronger
family
life
individuals
and
families
should
incorporate
healthy
physical
activities
into
their
lifestyles
and
limit
their
tech
usage
to
build
deeper
relationships
failing
in
life
can
provide
invaluable
lessons
and
prepare
us
for
entry
into
the
real
world
many
view
failure
as
a
dead end
believing
that
past
mistakes
can
not
be
rectified
or
that
success
could
never
be
achieved
after
a
failure
this
however
could
not
be
further
from
the
truth
rather
than
allowing
a
fear
of
failure
to
stop
you
from
progressing
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
any
errors
made
and
use
those
lessons
to
continue
striving
taking
positive
action
towards
achieving
goals
utilizing
resources
and
seeking
guidance
from
mentors
can
help
increase
the
likelihood
of
success
although
failure
is
a
difficult
experience
it
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
deterrent
to
future
success
instead
recognise
it
as
a
stepping
stone
for
growth
and
improvement
it
is
possible
to
prove
to
doubters
that
success
can
be
achieved
after
failure
by
demonstrating
a
commitment
to
self improvement
and
perseverance
in
the
face
of
adversity
ultimately
even
when
we
fail
we
should
never
give
up
our
dreams
and
aim
to
rise
above
our
past
mistakes
making
decisions
based
on
multiple
opinions
especially
from
older
people
has
many
benefits
by
consulting
multiple
people
you
can
gain
insight
into
different
perspectives
and
better
evaluate
potential
success
or
failure
additionally
older
people
often
possess
the
wisdom
and
experience
that
can
help
guide
the
decision making
process
their
opinions
and
advice
can
provide
invaluable
context
that
makes
decision making
easier
and
more
successful
ultimately
if
you
take
the
time
to
seek
out
multiple
opinions
you
can
make
more
informed
well rounded
decisions
that
are
more
likely
to
yield
positive
results
excerpt
one
of
the
main
arguments
in
favor
of
a
four day
school
week
with
two hour
school
days
is
that
it
can
provide
greater
learning
flexibility
and
reduce
teacher
workloads
by
implementing
this
model
schools
can
integrate
more
project
and
individual
work
that
would
otherwise
not
fit
into
a
traditional
five day
week
allowing
teachers
to
focus
more
on
student
learning
instead
of
lesson
plans
furthermore
with
extra
time
on
mondays
teachers
can
have
greater
opportunities
to
plan
and
prepare
for
the
week
ahead
at
the
same
time
implementing
a
four day
school
week
with
two hour
school
days
may
also
pose
some
drawbacks
for
instance
reducing
the
amount
of
contact
time
with
teachers
may
put
students
at
a
disadvantage
in
understanding
and
mastering
course
material
additionally
with
such
a
condensed
schedule
teachers
may
have
less
time
to
spend
on
individual
student
needs
and
tutoring
finally
two hour
school
days
require
more
concentrated
student
effort
which
can
be
difficult
for
young
students
to
manage
ultimately
the
implementation
of
a
four day
school
week
with
two hour
school
days
should
be
carefully
considered
as
all
benefits
and
risks
should
be
weighed
against
each
other
when
it
comes
to
student
academic
achievement
engagement
levels
and
potential
for
early
graduation
online
classes
and
traditional
classroom based
education
differ
in
key
ways
in
terms
of
student
academic
achievement
studies
have
shown
that
students
enrolled
in
online
classes
generally
score
higher
on
tests
than
their
counterparts
in
traditional
classrooms
in
part
due
to
an
increased
ability
to
focus
on
the
topic
material
similarly
students
in
online
classes
tend
to
have
higher
engagement
levels
than
their
counterparts
in
traditional
classrooms
as
there
are
no
distractions
from
their
peers
finally
online
classes
can
also
potentially
lead
to
early
graduation
as
students
are
able
to
work
more
quickly
and
are
presented
with
a
wider
range
of
course
options
pros
of
online
classes
include
increased
student
focus
higher
engagement
levels
and
potential
for
early
graduation
on
the
other
hand
cons
of
online
classes
include
the
lack
of
forum style
discussions
or
lectures
technology
issues
and
a
greater
emphasis
on
independent
study
pros
of
traditional
classroom based
education
include
the
opportunity
for
more
interactive
learning
a
sense
of
community
among
students
and
exposure
to
potential
mentors
cons
of
traditional
classroom based
education
include
the
potential

set

limited

options
first
impressions
are
powerful
and
often
rooted
in
lasting
impressions
it
s
no
secret
that
a
strong
first
impression
can
prove
to
be
a
decisive
factor
in
a
relationship
or
an
endeavor
but
can
the
power
of
an
initial
encounter
always
be
convincing
while
we
all
strive
to
make
a
good
first
impression
the
reality
is
that
first
impressions
are
almost
impossible
to
change
the
yearlong
study
on
first
impressions
concluded
that
our
instincts
are
surprisingly
accurate
when
it
comes
to
forming
an
impression
of
someone
from
a
brief
conversation
or
an
introduction
it
takes
only
a
few
seconds
for
the
brain
to
form
a
judgement
in
many
cases
this
judgement
is
so
strong
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
shake
off
no
matter
what
the
person
does
to
prove
otherwise
moreover
first
impressions
are
heavily
influenced
by
a
person
s
emotions
if
we
meet
someone
in
an
unfavorable
situation
like
fear
or
stress
our
impression
of
them
will
be
affected
in
a
lot
of
cases
people
are
judged
in
the
context
of
a
problem
and
it
takes
more
effort
to
be
seen
in
a
positive
light
again
in
the
end
it
is
clear
that
first
impressions
are
usually
hard
to
shake
off
despite
our
efforts
to
form
different
opinions
an
initial
perception
can
often
shape
the
way
people
are
perceived
in
the
future
working
in
a
group
has
numerous
advantages
both
socially
and
academically
with
group
work
you
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
new
people
broaden
your
horizons
and
gain
knowledge
from
others
who
may
have
different
expertise
than
you
doing
collaborative
work
also
means
that
more
minds
are
working
together
to
generate
innovative
ideas
and
finding
creative
solutions
moreover
working
in
a
group
can
often
help
to
ensure
better
results
and
a
higher
grade
in
an
assignment
or
course
with
everyone
sharing
the
responsibility
and
relying
on
each
other
s
talents
to
reach
a
common
goal
working
in
a
group
also
encourages
team building
and
helps
to
develop
your
communication
skills
including
the
ability
to
actively
listen
and
express
your
opinion
in
a
respectful
way
the
social
aspect
of
collaborating
in
group
work
can
also
lead
to
the
creation
of
lasting
friendships
by
working
together
in
a
supportive
environment
there
are
many
opportunities
for
meaningful
conversations
and
shared
experiences
to
be
had all
of
which
can
lead
to
lasting
relationships
in
conclusion
the
benefits
of
group
work
are
many from
both
a
professional
and
a
social
standpoint
from
developing
your
creativity
and
communication
skills
to
the
potential
to
make
new
friends group
work
has
the
potential
to
be
highly
rewarding
extending
the
school
day
carries
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
on
the
one
hand
students
will
have
more
time
for
learning
core
material
and
exploring
areas
of
special
interest
however
this
will
only
be
possible
if
students
are
able
to
sustain
concentration
for
a
longer
period
of
time
some
research
suggests
that
students
may
become
bored
and
distracted
leading
to
lower
academic
performance
on
the
other
hand
implementing
a
four
day
school
week
could
also
provide
more
learning
time
without
pushing
students
past
their
mental
limits
officials
must
weigh
these
factors
carefully
when
deciding
which
option
is
best
suited
to
their
school
system
my
aunt
s
failed
attempts
to
travel
may
have
been
discouraging
but
looking
back
i
can
see
that
these
failures
led
to
a
great
success
after
many
failed
attempts
my
aunt
was
finally
able
to
visit
her
family
in
the
same
could
be
said
of
my
experience
with
a
failed
english
test
in
high
school
after
failing
the
test
three
times
i
eventually
passed
and
was
accepted
into
college
s
statement
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
is
true
in
both
of
these
cases
though
failure
can
be
discouraging
it
can
lead
to
even
greater
successes
if
you
stay
enthusiastic
and
do
n t
give
up
truly
does
come
with
perseverance
being
yourself
means
embracing
the
qualities
that
make
you
the
individual
that
you
are
it
is
the
process
of
being
confident
in
who
you
are
and
living
your
life
honestly
and
authentically
history
there
have
been
many
examples
of
people
seeking
to
be
someone
they
are
not
whether
it
be
to
hide
their
true
identities
from
an
oppressive
government
to
fit
in
with
a
different
social
circle
or
to
simply
chase
a
different
version
of
themselves
this
kind
of
transformation
can
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
the
one
hand
a
person
may
be
able
to
reinvent
themselves
for
the
better
freeing
themselves
of
the
trappings
of
the
past
and
emerging
anew
unburdened
by
whatever
shackles
them
but
on
the
other
they
may
be
forced
to
change
themselves
in
undesirable
ways
potentially
becoming
cowardly
in
their
attempt
to
fit
in
with
their
new
environment
furthermore
it
can
be
difficult
to
return
to
the
person
they
once
were
due
to
societal
pressures
fear
of
what
others
may
think
or
simply
a
lack
of
the
same
spirit
that
led
them
to
make
the
change
in
the
first
place
overall
changing
who
you
are
involves
taking
a
risk
and
reflects
how
someone
adapts
to
their
dynamic
environment
it
challenges
the
very
cohesive
idea
of
an
unchanging
original
you
as
one
may
have
different
personalities
in
different
settings
contexts
or
times
in
life
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
success
in
life
responsible
amusing
and
interesting
are
all
positive
qualities
that
go
hand in hand
with
having
a
positive
attitude
when
we
take
responsibly
for
our
actions
and
our
attitudes
we
show
that
we
are
contributing
members
of
society
and
people
respect
us
for
it
being
amusing
and
entertaining
can
lift
others
spirits
as
well
as
our
own
and
helps
us
make
and
keep
connections
with
others
interesting
people
are
often
sought
after
for
new
ideas
and
creative
approaches
to
life
a
positive
attitude
makes
us
approach
life
with
hope
and
a
sense
of
determination
we
re
more
likely
to
stay
energized
and
motivated
when
we
have
a
positive
attitude
because
we
re
beaming
confidence
rather
than
negativity
and
apathy
this
attitude
can
help
us
get
through
the
inevitable
disappointments
life
offers
to
all
of
us
it
also
helps
others
perceive
us
in
a
more
positive
way
since
attitudes
are
contagious
having
a
positive
attitude
can
have
an
enormous
impact
on
the
way
we
experience
our
lives
and
our
success
for
instance
having
a
positive
attitude
toward
a
job
interview
may
result
in
a
job
offer
with
our
dream
employer
on
the
other
hand
an
applicant
who
enters
the
room
with
a
negative
attitude
may
unintentionally
offend
the
interviewer
or
leave
a
negative
impression
positive
attitudes
can
help
us
gain
friends
be
more
productive
and
enjoy
life
more
fully
as
humans
we
are
constantly
influenced
by
the
people
and
environments
around
us
these
influences
have
a
major
impact
on
our
characters
and
how
we
view
ourselves
the
people
we
associate
with
our
families
our
culture
our
environment
our
education
and
our
personal
experiences
all
contribute
to
the
shaping
of
our
character
take
for
example
the
choices
we
make
in
our
friendships
we
usually
pick
people
who
share
similar
values
and
perspectives
and
those
who
can
act
as
mentors
motivate
and
inspire
us
on
the
flip
side
those
we
choose
to
associate
with
also
influence
our
values
morals
and
overall
character
our
parents
are
the
people
who
usually
have
the
strongest
influence
on
our
development
they
are
our
primary
caretakers
and
our
first
models
for
behavior
values
and
beliefs
parents
often
pass
on
their
history
their
memories
and
their
beliefs
helping
to
shape
our
character
attitude
and
disposition
environment
also
has
an
impact
on
our
characters
studies
show
that
family
dynamics
greatly
shape
our
personalities
particularly
when
it
comes
to
adherence
to
social
values
our
upbringing
either
in
an
authoritarian
or
democratic
family
in
an
organized
or
chaotic
home
in
an
accepting
and
nurturing
environment
or
in
an
unsafe
one
all
shape
our
character
and
attitude
toward
the
world
similarly
culture
and
society
play
an
important
role
in
the
shaping
our
character
culture
and
environment
directly
shape
how
our
behavior
values
goals
and
behavior
are
shaped
as
we
interact
with
the
world
the
experiences
we
have
and
the
ideas
we
are
exposed
to
shape
who
we
become
in
conclusion
our
characters
are
formed
by
the
people
and
influences
around
us
from
the
small
and
seemingly
insignificant
details
with
which
we
come
into
contact
with
to
the
significant
conversations
and
interactions
with
our
families
to
the
sociocultural
dynamics
with
which
we
are
surrounded
all
together
these
factors
shape
our
values
behaviors
and
vision
for
life

perseverance
enthusiasm
and
optimism
are
essential
ingredients
to
success
encapsulated
this
idea
in
his
statement
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
of
enthusiasm
everyone
is
destined
to
experience
some
degree
of
failure
in
their
lives
but
it
s
how
one
deals
with
these
let downs
that
makes
all
the
difference
perseverance
and
optimism
provide
a
strong
foundation
to
push
forward
and
continue
the
pursuit
of
success
in
spite
of
the
setbacks
optimism
and
enthusiasm
empower
a
person
to
take
action
and
move
forward
with
the
knowledge
that
success
is
just
around
the
corner
working
in
a
group
provides
a
number
of
advantages
that
can
help
members
to
achieve
success
for
example
collaborating
with
others
can
help
to
generate
new
ideas
and
solutions
that
can
be
beneficial
for
achieving
a
common
goal
this
can
be
very
helpful
for
brainstorming
or
coming
up
with
fresh
perspectives
on
difficult
problems
additionally
having
multiple
people
working
together
often
results
in
a
greater
diversity
of
skills
and
talents
which
can
lead
to
more
efficient
project
completion
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
also
has
its
benefits
for
instance
it
allows
for
more
independent
thought
which
can
be
of
great
value
in
creative
fields
or
when
solving
complex
problems
furthermore
working
alone
can
be
very
productive
as
it
allows
for
more
focus
and
concentration
on
the
task
at
hand
by
avoiding
distractions
that
can
come
with
working
in
larger
groups
it
is
often
easier
to
stay
on
task
and
finish
a
project
quickly
it
is
easy
to
get
caught
up
in
the
expectations
of
others
following
beliefs
and
opinions
that
conflict
with
our
own
can
create
feelings
of
guilt
anger
and
resentment
discrimination
can
breed
feelings
of
inferiority
that
can
be
difficult
to
bear
it
is
important
to
remember
that
one
should
always
remain
true
to
themselves
and
have
faith
in
their
abilities
and
dreams
the
only
way
to
succeed
is
to
forge
your
own
path
remaining
resilient
during
difficult
times
is
a
key
component
to
maintaining
one
s
individual
identity
it
is
helpful
to
think
about
the
positive
aspects
of
any
situation
no
matter
how
dire
it
may
seem
ways
to
be
creative
and
express
yourself
authentically
reach
out
for
support
from
friends
and
family
and
practice
mindfulness
and
positive
self talk
as
long
as
you
stay
true
to
yourself
empowering
change
can
be
made
when
people
are
not
accepted
for
who
they
truly
are
it
has
a
devastating
impact
on
interpersonal
relationships
and
professional
success
even
though
we
may
be
able
to
connect
with
others
superficially
without
the
ability
to
be
our
true
selves
we
can
not
form
meaningful
relationships
or
grow
in
our
career
my
own
experience
shows
that
when
i
have
hidden
my
true
identity
my
relationships
have
been
superficial
and
i
have
been
unable
to
reach
my
full
potential
in
the
workplace
similarly
s
famous
quote
to
be
yourself
in
a
world
that
is
constantly
trying
to
make
you
something
else
is
the
greatest
accomplishment
acknowledges
the
struggle
many
of
us
face
when
we
are
unable
to
be
accepted
for
who
we
truly
are
it
is
clear
that
authentic
acceptance
of
our
true
selves
is
fundamental
to
healthy
relationships
and
professional
success
eight
years
ago
i
had
an
idea
to
start
a
business
i
was
eager
and
passionate
but
without
any
experience
in
running
a
business
i
made
a
lot
of
mistakes
like
many
entrepreneurs
my
business
failed
it
was
a
difficult
experience
but
i
soon
realized
that
every
mistake
provided
me
with
an
invaluable
lesson
i
started
to
understand
why
i
had
failed
and
where
i
had
gone
wrong
most
importantly
i
learned
the
importance
of
approaching
a
business
from
different
angles
and
of
being
flexible
and
willing
to
modify
your
plan
when
something
goes
wrong
i
also
gained
an
understanding
of
how
innovation
creativity
and
dynamism
could
help
me
to
run
my
business
better
next
time
my
story
is
just
one
example
of
how
failure
can
be
a
contributing
factor
to
success
i
have
seen
many
of
my
family
members
and
friends
also
go
through
periods
of
failure
before
achieving
success
for
instance
my
cousin
wanted
to
become
a
professional
basketball
player
but
after
a
few
years
of
training
and
practice
he
failed
to
make
it
to
the
professional
level
however
after
a
few
years
of
hard
work
he
succeeded
in
becoming
a
successful
coach
using
the
same
skills
and
knowledge
he
had
acquired
in
his
failed
attempt
to
become
a
player
in
conclusion
failure
is
not
something
to
be
feared
with
careful
analysis
and
reflection
understanding
why
one
fails
can
be
the
first
step
to
achieving
success
by
avoiding
the
same
mistakes
in
the
future
as
i
navigated
my
way
through
the
medical
and
mechanic
workshops
i
was
dazzled
by
the
various
career
options
available
i
started
to
learn
more
about
a
specific
career
i
wanted
to
pursue
and
found
out
which
courses
i
needed
to
take
in
high
school
for
a
successful
future
it
was
hard
to
pick
just
one
from
the
many
rewarding
and
interesting
careers
but
i
knew
the
best
way
to
make
an
informed
decision
was
to
research
thoroughly
and
form
my
own
conclusions
i
also
kept
in
mind
that
i
needed
to
enjoy
the
courses
i
took
while
striving
to
get
the
best
grades
possible
in
this
way
i
could
equip
myself
for
a
successful
future
while
still
enjoying
the
process
success
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
is
a
statement
attributed
to
which
speaks
of
the
important
role
failure
plays
in
eventual
success
my
personal
experience
serves
to
illustrate
s
point
despite
failing
out
of
college
twice
i
ultimately
returned
with
renewed
focus
and
eventually
earned
my
degree
similarly
i
persevered
in
the
face
of
other
failures
while
my
first
few
businesses
did
not
succeed
i
eventually
established
a
successful
business
venture
s
statement
that
failure
is
not
fatal
is
true
for
three
main
reasons
first
it
is
often
saying
that
failure
is
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
second
it
is
accepting
failure
as
a
part
of
life
and
understanding
that
it
does
not
define
an
individual
and
third
failure
is
the
impetus
for
reflection
and
improvement
as
the
quote
by
says
if
a
man
will
begin
with
certainties
he
shall
end
in
doubts
but
if
he
will
be
content
to
begin
with
doubts
he
shall
end
in
certainties
making
an
informed
decision
about
one
s
future
career
can
be
a
daunting
task
for
any
high
school
student
while
resources
such
as
teachers
and
counselors
are
ideally
available
to
give
students
guidance
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
choosing
a
career
rests
with
the
student
starting
to
research
the
many
options
and
pathways
early
while
still
in
high
school
can
be
invaluable
in
helping
to
hone
in
on
options
that
fit
the
student
s
interests
abilities
and
future
ambitions
arming
oneself
with
a
wealth
of
information
and
the
ability
to
make
an
educated
choice
at
an
early
age
can
provide
a
significant
advantage
particularly
in
an
increasingly
competitive
job
market
teachers
and
counselors
can
help
students
in
this
process
by
facilitating
meaningful
exploration
of
available
information
and
resources
and
by
helping
to
identify
and
clarify
personal
goals
helping
students
get
a
jump
start
on
their
future
can
be
the
most
important
role
that
these
professionals
fulfill
one
of
the
biggest
issues
to
be
considered
when
changing
the
summer
break
to
and
and
eliminating
spring
break
is
the
effect
on
students
and
teachers
for
students
this
means
that
they
would
lose
out
on
a
week
off
that
they
usually
look
forward
to
the
loss
of
spring
break
could
lead
to
higher
levels
of
stress
and
frustration
especially
among
those
who
have
been
looking
forward
to
vacations
or
time
off
from
school
work
teachers
could
be
put
under
increased
pressure
as
they
would
have
to
ensure
that
students
meet
their
year long
educational
goals
without
the
extra
week
in
the
spring
to
try
and
make
up
for
the
lost
spring
break
schools
could
introduce
activities
that
simulate
a
break
in
the
middle
of
the
year
one
idea
could
be
a
week
of
fun
activities
that
take
place
at
the
end
of
the
school
year
with
events
like
organized
trips
workshops
and
games
another
solution
would
be
for
schools
to
offer
extended
summer
breaks
where
students
could
take
a
longer
break
in
between
and
this
could
help
to
make
up
for
the
lost
spring
break
and
enable
students
to
have
time
off
from
their
studies
working
in
a
group
provides
many
benefits
that
working
alone
does
not
to
begin
groups
are
able
to
bring
a
broader
range
of
perspectives
and
experiences
as
each
group
member
will
likely
have
a
different
perspective
on
the
task
at
hand
from
this
members
can
learn
from
each
other
and
enhance
their
understanding
of
the
topic
or
project
this
helps
to
ensure
that
the
best
possible
solution
is
identified
secondly
groups
are
often
much
better
at
problem solving
as
members
can
brainstorm
and
discuss
potential
solutions
together
in
comparison
working
alone
actually
puts
individuals
at
a
disadvantage
since
they
lack
the
expertise
needed
to
identify
the
best
solution
finally
working
in
a
group
is
also
beneficial
when
it
comes
to
motivation
part
of
a
group
can
be
motivating
in
itself
as
members
derive
satisfaction
and
enjoyment
from
the
collaboration
process
as
well
as
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
when
the
task
is
finished
in
conclusion
groups
provide
a
comprehensive
and
well rounded
approach
to
tackling
tasks
that
is
more
beneficial
than
attempting
to
that
same
task
alone
making
your
own
decisions
without
seeking
advice
from
other
individuals
can
lead
to
numerous
negative
outcomes
including
hurt
feelings
and
regret
people
will
often
make
decisions
in
their
own
best
interest
which
may
not
be
reflective
of
the
opinion
of
others
and
this
can
lead
to
disagreements
and
upset
for
example
a
teenager
might
decide
to
skip
class
in
order
to
meet
up
with
friends
and
the
parents
may
take
offense
to
this
choice
and
become
angry
this
situation
could
easily
have
been
avoided
if
the
teenager
had
consulted
his
parents
in
order
to
reach
an
agreement
that
satisfied
all
parties
in
addition
to
hurt
feelings
reaching
out
for
advice
can
also
be
very
helpful
in
making
important
decisions
seeking
input
from
individuals
who
have
experience
in
the
area
can
often
lead
to
more
successful
outcomes
than
if
the
decision
was
made
without
considering
multiple
opinions
for
instance
if
a
young
couple
is
deciding
whether
to
have
children
they
may
feel
more
confident
about
their
decision
if
they
have
consulted
family
and
friends
who
have
gone
through
the
experience
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
age
is
not
a
determinant
when
making
important
decisions
while
wisdom
does
come
with
age
it
is
still
important
to
seek
opinions
from
individuals
of
all
ages
when
making
decisions
as
everyone
can
have
something
unique
to
offer
for
example
if
a
college
student
is
considering
moving
across
the
country
to
take
a
new
job
they
should
seek
out
opinions
from
their
peers
parents
and
grandparents
in
order
to
approach
the
decision
from
all
angles
in
conclusion
it
is
highly
advisable
for
individuals
to
seek
advice
when
making
decisions
in
order
to
ensure
successful
outcomes
and
to
avoid
hurt
feelings
additionally
age
should
not
be
a
determining
factor
in
the
decision
making
process
as
different
age
groups
offer
unique
perspectives
and
insights
i
firmly
believe
that
my
experiences
and
qualifications
make
me
an
ideal
candidate
for
the
job
in
my
current
role
i
have
been
consistently
praised
by
my
team
as
well
as
my
supervisors
for
my
interpersonal
skills
and
initiative
i
have
a
proven
track
record
of
building
strong
relationships
with
my
peers
and
clients
i
m
also
willing
to
work
extra
hours
even
on
short
notice
when
required
and
i
never
take
the
easy
way
out
when
tackling
difficult
tasks
i
have
consistently
gone
above
and
beyond
to
complete
tasks
quickly
and
accurately
i
have
proven
myself
to
be
a
hard
worker
who
understands
the
importance
of
taking
a
hands on
approach
and
getting
the
job
done
correctly
these
qualities
are
essential
for
a
successful
career
in
this
field
and
i
am
confident
that
i
have
what
it
takes
to
excel
in
this
role
for
those
seeking
to
design
their
own
video
games
a
college
education
can
be
invaluable
many
college
courses
are
available
to
study
the
principles
of
game
design
giving
an
aspiring
designer
the
skills
necessary
to
get
started
in
the
industry
having
a
college
degree
also
provides
a
digital
badge
showing
employers
that
the
job
applicant
has
already
been
able
to
overcome
hardships
and
demonstrate
a
commitment
to
academic
excellence
in
addition
a
college
degree
may
improve
job
prospects
as
some
employers
may
favor
holders
over
vocational
or
on the job
experience
applicants
and
finally
it
s
important
to
consider
the
value
of
a
college
education
from
the
perspective
of
setting
a
positive
example
for
family
members
and
children
from
the
role model
perspective
skipping
college
may
be
sending
the
wrong
message
which
can
have
long term
consequences
beyond
one
s
own
economic
prospects
investing
in
a
college
education
is
an
investment
in
your
future
and
that
of
the
generations
that
come
after

of
the
best
methods
for
improving

s
famous
statement
determine
never
to
be
idle
it
is
wonderful
how
much
may
be

are
always
doing

this
point
through
personal
experience
i
have
come
to
understand

career
first
impressions
can
be
incredibly
powerful
but
they
can
also
be
deceiving
when
someone
first
meets
another
person
they
often
form
a
quick
opinion
of
them
based
on
their
physical
appearance
their
demeanor
and
their
mannerisms
unfortunately
these
initial
impressions
can
be
wrong
and
misleading
and
they
can
influence
our
subsequent
behavior
when
interacting
with
this
person
while
it
can
be
difficult
to
change
a
first
impression
it
is
possible
to
learn
more
and
make
better
decisions
about
a
person
based
on
further
interactions
and
conversations
first
impressions
can
be
seductive
in
their
reliability
but
we
must
be
wary
of
placing
too
much
weight
on
them
people
are
complex
and
multi faceted
and
a
single
impression
can
only
tell
us
so
much
our
initial
judgments
can
influence
our
behavior
and
cause
us
to
have
prejudices
against
a
person
we
don
t
really
know
we
must
remember
to
take
our
time
and
get
to
know
someone
before
forming
a
lasting
opinion
of
them
in
conclusion
our
first
impressions
can
be
unreliable
and
potentially
harmful
if
we
rely
on
them
too
much
so
we
must
be
wary
of
their
powerful
influence
taking
the
time
to
really
get
to
know
a
person
can
help
us
create
informed
and
accurate
opinions
that
can
shape
our
future
interactions
with
them
s
quote
success
consists
of
going
from
failure
to
failure
without
loss
is
an
accurate
representation
of
how
true
success
can
be
attained
it
s
a
reminder
that
success
is
not
always
an
achievable
task
but
rather
a
process
and
a
journey
in
this
essay
i
will
explain
three
reasons
why
s
quote
is
true
it
is
important
to
accept
that
failure
is
inevitable
in
any
activity
be
it
personal
or
professional
failure
is
bound
to
happen
in
order
to
reach
a
successful
outcome
it
is
important
to
accept
and
embrace
the
possibility
of
failure
s
quote
encourages
us
to
not
be
scared
of
failure
rather
it
is
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
reflect
on
how
to
do
better
in
the
future
second
going
through
failure
helps
us
build
resilience
and
shift
our
perspective
towards
success
when
we
are
provided
with
the
chance
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
we
gain
wisdom
and
better
problem solving
skills
this
further
allows
us
to
adjust
our
approach
and
allows
us
to
become
more
equipped
in
finding
solutions
that
bring
success
finally
going
through
failure
has
the
potential
to
condition
our
mindset
into
one
of
continuous
growth
facing
roadblocks
and
challenges
are
a
part
of
any
successful
journey
and
those
experiences
can
help
fine tune
our
thinking
of
what
it
truly
takes
to
reach
success
s
quote
encourages
us
to
gain
strength
from
these
experiences
and
remain
persistent
on
our
goal
in
conclusion
s
quote
is
a
powerful
reminder
of
the
importance
of
failure
and
its
role
in
helping
us
become
successful
by
accepting
our
failures
and
learning
from
them
and
by
building
resilience
and
conditioning
our
mindset
we
are
able
to
move
forward
from
one
failure
to
the
next
while
maintaining
our
ambition
and
determination
after
research
and
discussion
we
have
compiled
a
list
of
ways
students
could
take
part
in
helping
the
community
in
our
area
we
propose
that
our
school
undertake
a
project
to
help
those
in
need
such
as
the
homeless
hungry
people
and
animals
we
believe
this
is
a
great
opportunity
to
engage
students
and
provide
mutual
benefits
to
both
the
students
and
the
local
community
the
project
would
consist
of
organizing
regular
community
service
initiatives
this
would
involve
activities
such
as
volunteering
at
soup
kitchens
fund raising
for
charities
or
helping
at
animal
shelters
we
could
then
use
the
funds
raised
to
sponsor
further
events
and
projects
related
to
helping
those
in
need
at
the
same
time
the
school
would
have
to
be
mindful
of
the
consequences
of
organizing
such
events
and
foremost
the
students
safety
should
be
of
utmost
importance
and
so
the
school
would
have
to
account
for
any
potential
risks
when
setting
up
the
project
additionally
the
school
should
ensure
that
the
project
remains
voluntary
with
no
pressure
or
coercion
of
any
kind
this
way
the
students
would
be
able
to
take
part
willingly
and
reap
the
satisfaction
of
contributing
to
the
community
technology
has
revolutionized
the
way
we
live
our
lives
and
how
we
interact
with
the
world
around
us
it
has
had
profound
effects
on
making
it
easier
for
individuals
to
find
new
jobs
meet
new
people
and
communicate
with
others
for
instance
it
is
now
easier
than
ever
for
an
individual
to
search
for
jobs
online
websites
like
indeed
and
provide
an
exhaustive
list
of
opportunities
to
choose
from
and
easily
apply
for
them
as
well
additionally
social
media
platforms
such
as
and
make
it
easier
for
individuals
to
connect
with
potential
employers
and
even
colleagues
they
may
not
have
had
access
to
in
the
past
furthermore
technology
has
enabled
us
to
easily
meet
new
people
and
build
relationships
with
them
from
the
comfort
of
our
own
homes
platforms
like
and
provide
individuals
with
limitless
opportunities
to
explore
the
dating
and
socializing
industry
and
meet
like minded
people
from
all
around
the
world
finally
communication
has
also
become
easier
thanks
to
technology
we
can
now
chat
with
anyone
in
any
location
without
having
to
travel
like
and
provide
us
with
an
endless
supply
of
ways
to
communicate
with
anyone
on
the
planet
to
sum
up
technology
has
had
a
profoundly
positive
effect
on
individuals
lives
helping
them
find
new
jobs
meeting
new
people
and
communicate
with
others
having
a
positive
attitude
is
essential
to
success

programs
that
pair
older
and
younger
students
have
become
essential
to
bridging
the
generational
gap
between
them
these
programs
help
foster
relationships
between
students
of
different
ages
and
provide
opportunities
for
them
to
help
one
another
for
example
older
students
can
build
mentoring
relationships
with
younger
students
which
can
help
younger
students
and
give
the
older
students
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
satisfaction
at
the
same
time
the
younger
students
can
benefit
from
the
life
experiences
of
the
older
students
providing
them
a
different
perspective
on
topics
such
as
current
events
pop
culture
and
their
own
personal
struggles
through
programs
that
pair
older
and
younger
students
the
older
students
also
benefit
from
learning
about
different
approaches
to
problem solving
and
finding
new
methods
of
teaching
the
older
students
can
build
their
communication
skills
learn
how
to
be
patient
with
their
peers
and
develop
leadership
skills
as
role
models
for
the
younger
students
this
gives
the
program
an
academically
valuable
purpose
which
allows
the
students
to
exchange
information
and
ideas
from
different
ages
enhancing
their
education
and
understanding
of
the
world
when
implemented
in
schools
programs
that
pair
older
and
younger
students
can
help
promote
understanding
between
generations
while
also
providing
students
with
valuable
skills
by
proactively
creating
these
connections
between
different
age
groups
students
will
benefit
from
integrated
learning
opportunities
and

strong
relationships
with
their
peers
as
schools
continue
to
diversify
programs
that
pair

students
present
a
unique
opportunity
to
create
a
well rounded
education
for
students
and
prepare
them
for
a
successful
future
the
debate
on
whether
or
not
students
should
be
allowed
to
bring
cell
phones
to
school
has
been
gaining
momentum
in
recent
years
proponents
of
the
idea
argue
that
cell
phones
can
be
used
for
academic
purposes
such
as
looking
up
information
from
the
internet
engaging
in
virtual
classrooms
and
maintaining
contact
with
parents
and
guardians
during
the
school
day
furthermore
they
provide
safety
for
students
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
by
allowing
students
to
contact
the
necessary
individuals
quickly
and
easily
however
there
are
some
potential
drawbacks
to
consider
when
it
comes
to
allowing
cell
phones
to
be
brought
to
school
for
instance
cell
phones
can
be
a
major
distraction
during
class
leading
to
disruptions
and
unfocused
learning
environments
additionally
the
presence
of
cell
phones
can
lead
to
overcrowding
in
hallways
as
students
are
more
likely
to
linger
and
communicate
if
they
have
access
to
their
phones
taking
these
factors
into
account
any
decision
to
allow
cellphones
on
school
grounds
should
be
weighed
carefully
in
order
to
ensure
the
best
possible
learning
environment
for
students
online
classes
and
video
conferencing
provide
an
opportunity
for
students
who
are
unable
to
attend
school
in
person
to
receive
an
education
from
home
these
platforms
offer
several
advantages
including
an
ability
to
work
at
an
individual
s
own
pace
more
flexible
scheduling
and
a
greater
range
of
courses
however
there
are
also
some
drawbacks
and
challenges
to
taking
classes
online
or
via
video
conferencing
for
example
an
online
student
may
have
less
access
to
teachers
for
academic
guidance
as
well
as
the
social
benefits
that
come
with
attending
a
traditional
classroom
additionally
classes
conducted
over
the
internet
can
be
less
interactive
and
may
be
less
engaging
for
students
the
decision
whether
to
take
classes
online
or
via
video
conferencing
can
depend
on
a
student
s
individual
situation
it
s
important
to
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
determine
the
best
option
for
each
individual

work
was

for

hard

taking

history
is
marked
by
examples
of
those
who

due

their
dedication

hard

from

their

work
and

are
often
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
when
it
comes
to
success
while
intelligence
helps
steer
one
down

hard

is
the
vehicle
that
propels
one
forward
the
old
adage

had
some
wise
words
he
once
said
our
greatest
glory
is
not
in
never
failing
but
in
rising
up
every
time
we
fail
we
can
draw
inspiration
from
these
words
and
use
them
as
motivation
when
we
face
obstacles
or
setbacks
on
our
path
to
success
for
me
resilience
has
been
key
to
achieving
my
dreams
despite
family
members
discouraging
me
i
set
my
sights
on
a
career
in
the
arts
but
the
journey
wasn
t
easy
i
had
to
work
hard
face
rejection
and
put
in
extra
hours
outside
of
my
day
job
however
i
kept
going
and
never
gave
up
in
time
i
finally
got
my
foot
in
the
door
and
realized
my
goals
involves
maintaining
a
positive
attitude
even
when
the
going
gets
tough
believed
that
one
unerring
mark
of
the
love
of
truth
is
not
entertaining
any
proposition
with
greater
assurance
than
the
proofs
it
is
built
upon
will
warrant
this
teaches
us
to
be
open minded
and
mindful
of
the
circumstances
and
situations
that
we
face
while
remaining
resilient
and
focused
on
our
goals
through
resilience
we
can
persevere
and
remain
strong
even
when
presented
with
adversity
as
reminds
us
one
of
the
greatest
gifts
you
can
give
to
yourself
is
the
gift
of
resilience
the
ability
to
bounce
back
and
rise
above
whatever
challenges
life
brings
true
resilience
involves
focusing
on
the
end
result
and
never
giving
up
no
matter
how
long
the
journey
may
be
at
the
end
of
the
day
resilience
is
a
valuable
tool
that
can
help
us
to
reach
any
goal
with
optimism
and
courage
it
may
not
be
easy
but
as
said
what
lies
behind
us
and
what
lies
before
us
are
small
matters
compared
to
what
lies
within
us
we
should
remember
this
and
be
resilient
in
the
pursuit
of
our
dreams
the
pursuit
of
success
is
an
important
part
of
life
and
taking
risks
is
often
necessary
to
further
one
s
career
or
personal
aspirations
taking
risks
can
create
new
possibilities
it
can
help
to
build
confidence
and
strengthen
resilience
and
it
can
also
lead
to
rewards
and
personal
satisfaction
however
risks
can
also
lead
to
failure
or
disappointment
and
they
can
have
financial
emotional
and
physical
impacts
when
considering
risks
it
is
important
to
think
carefully
about
potential
outcomes
and
to
have
an
understanding
of
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
associated
with
them
taking
measured
risks
can
produce
great
rewards
but
it
is
also
important
to
understand
the
potential
consequences
of
not
taking
action
for
example
when
actor
initially
pursued
an
acting
career
in
he
risked
not
finding
fulfillment
or
success
however
he
took
a
chance
and
eventually
landed
a
role
in
the
hit
television
series
and
rose
to
fame
by
taking
a
risk
and
putting
himself
out
there
was
able
to
achieve
personal
success
and
help
push
the
boundaries
of
the
industry
for
actors
of
color
taking
risks
when
pursing
success
is
a
critical
part
of
personal
and
professional
growth
although
there
are
associated
risks
involved
taking
risks
can
lead
to
greater
success
in
life
and
ultimately
to
a
brighter
future
for
all
the
development
of
technology
has
made
a
profound
impact
on
the
way
humans
communicate
and
interact
with
one
another
through
the
advances
of
technology
it
has
become
easier
to
stay
in
contact
with
others
no
matter
the
distance
the
role
of
education
is
essential
in
discovering
the
potential
benefits
of
modern
technology
those
without
the
knowledge
of
technology
may
be
at
a
significant
disadvantage
in
their
day to day
lives
however
technology
can
be
used
for
much
more
than
just
communication
it
can
make
lives
easier
and
allow
us
to
reach
new
connections
even
allowing
those
who
would
otherwise
not
be
able
to
to
interact
and
share
ideas
ultimately
technologies
can
be
used
for
great
benefit
if
used
for
the
right
purposes
having
a
positive
attitude
is
often
touted
as
the
key
to
success
it
may
seem
like
a
simple
idea
having
a
positive
outlook
on
life
can
help
you
achieve
your
goals
and
be
successful
but
the
truth
is
that
having
a
positive
attitude
has
a
much
deeper
significance
and
can
lead
to
real
success
in
many
aspects
of
life
studies
have
shown
that
those
with
a
positive
attitude
tend
to
be
more
likely
to
take
action
towards
achieving
their
goals
and
this
action
is
what
leads
to
real
success
for
instance
a
positive
attitude
can
encourage
an
individual
to
put
in
more
effort
into
succeeding
in
their
career
or
education
because
they
believe
that
their
goals
are
achievable
this
can
result
in
better
career
opportunities
or
higher
grades
a
positive
attitude
can
also
provide
individuals
with
more
self confidence
and
belief
in
their
abilities
which
can
spur
them
on
to
greater
achievements
furthermore
having
a
positive
attitude
can
be
beneficial
to
other
areas
of
life
too
such
as
relationships
by
having
an
upbeat
view
on
life
individuals
can
blaze
paths
to
new
friendships
find
romance
or
even
strengthen
existing
connections
in
this
way
success
is
not
just
found
in
career
terms
but
also
in
personal
connections
in
conclusion
having
a
positive
attitude
can
lead
to
real
success
in
more
than
just
career
terms
positive
thinking
encourages
individuals
to
take
action
towards
their
goals
and
it
strengthens
their
belief
in
their
abilities
and
relationships
it
is
clear
that
having
a
positive
attitude
can
open
doors
to
greater
achievements
and
a
more
fulfilled
life
failure
is
an
important
part
of
the
pursuit
of
success
indeed
some
of
the
most
successful
people
in
the
world
have
used
failure
as
a
means
of
learning
growing
and
eventually
achieving
success
for
example
is
famously
quoted
as
saying
i
m
convinced
that
about
half
of
what
separates
successful
entrepreneurs
from
the
non successful
ones
is
pure
perseverance
he
made
many
wrong
decisions
during
his
career
but
each
time
he
used
his
failure
to
gain
insight
and
learn
from
his
mistakes
it
is
important
to
stay
enthusiastic
when
facing
failure
in
pursuit
of
success
we
can
use
failure
as
an
incentive
to
keep
pushing
for
success
rather
than
giving
up
we
can
also
view
failure
as
a
challenge
take
it
as
an
opportunity
to
apply
what
we
have
learnt
from
it
and
take
the
necessary
steps
to
break
through
the
wall
of
adversity
finally
we
can
focus
on
the
resilience
we
attain
through
our
failures
taking
risks
and
being
bold
enough
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
is
how
we
grow
and
become
smarter
the
life
of
is
an
example
of
how
setting
your
aim
too
high
and
falling
short
can
be
a
greater
danger
than
setting
it
too
low
and
achieving
your
mark
while
was
never
without
ambition
he
shifted
his
expectations
and
expectations
of
others
depending
on
the
task
at
hand
he
once
said
the
greater
danger
for
most
of
us
lies
in
setting
our
aim
too
low
and
achieving
our
mark
this
quote
reflects
his
ability
to
recognize
his
limitations
and
adjust
his
goals
accordingly
he
knew
that
if
he
set
too
stringent
requirements
that
he
could
not
achieve
he
would
be
worse
off
than
if
he
had
set
lower
expectations
and
achieved
them
while
he
had
to
check
his
own
hubris
was
rewarded
with
numerous
successes
throughout
his
life
likely
due
in
part
to
his
ability
to
set
realistic
expectations
and
strive
to
meet
them
his
own
experience
and
success
affirm
the
danger
of
setting
goals
too
high
and
not
being
able
to
achieve
them
working
in
a
group
has
several
benefits
there
is
often
support
and
collaboration
among
peers
which
enables
everyone
to
contribute
their
strengths
and
knowledge
additionally
working
in
a
group
can
provide
motivation
and
a
sense
of
camaraderie
on
the
other
hand
working
alone
has
its
own
advantages
when
working
alone
you
have
complete
control
of
the
project
from
start
to
finish
it
can
also
help
to
reduce
distractions
and
focus
completely
on
the
task
at
hand
working
alone
also
allows
for
a
greater
level
of
flexibility
and
personal
growth
that
can
occur
from
taking
on
the
challenge
of
completing
a
project
without
assistance
both
working
in
groups
and
working
alone
can
be
advantageous
when
used
in
the
right
circumstances
each
situation
should
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
and
the
best
option
chosen
for
the
task
making
our
own
decisions
and
following
our
own
instincts
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
leading
a
successful
and
fulfilling
life
by
having
agency
over
our
choices
we
can
better
face
the
consequences
good
or
bad
of
our
decisions
knowing
we
are
the
masters
of
our
own
fate
allows
us
to
be
more
mindful
of
the
steps
we
take
and
to
be
intentional
with
the
outcomes
we
pursue
taking
charge
of
our
lives
can
also
mean
ignoring
other
people
s
opinions
and
expectations
choosing
to
march
to
the
beat
of
our
own
drum
can
be
liberating
and
give
us
the
opportunity
to
explore
who
we
truly
are
making
our
own
decisions
and
following
our
instincts
can
open
us
up
to
a
world
of
possibilities
enabling
us
to
make
the
most
of
our
lives
regular
inactive
times
are
integral
to
our
overall
health
and
wellbeing
without
regular
periods
of
rest
individuals
risk
suffering
from
fatigue
burnout
stress
and
even
physical
ailments
a
real life
example
of
this
is
an
actor
politician
and
bodybuilder
who
famously
pushed
himself
to
the
limit
while
preparing
for
events
and
competitions
despite
his
high
energy
he
experienced
exhaustion
and
eventually
collapsed
while
filming
one
of
his
movies
the
benefits
of
regular
inactive
times
however
are
clear
studies
suggest
that
individuals
who
take
the
time
to
rest
have
better
physical
mental
and
emotional
health
i
personally
experienced
the
importance
of
regular
inactive
times
when
i
was
preparing
for
my
exams
in
order
to
stay
productive
i
had
to
balance
my
study
time
with
periods
of
rest
and
relaxation
when
i
skipped
my
breaks
i
felt
frazzled
and
overwhelmed
but
when
i
carved
out
time
for
downtime
i
felt
recharged
and
focused
regular
inactive
times
can
help
us
achieve
our
goals
and
stay
energized
by
helping
us
maintain
a
healthy
balance
between
our
daily
demands
and
our
need
for
rest
to
summarize
regular
inactive
times
are
essential
for
our
overall
health
and
wellbeing
taking
the
time
to
rest
helps
us
stay
energized
focused
and
productive
and
can
improve
our
physical
mental
and
emotional
wellbeing
regular
inactive
times
can
also
help
us
achieve
our
goals
so
it
s
important
to
find
ways
to
incorporate
rest
into
our
daily
lives
as
a
way
to
nurture
a
positive
and
supportive
learning
environment
it
is
important
to
encourage
collaboration
between
students
of
different
ages
rather
than
a
student
s
age
or
ability
level
dictating
their
success
a
focus
on
collaborative
learning
gives
an
opportunity
to
all
students
to
become
engaged
with
and
supportive
of
one
another
having
older
students
pair
up
with
younger
students
in
a
school
setting
is
one
such
practice
that
can
be
beneficial
in
a
multitude
of
ways
one
benefit
of
this
practice
is
that
it
fosters
a
sense
of
community
and
helps
children
learn
how
to
work
together
effectively
for
example
younger
students
may
look
up
to
older
students
and
benefit
from
their
guidance
an
older
student
can
help
to
instill
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
provide
assistance
as
needed
by
working
together
and
depending
on
one
another
all
students
involved
in
the
program
will
learn
how
to
create
beneficial
relationships
with
others
additionally
this
practice
facilitates
the
development
of
life
skills
through
working
with
their
older
peers
younger
students
can
learn
how
to
be
organized
and
responsible
having
to
work
together
to
solve
problems
can
also
encourage
creativity
improved
storytelling
and
the
development
of
better
problem solving
skills
moreover
this
practice
can
contribute
to
higher
academic
achievement
working
collaboratively
with
other
students
is
proven
to
increase
student
engagement
and
help
them
to
better
retain
knowledge
with
more
in depth
learning
students
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
both
the
subject
and
the
processes
of
learning
furthermore
the
different
viewpoints
presented
by
each
student
can
lead
to
further
exploration
of
different
ideas
and
allow
for
a
broader
range
of
knowledge
finally
having
older
students
pair
up
with
younger
students
can
help
to
boost
self confidence
and
motivation
for
all
involved
younger
students
may
find
themselves
inspired
to
learn
more
due
to
the
example
of
their
older
peers
meanwhile
older
students
may
be
fulfilled
by
the
knowledge
that
they
are
helping
younger
generations
and
feel
more
motivated
to
complete
their
own
work
for
these
reasons
having
older
students
pair
up
with
younger
students
in
a
school
setting
can
be
highly
beneficial
not
only
is
it
a
means
to
foster
a
positive
and
supportive
learning
environment
but
it
is
also
an
effective
way
to
facilitate
the
development
of
life
skills
improve
academic
achievement
and
boost
the
self confidence
of
all
students
involved
waiting
to
do
an
errand
or
chore
may
sound
like
an
attractive
option
because
it
gives
you
an
immediate
break
from
whatever
it
is
you
are
doing
while
this
may
provide
a
moment
of
respite
it
rarely
provides
any
long term
gain
in
knowledge
or
skills
on
the
other
hand
actively
utilizing
that
time
to
increase
knowledge
and
skill
sets
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
one
s
future
through
research
practice
or
self learning
you
are
not
only
gaining
knowledge
and
skills
but
also
developing
the
self discipline
and
motivation
to
take
on
challenging
tasks
the
knowledge
and
skills
gained
this
way
can
be
put
into
practice
in
everyday
life
giving
you
a
more
solid
foundation
of
expertise
and
readiness
to
take
on
future
projects
thus
the
advantages
of
actively
honing
your
craft
far
outweigh
the
disadvantages
of
taking
a
break
from
it
adding
two
more
hours
to
a
school
s
schedule
every
day
could
have
both
positive
and
negative
effects
on
students
the
positive
effects
include
an
opportunity
to
gain
extra
knowledge
in
the
form
of
additional
classes
that
could
aid
in
students
developing
more
thoroughly
in
their
areas
of
interest
additionally
a
longer
school
day
could
give
students
the
time
to
master
concepts
more
thoroughly
leading
to
increased
academic
achievement
on
the
downside
a
longer
school
day
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
student
fatigue
as
well
as
introduce
problems
related
to
student
transportation
and
fatigue
the
latter
of
which
would
likely
result
in
students
being
more
likely
to
become
disengaged
and
uninterested
in
their
studies
additionally
a
longer
school
day
could
lead
to
a
decrease
in
family
time
as
students
would
have
less
hours
in
the
day
to
do
extracurricular
activities
and
spend
time
with
their
family
finally
longer
school
days
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
stress
students
feel
once
said
do
you
want
to
know
who
you
are
t
ask
will
delineate
and
define
you
this
quote
emphasizes
the
importance
of
being
active
and
how
through
action
we
define
ourselves
being
actively
engaged
in
education
has
many
benefits
not
only
does
it
improve
our
knowledge
but
it
also
teaches
us
valuable
skills
that
can
be
used
throughout
our
lives
furthermore
when
we
help
others
we
are
not
only
doing
a
kind
act
but
enriching
our
own
lives
and
the
lives
of
those
around
us
on
the
other
hand
remaining
idle
and
being
unwilling
to
take
charge
of
our
lives
can
lead
us
away
from
our
goals
therefore
it
is
important
that
we
take
a
stand
for
ourselves
and
for
others
in
the
world
so
that
we
can
bring
positive
changes
for
generations
to
come
failure
is
an
essential
part
of
the
learning
process
as
it
helps
us
grow
more
resilient
and
empowered
it
is
important
to
remain
positive
and
motivated
when
life
throws
us
challenges
and
to
use
experiences
of
failure
as
learning
opportunities
to
make
us
better
and
closer
to
achieving
our
goals
for
example
when
i
was
in
school
i
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
myself
to
get
the
best
grades
possible
and
be
the
valedictorian
of
my
class
unfortunately
i
failed
to
get
the
desired
score
in
one
test
and
felt
like
i
let
myself
down
this
painful
experience
pushed
me
to
work
harder
and
turn
my
disappointment
into
motivation
i
was
determined
to
prove
that
i
could
do
better
and
eventually
i
surpassed
all
expectations
and
graduated
at
the
top
of
my
class
this
experience
taught
me
to
stay
positive
and
use
failures
as
a
motivation
to
persevere
whatever
challenges
we
face
in
life
there
s
always
valuable
lessons
to
be
learnt
from
our
mistakes
or
failures
instead
of
feeling
discouraged
and
giving
up
embracing
these
challenges
and
failure driven
learning
experiences
can
help
one
to
reach
their
goals
and
elevate
their
personal
growth
many
students
feel
pressured
to
decide
on
a
career
by
the
time
they
enter
high
school
but
this
is
not
always
a
good
idea
at
this
age
they
typically
lack
the
experience
required
to
make
a
well informed
decision
due
to
their
age
and
the
potential
for
carelessness
it
is
essential
for
students
to
take
the
time
to
explore
what
interests
them
consider
their
skills
and
talents
and
to
try
different
activities
to
determine
the
career
that
best
fits
them
to
make
the
best
decision
students
should
create
a
plan
consisting
of
steps
to
help
them
evaluate
their
options
these
steps
could
include
talking
with
family
guidance
counselors
and
mentors
considering
courses
and
activities
that
are
related
to
the
field
of
interest
researching
potential
job
opportunities
and
exploring
education
and
specialized
training
opportunities
through
this
process
students
can
gain
valuable
insight
into
their
career
options
make
an
informed
decision
and
ultimately
achieve
greater
career
success
extending
the
school
day
could
have
drastic
effects
on
both
the
students
and
the
teachers
for
students
it
could
mean
added
physical
and
mental
fatigue
due
to
the
increased
time
in
the
classroom
it
could
be
difficult
for
students
to
maintain
a
healthy
balance
between
school
and
their
personal
lives
for
teachers
the
extra
hours
of
work
could
lead
to
increases
in
stress
and
workload
it
is
important
to
consider
the
implications
that
an
extended
school
day
could
have
on
both
the
students
and
the
teachers
before
making
a
decision
to
address
any
potential
issues
it
may
be
necessary
to
provide
additional
support
such
as
extra
funding
for
teacher
aid
or
extended
breaks
for
students
with
the
right
support
the
extended
school
day
could
be
beneficial
to
all
involved
in
our
increasingly
digital
world
a
career
in
technology
has
become
increasingly
attractive
with
job
prospects
continuing
to
grow
it
is
important
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
entering
the
field
as
well
as
the
unique
pathways
available
to
those
looking
to
enter
the
technology
industry
as
many
young
americans
make
decisions
about
their
futures
it
is
critical
to
analyze
personal
interests
and
identify
potential
career
paths
in
technology
that
best
match
those
interests
it
is
also
important
to
acknowledge
the
potential
obstacles
of
deciding
a
career
at
a
young
age
nevertheless
it
is
beneficial
to
take
a
proactive
and
intentional
approach
to
planning
a
career
early
as
it
can
have
far reaching
implications
for
the
future
of
the
states
there
are
several
high
school
programs
available
to
assist
students
with
making
informed
decisions
about
their
future
and
seeking
out
the
career
that
globally
best
suits
them
furthermore
focusing
more
on
this
issue
may
lead
to
even
greater
innovations
that
can
shape
our
future
in
short
evaluating
the
possibilities
and
pathways
that
an
individual
can
take
in
pursuing
a
career
in
technology
is
a
beneficial
endeavor
as
technology
continues
to
pervade
everyday
life
more
and
more
students
are
bringing
cell
phones
and
other
devices
into
the
classroom
while
it
is
true
that
allowing
students
to
use
technology
for
educational
purposes
can
be
beneficial
the
question
of
how
it
affects
learning
outcomes
academic
performance
and
curriculum
remains
unresolved
has
identified
several
advantages
of
introducing
technology
into
the
classroom
such
as
providing
access
to
additional
resources
and
allowing
students
to
engage
with
material
more
actively
whereas
students
may
retain
information
more
easily
through
interaction
with
digital
media
it
is
unclear
how
closely
this
translates
to
traditional
books
educational
reform
necessitates
exploration
of
the
role
of
technology
in
the
academic
environment
as
its
impact
on
older
learners
those
with
learning
difficulties
and
other
marginalized
groups
is
yet
to
be
determined
ultimately
the
use
of
technology
in
the
classroom
is
a
complex
issue
and
its
effectiveness
depends
on
a
variety
of
factors
while
its
potential
benefits
are
undeniable
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
it
will
affect
student
learning
and
engagement
over
time
a
common
misconception
is
that
one
can
achieve
more
on
their
own
than
they
can
in
a
group
setting
however
the
ability
to
work
productively
with
a
group
of
individuals
can
result
in
more
meaningful
outcomes
than
attempting
to
go
solo
by
pooling
together
different
experiences
knowledge
and
skills
a
team
has
the
potential
to
capitalize
on
strengths
that
a
single
person
may
not
possess
working
collectively
enables
us
to
learn
from
each
other
identify
new
ideas
and
gain
different
perspectives
it
creates
the
potential
to
engage
and
collaborate
with
people
from
diverse
backgrounds
who
can
bring
valuable
experience
and
reasoned
insights
having
a
variety
of
perspectives
can
provide
a
well rounded
outlook
and
can
help
to
motivate
and
inform
one
another
work
can
increase
the
efficiency
of
a
project
working
together
allows
for
the
division
of
labor
which
can
help
reduce
the
workload
and
produce
better
quality
results
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
additionally
dividing
tasks
amongst
members
can
help
to
reduce
the
stress
associated
with
the
project
although
working
together
can
come
with
its
own
set
of
challenges
such
as
managing
interpersonal
conflicts
and
ensuring
that
everyone
s
voices
are
heard
the
benefits
of
collaboration
far
outweigh
the
challenges
by
working
together
we
can
reach
new
heights
and
accomplish
far
more
than
any
one
of
us
could
have
achieved
on
our
own
allowing
schools
to
mix
older
and
younger
students
can
provide
unique
opportunities
that
wouldn
t
exist
in
single
age
group
settings
an
integrated
learning
environment
allows
students
to
benefit
from
the
insight
knowledge
and
experience
of
those
at
a
different
grade
level
or
stage
of
their
educational
journey
on
the
other
hand
mixing
older
and
younger
students
can
create
tension
and
discomfort
if
not
managed
properly
in
order
to
ensure
a
successful
program
with
mixed
age
levels
there
must
be
a
solid
framework
put
in
place
to
ensure
all
students
are
being
heard
and
respected
educators
should
focus
on
designing
intergenerational
activities
that
balance
the
social
emotional
and
academic
needs
of
each
participant
clear
and
consistent
guidelines
for
behavior
should
be
established
and
emphasized
throughout
the
program
to
make
sure
that
all
students
are
feeling
supported
there
should
be
a
variety
of
activities
and
programs
created
to
meet
individual
needs
and
provide
different
opportunities
for
every
age
group
by
creating
and
implementing
an
effective
system
for

schools
can
provide
students
with
an
invaluable
intergenerational
learning
experience
as
long
as
clear

s
quote
encapsulates
a
powerful
truth
taking
action
is
essential
to
achieving
our
goals
inactive
or
idling
will
only
lead
to
inaction
and
a
lack
of
progress
it
is
only
by
consistently
taking
small
steps
that
we
are
able
to
make
progress
towards
our
goals
for
example
if
you
want
to
learn
to
play
the
violin
you
must
commit
to
regular
practice
sessions
to
make
real
progress
small
daily
actions
like
practising
for
just
minutes
each
day
add
up
to
big
accomplishments
over
time
on
the
other
hand
that
same
principle
of
consistent
action
applies
to
other
areas
of
our
lives
such
as
our
health
and
fitness
goals
making
regular
trips
to
the
gym
or
sticking
to
a
healthy
diet
are
small
steps
which
over
time
can
have
a
hugely
positive
impact
to
sum
up
s
quote
clearly
emphasizes
the
importance
of
consistent
action
in
achieving
our
goals
inactive
and
idling
will
only
lead
to
stagnation
while
taking
small
steps
consistently
will
ultimately
move
us
towards
our
aspirations
working
in
groups
in
the
classroom
provides
a
multitude
of
benefits
for
both
students
and
instructors
alike
as
demonstrated
in
countless
studies
collaborative
learning
has
been
found
to
improve
outcomes
across
a
variety
of
disciplines
for
example
research
has
consistently
found
that
students
who
work
in
a
group
are
more
likely
to
participate
actively
in
class
discuss
material
more
thoroughly
and
be
more
successful
on
tests
than
those
who
work
alone
work
also
encourages
students
to
develop
critical
thinking
skills
as
they
must
synthesize
and
analyze
ideas
and
perspectives
to
come
to
conclusions
additionally
students
must
possess
effective
communication
and
social
skills
in
order
to
resolve
conflicts
and
reach
consensus
as
well
as
challenge
their
peers
in
a
respectful
and
productive
manner
in
contrast
when
students
work
independently
they
are
limited
in
their
ability
to
practice
and
apply
these
soft
skills
work
also
fosters
greater
collaboration
between
students
which
can
lead
to
the
formation
of
supportive
relationships
and
an
overall
more
positive
classroom
environment
for
example
working
in
groups
can
create
a
sense
of
unity
and
belonging
as
students
build
relationships
with
their
peers
exchange
ideas
and
work
towards
the
same
goal
this
can
result
in
enhanced
communication
and
understanding
as
well
as
mutual
respect
and
appreciation
for
each
other
s
perspectives
in
conclusion
the
advantages
of
working
in
groups
in
the
classroom
are
numerous
and
should
not
be
overlooked
by
instructors
through
group
work
students
can
learn
to
think
critically
and
effectively
communicate
with
their
peers
creating
a
more
supportive
and
engaging
learning
environment
having
a
positive
attitude
has
made
a
huge
impact
on
my
life
experiences
for
instance
when
i
moved
to
a
new
country
i
had
to
learn
a
new
language
having
a
positive
attitude
helped
me
stay
motivated
and
pushed
me
to
reach
my
goal
of
becoming
fluent
a
positive
attitude
also
helped
me
set
and
achieve
my
goals
i
was
able
to
stay
focused
and
stay
on
track
instead
of
getting
overwhelmed
and
giving
up
finally
when
i
was
helping
my
mother
out
of
a
difficult
situation
a
positive
attitude
allowed
me
to
be
there
for
her
without
getting
bogged
down
with
any
negativity
my
experiences
have
shown
me
that
a
positive
attitude
is
a
key
to
success
it
gives
you
the
motivation
to
keep
going
even
when
things
seem
difficult
a
positive
attitude
allows
you
to
stay
optimistic
and
focus
on
the
positives
in
life
with
this
mindset
i
believe
that
i
can
go
far
and
reach
any
goal
i
set
for
myself
technology
has
drastically
changed
the
way
humans
interact
with
one
another
on
one
hand
it
has
enabled
us
to
become
more
connected
to
people
around
the
world
making
long distance
relationships
possible
and
providing
us
with
a
wealth
of
information
about
the
lives
of
others
on
the
other
hand
it
has
also
created
a
form
of
disconnection
between
people
as
we
increasingly
engage
with
a
virtual
world
instead
of
the
physical
one
the
effects
of
technology
on
human
contact
can
be
seen
in
virtually
every
aspect
of
life
in
the
workplace
employees
can
now
communicate
more
effectively
and
efficiently
through
email
and
other
online
tools
this
has
led
to
an
increase
in
productivity
and
ease
of
communication
making
it
easier
to
stay
in
touch
with
colleagues
over
long
distances
on
the
other
hand
the
reliance
on
these
technologies
has
taken
a
toll
on
our
personal
connections
as
we
often
connect
with
our
coworkers
and
acquaintances
through
screens
instead
of
face to face
meetings
in
the
realm
of
social
media
technology
has
connected
us
to
people
in
unprecedented
ways
allowing
us
to
maintain
contact
with
long lost
friends
and
meet
new
people
from
all
over
the
world
however
the
sheer
amount
of
information
shared
online
has
created
a
feeling
of
competition
between
users
leading
to
comparison
and
envy
which
can
be
detrimental
to
our
mental
health
technology
has
impacted
the
lives
of
people
in
both
positive
and
negative
ways
while
it
has
enabled
us
to
more
easily
stay
connected
it
has
also
forced
us
to
prioritize
virtual
conversations
over
physical
ones
although
technology
has
made
communication
more
efficient
and
convenient
we
must
be
mindful
of
its
potential
to
hinder
our
relationships
and
maintain
balance
in
our
lives
as
an
employee
responsible
for
the

an
important
trait
to
cultivate

it
allows
the

a
deeper
understanding
of

can
lead
to
increased

in
the

a
powerful
asset
in
the
modern
workplace
work

provide
great
opportunities
for
people
looking
for
a
career
in

enforcement
not
only
is
the

with
opportunities
to

the

police
work
has
taken
on
many
forms
as
part
of
the
job
police
personnel
usually
patrol
high crime
areas
investigate
and
document
criminal
activities
and
provide
emergency
assistance
each
police
force
operates
its
own
set
of
laws
and
procedures
and
the
work
of
a
police
officer
might
be
different
in
one
place
to
another
in
terms
of
collaboration
and
teamwork
police
work
places
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
cooperation
between
officers
working
together
to
keep
the
public
safe
often
requires
officers
to
support
each
other
in
difficult
and
demanding
situations
respecting
the
importance
of
teamwork
and
friendship
in
the
workplace
can
also
help

technology
has
had
a
major
impact
on
peoples
lives
and
the
way
we
go
about
our
daily
activities
on
the
positive
side
technology
has
made
peoples
lives
easier
and
more
efficient
for
example
the

us
to
connect
with
friends
and
family
from
all
over
the
world
as
well
as
utilized
for
educational
and
business
purposes
automation
has
made
it
easier
for
us
to
complete
mundane
tasks
such
as
making
calculations
and
filing
paperwork
technology
has
also
greatly
impacted
the
way
we
consume
and
create
media
allowing
us
to
access
a
wealth
of
information
at
our
fingertips
however
technology
can
also
have
negative
effects
for
instance
too
much
time
spent
interacting
with
technology
can
reduce
our
communication
skills
leading
to
social
isolation
and
reduced
meaningful
real
life
conversations
advances
in
technology
can
create
conditions
for
job
displacement
and
unpaid
labor
as
companies
increasingly
rely
on
automated
systems
technology
can
also
be
used
for
nefarious
purposes
and
can
enable
mass
surveillance
and
other
privacy
invasion
practices
overall
technology
has
been
a
tremendous
boon
to
our
lives
but
it
s
important
to
remember
that
there
are
downsides

the
ability
for
students
to
attend
classes
remotely
via
online
video
conferencing
can
be
both
beneficial
and
detrimental
learning
from
home
allows
students
to
study
and
work
simultaneously
in
an
environment
they
are
familiar
and
comfortable
with
and
eliminates
the
need
to
commute
potentially
saving
them
time
and
money
on
the
other
hand
there
are
potential
distractions
that
can
arise
such
as
family
members
or
pets
in
the
home
or
students
choosing
to
opt
out
of
class
and
instead
spend
the
time
on
their
own
activities
additionally
it
can
be
more
difficult
to
connect
with
the
teacher
and
receive
help
from
them
as
limited
guidance
and
direct
feedback
may
be
provided
from
a
distance
ultimately
while
there
are
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
associated
with
attending
classes
remotely
it
is
essential
to
consider
each
situation
on
an
individual
basis
ultimately
with
the
right
mindset
and
dedication
remote
learning
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
students
allowing
them
to
master
new
skills
and
apply
them
to
real
life
situations
inactivity
and
lack
of
focus
are
common
issues
that
can
prevent
a
person
from
succeeding
in
their
tasks
identifying
how
individual
unique
styles
can
help
can
be
an
effective
way
to
stay
productive
for
example
if
you
are
a
visual
learner
create
charts
or
diagrams
to
facilitate
the
task
and
allow
yourself
to
better
understand
what
needs
to
be
done
if
you
are
more
of
an
auditory
learner
try
listening
to
music
in
the
background
as
you
work
additionally
it
might
be
helpful
to
take
breaks
to
get
up
walk
around
and
refocus
i
have
personally
found
that
short
breaks
help
to
energize
me
and
bring
me
back
to
a
more
productive
state
if
you
find
yourself
in
an
inactive
state
find
ways
that
you
can
motivate
yourself
this
can
be
done
through
setting
small
achievable
goals
and
rewarding
yourself
with
something
that
you
find
pleasurable
for
completing
them
this
will
help
to
shift
your
mindset
and
become
more
confident
in
your
capabilities
additionally
manage
your
time
to
ensure
that
you
are
utilizing
it
appropriately
and
making
progress
lastly
seek
help
and
support
if
needed
finding
people
who
can
help
you
stay
on
track
and
be
accountable
will
be
beneficial
in
keeping
you
driven
and
focused
and
lack
of
focus
can
be
overwhelming
however
by
recognizing
your
own
individual
style
you
can
develop
strategies
to
continue
to
move
forward
and
ultimately
to
succeed
the
debate
surrounding
the
issue
of
cellphones
in
school
is
complex
on
one
hand
providing
students
with
the
opportunity
to
have
a
cellphone
in
school
could
enhance
trust
and
communication
between
parents
and
teachers
and
could
also
enable
students
to
keep
up
with
their
work
and
contact
each
other
quickly
on
the
other
hand
the
presence
of
cellphones
in
school
could
be
a
huge
distraction
from
learning
as
students
can
become
easily
engrossed
in
their
devices
instead
of
focusing
on
their
education
other
concerns
include
potential
violations
of
rules
and
the
possibility
of
cyberbullying
it
is
clear
that
allowing
cellphones
in
school
requires
careful
analysis
and
consideration
of
its
potential
implications
making
our
own
decisions
in
life
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
rewarding
aspects
of
being
an
independent
adult
it
is
our
choices
that
help
define
our
lives
shape
our
outlook
on
the
world
and
in
some
cases
even
determine
our
destiny
however
making
our
own
decisions
can
be
a
daunting
task
fraught
with
challenges
and
difficulty
decisions
can
be
complex
and
require
careful
consideration
making
them
difficult
to
make
quickly
or
on
the
fly
additionally
the
consequences
of
making
the
wrong
decision
can
be
catastrophic
in
order
to
make
better
decisions
some
people
look
to
others
for
guidance
and
mentorship
taking
advice
from
people
we
trust
can
provide
valuable
insight
and
perspective
and
help
to
narrow
down
our
choices
other
people
just
need
more
time
taking
a
step
back
and
slowing
down
can
allow
the
right
decision
to
emerge
in
addition
having
an
open
and
honest
discussion
with
family
and
close
friends
can
help
support
the
decision making
process
and
provide
clarity
no
matter
what
approach
is
used
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
decision
making
process
is
highly
personal
and
that
the
ultimate
decision
lies
with
the
individual
every
person
must
approach
decisions
in
their
own
way
and
have
faith
in
their
own
judgment
by
making
our
own
decisions
and
trusting
ourselves
we
can
create
a
life
for
ourselves
that
is
meaningful
and
true
is
an
incredible
country
with
a
rich
culture
and
fascinating
technology
a
few
well known
dishes
from
include
sushi
sashimi
tempura
and
udon
crime
rates
in
are
some
of
the
lowest
in
the
world
making
it
a
safe
destination
for
travelers
although
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
explore
japanese
cities
such
as
walking
and
biking
the
most
popular
way
to
get
an
authentic
look
is
by
taking
the
shinkansen
bullet
train
watching
videos
of
people
visiting
is
a
great
way
to
get
an
idea
of
what
to
do
and
places
to
explore
while
on
vacation
in
addition
to
its
captivating
cities
and
tourist
attractions
learning
the
basics
of
the
japanese
language
is
an
excellent
way
to
immerse
oneself
in
the
culture
when
i
think
of
failing
but
still
achieving
success
two
personal
experiences
come
to
mind
while
preparing
for
the
i
studied
hard
for
over
four
months
but
still
achieved
only
mediocre
scores
yet
rather
than
giving
up
i
studied
more
compromises
and
eventually
scored
high
enough
to
gain
admission
into
the
college
i
wanted
to
attend
secondly
my
attempt
to
learn
guitar
was
hampered
by
my
lack
of
talent
and
i
kept
failing
every
time
i
tried
but
i
kept
at
it
and
eventually
taught
myself
well
enough
to
make
basic
melodies
and
chords
s
quote
success
is
not
final
failure
is
not
fatal
it
is
the
courage
to
continue
that
counts
has
had
an
impact
on
my
views
on
failure
it
has
made
me
realize
that
failure
is
just
a
stepping
stone
to
success
and
that
it
should
not
be
feared
but
embraced
rather
than
being
a
deterrent
to
success
failure
should
be
embraced
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
grow
i
also
recall
one
instance
when
a
friend
of
mine
quit
soon
after
attempting
something
difficult
even
though
i
had
tried
to
convince
him
that
perseverance
was
the
only
way
forward
he
seemed
to
have
given
up
seeing
him
give
up
so
easily
made
me
realize
how
important
it
is
to
be
willing
to
take
risks
and
keep
failing
until
we
eventually
find
success
i
believe
the
most
successful
people
are
the
ones
who
maintain
enthusiasm
for
success
even
after
failure
they
face
failure
evaluate
their
mistakes
and
keep
on
striving
for
greater
heights
with
a
positive
attitude
and
unceasing
determination
people
with
this
drive
to
never
give
up
no
matter
how
bleak
the
situation
may
be
truly
understand
that
failure
is
not
an
end
but
a
path
to
a
greater
success
making
decisions
about
our
future
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
rest
of
our
lives
we
can
look
to
many
successful
people
who
have
made
their
own
decisions
and
seen
the
positive
impact
they
have
had
in
their
lives
for
example
decided
to
drop
out
of
college
and
invest
his
time
into
starting
one
of
the
world
s
most
successful
companies
whilst
this
decision
was
brave
and
unorthodox
it
was
essential
for
him
to
reach
his
professional
goals
having
the
support
of
family
is
also
incredibly
important
when
making
decisions
about
the
future
not
only
will
it
provide
an
individual
with
a
sense
of
belonging
and
emotional
security
it
will
also
ensure
they
stay
grounded
and
make
rational
decisions
seeking
advice
from
others
is
also
beneficial
being
open minded
and
taking
diverse
perspectives
on
board
can
only
be
a
positive
thing
of
course
patience
is
also
vital
to
make
sure
that
our
dreams
can
be
gradually
achieved
over
time
in
conclusion
making
our
own
decisions
and
having
the
support
of
our
family
can
help
to
ensure
we
reach
our
goals
whilst
taking
advice
from
others
and
exercising
patience
can
also
be
beneficial
becoming
a
surgeon
requires
a
great
deal
of
dedication
and
hard
work
after
completing
undergraduate
schooling
individuals
must
go
through
four
years
of
medical
school
to
earn
a
doctor
of
or
of
after
completing
medical
school
individuals
must
complete
on
average
another
five
to
seven
years
of
residency
training
in
a
hospital
depending
on
the
specialty
in
order
to
receive
a
license
once
a
license
has
been
obtained
individuals
can
specialize
in
various
areas
such
as
cardiac
surgery
neurosurgery
orthopedic
surgery
general
surgery
and
plastic
surgery
committing
a
large
amount
of
time
to
the
job
is
essential
for
those
wishing
to
pursue
a
career
in
surgery
schools
should
offer
an
after
school
homework
club
in
order
to
support
students
and
their
academic
success
the
club
would
provide
a
place
for
students
to
complete
their
homework
with
the
help
of
their
peers
and
staff
there
are
three
points
to
consider
when
advocating
for
an
after
school
homework
club
access
to
the
resources
needed
more
contact
time
with
teachers
and
providing
a
community
support
system
an
after
school
homework
club
would
give
students
more
access
to
the
resources
they
need
to
complete
their
assignments
it
would
be
a
great
place
for
students
in
need
of
tutoring
or
help
with
their
homework
to
find
the
assistance
they
need
this
would
allow
them
to
move
past
any
challenging
subjects
and
have
the
ability
to
learn
more
effectively
the
club
would
provide
more
contact
time
with
teachers
that
can
provide
above
and
beyond
instruction
this
open
environment
would
allow
students
to
get
the
one on one
help
they
need
to
understand
course
material
in
addition
it
would
allow
teachers
to
observe
student
progress
in
a
less
formal
setting
and
provide
better
feedback
on
students
enrollment
and
test
taking
performance
finally
the
club
would
provide
a
community
support
system
for
students
it
would
be
a
space
for
them
to
talk
to
their
peers
over
a
common
interest
or
goal
homework
instead
of
a
distraction
like
social
media
this
would
be
beneficial
in
allowing
students
to
find
support
from
their
friends
and
allow
them
to
gain
confidence
and
self esteem
an
after
school
homework
club
would
give
more
access
to
the
resources
needed
a
chance
for
more
contact
with
teachers
and
provide
a
community
support
system
these
reasons
make
it
essential
that
schools
must
offer
an
after
school
homework
club
to
ensure
the
success
of
their
students
it
s
human
nature
to
be
afraid
to
make
mistakes
but
making
mistakes
is
part
of
life
and
often
leads
to
personal
growth
and
development
even
though
making
mistakes
can
be
discouraging
it
is
important
to
know
that
these
missteps
are
only
temporary
and
do
not
equate
to
failure
it
is
better
to
break
rules
than
never
to
have
taken
a
risk
at
all
making
mistakes
can

s
okay
to

amid
the

mistakes
can
be
immensely
helpful
in
striving
for
success
in
the
long
run
one
of
the
main
debates
of
for
many
students
is
whether
attending
classes
from
home
is
beneficial
or
detrimental
it
is
undeniable
that
virtual
education
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
must
be
deeply
considered
when
making
the
decision
of
whether
to
attend
classes
physically
or
virtually
for
starters
classes
from
home
allow
students
to
go
at
their
own
pace
as
well
as
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
work
on
their
own
and
on
their
own
time
this
can
lead
to
a
more
personal
and
self motivated
learning
experience
additionally
by
learning
from
home
there
is
no
need
to
worry
about
a
long
commute
this
can
free
up
more
time
for
studying
and
leisure
activities
furthermore
students
become
more
comfortable
using
technology
and
digital
tools
which
can
give
them
a
head
start
in
their
professional
career
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
numerous
negative
aspects
that
students
should
take
into
account
regarding
classes
from
home
as
virtual
instruction
eliminates
in person
contact
it
can
be
harder
to
expand
the
student
s
knowledge
base
and
nurture
their
creative
thought
processes
additionally
when
learning
from
home
students
can
sometimes
become
more
isolated
and
distracted
which
can
lead
to
a
decrease
in
concentration
low
motivation
and
reduced
academic
performance
in
conclusion
there
are
both
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
taking
classes
from
home
but
each
student
should
carefully
consider
their
own
situation
and
prioritize
their
individual
needs
when
deciding
whether
remote
education
is
the
best
option
for
them
the
implementation
of
a
curfew
for
teenagers
can
provide
numerous
benefits
for
both
the
teens
and
their
families
curfews
can
promote
safety
by
keeping
teens
off
the
streets
at
night
when
they
are
more
likely
to
experience
danger
they
can
also
provide
a
sense
of
structure
and
discipline
as
teens
must
adhere
to
a
set
timeframe
for
being
home
for
parents
curfews
can
provide
them
with
peace
of
mind
knowing
that
their
children
are
safe
and
secure
in
addition
curfews
can
help
teens
maintain
a
healthy
sleep
schedule
and
encourage
healthy
behavior
by
limiting
access
to
activities
that
may
be
deemed
as
bad
for
their
health
ultimately
the
benefits
of
a
curfew
depend
on
the
individual
circumstances
but
they
can
provide
a
safe
environment
for
teens
and
families
